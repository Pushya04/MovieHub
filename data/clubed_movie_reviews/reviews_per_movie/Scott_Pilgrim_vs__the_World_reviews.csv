A Delightfully Offbeat Comic Book Comedy,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, ""Knives"" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face ""It's okay, neither have I."" Or the band's self-introduction, ""We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Wildly creative and fun...but probably NOT for all tastes...,"""Scott Pilgrim"" is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it's probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you'll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don't worry, they are almost all very nice people!So what, other than originality, did I love about this film? Well, just about everything--and I seriously considered giving the film a 10--I liked it that much. Perhaps the best thing for me was casting of Michael Cera in the lead. Unlike the traditional super-hero, he is by far the geekiest and most likable main character I have seen. Seeing such a wimpy and unassuming guy become, out of no where, like a character from Mortal Combat was a wonderful juxtaposition--you just couldn't help but smile. And, despite his nerdy looks, he was winning as Scott Pilgram...and actually played the music his on-screen band played--now that's talent. Additionally, I loved the film's gentle sense of humor---I laughed harder at this film than any film I've seen in the theater in some time. I could try to describe these moments--you just need to see them for yourself. Odd references to games like DOA, Mortal Combat, Marvel Vs. Capcom and Zelda II were great--I caught on to those due to my own geeky background. And, my familiarity with anime/manga also made me laugh--as the hair, love for girls in school uniforms and style were often straight out of Japanese comics. And, I loved how the film made me love video games and was simply much, much more fun that the original ""Tron"" (which I always felt was too dry--perhaps the new version will correct this).Clever, wonderful and strange, this film is the geek's dream come true...and not a film to be missed. However, if you aren't a geek or are perhaps too old to get the pop references, I say take along an interpreter--many comic book nerds and couch potatoes would be glad to go with you and help explain things...provided you pay for the tickets.Among the nearly 9000 reviews I have now done on IMDb, this ranks in the hallowed ranks of a very small group of movies that transcended the pack due to its utter weirdness. It's surreal and weird--and I think this makes it very special. For other films that fall into this category, try ""The Happiness of the Katikuris"", ""Delicatessen"", ""Yes Nurse, No Nurse"", ""Tatie Danielle"" and ""Tampopo""--all truly unique, surreal and fabulous films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Edgar Wright vs the World,"There is no other movie quite like Scott Pilgrim. It's like watching a comic book video game put to screen. The action is insane, over the top and super high energy with wonderfully creative framing and visual cues.Going back and watching it again, it's amazing how many people are in this before they were huge. Brie Larson, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick just to name a few. The visuals still hold up, as does the pointed commentary on hipsters.Great music, great action, great performances. It's all around a fantastic experience. The only real downside to me is that it's based on something with a lot of content and in an effort to put a lot in here there are some moments that feel... Off. Areas where the graphic novel likely went into great detail yet the movie has to just sort of pop it in and run with it. These are mostly minor but it still prevents this from being absolutely perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Terrific!,"Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Great style,"Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a slacker hipster in a garage band who's dating high school girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is self-absorbed and willing to abandon Knives as soon as he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Before Scott can date Ramona, he must defeat her seven exes.Scott is a douche. The biggest problem for me is his unlikeability. It runs counter to Cera's usual good guy persona. Everybody is blasé and sarcastic which get some good laughs.The best thing about this is the 80s video game visual motif. Edgar Wright brings a fresh hip-without-the-irony sensibility. It also uses Toronto not as New York or as anything other than Toronto. It's refreshing and unique in a world where almost everything is a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Epic indeed,"The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something's life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.While the audience might've been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott should had stuck with Knives,"I guess I am not the age demographic that this film is based at but I liked it. My daughter loves it, she even made me by her the DVD.Scott Pilgrim is a magical realism/fantasy teen comedy with pop art video game visuals. Deep in its heart its just a hip, flashy teen romantic comedy.Edgar Wright better known as the director of the Cornetto Trilogy adapts this comic book series like it was an edgy fast paced pseudo Japanese video game.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) plays bass in his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who meets his dream girl Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who is new in town. However he is soon pursued by Ramona's seven evil exes who all challenge Scott Pilgrim to a duel and Scott needs to keep them in check with his zaps and zingers Streetfighter style.Cera has the right balance of geeky, slacker dude, Canadian hipster charm as Scott Pilgrim who is very likable even though he quickly ditched High School student Knives for Ramona.The Evil Exes are a colourful bunch with some star names amongst them. Chris Evans is a skateboarding movie star whose entrance is accompanied with the Universal Pictures theme tune. Jason Schwartzman is a megalomaniac record producer. Brandon Routh is a pretentious vegan rock star with the ability to fly just like Superman.There is a lot of scene stealing in this film like Kieran Culkin as Scott's sneaky gay roommate, Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister and particularly Ellen Wong as Knives the slightly too young ditched girlfriend who is still loyal to Scott.I actually found this to be a fast moving, quirky, rocking, enjoyable comedy drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Something unusually great,"I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I really wanted to love it. But I can barely even bring myself to like it.,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has made me question just how well I fit in with my generation. According to other members of my generation, it is the movie to end all movies, and the best movie... I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...Scott Pilgrim's first problem is the plot. The plot is self-conscious and repetitive, as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil ex's. That's the whole plot, and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn't matter in an effects-driven popcorn movie, but with nothing to root for, or no suspense of any kind, I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn't all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go, the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.Not to say the film doesn't have it's good points. Michael Cera, though not as witty as he can be, is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind, it is jam- packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout, and as a director Edgar Wright hasn't lost his talent. Unfortunately, the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me.Maybe it's because I don't play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I'm just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does, but I simply can't. I'll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 5/10 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of Edgar Wrights finest,"I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every Wright film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. Wright's trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the Seinfeld scene.Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of Edgar Wrights films or just good silly humour you will love this film.Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 Morgan",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Edgar Wright's precious little movie,"Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-something slacker living in Toronto, who basically leeches off his friends. Despite being in a ""relationship"" with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he keeps dreaming about another girl. He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.I did not think it was possible, but Edgar Wright has fairly successfully brought Bryan Lee O'Malley's epic graphic novel series to the big screen in the most uniquely entertaining way possible. It is his first adapted work, but it feels every bit as fresh (I use that word very loosely) as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did upon their initial releases. It deviates from the books a bit (much like Matthew Vaughn's excellent adaptation of Kick-Ass earlier this year), but the majority of the film stays true to the series and gives the fans everything they might expect from a Scott Pilgrim film. Right after the film opening with an 8-bit Universal logo and score, you know you are in for a treat.What propels Wright's epic and inspired vision is the editing style. All of the little idiosyncrasies, background/foreground items and ideas, everything that made O'Malley's books so revered in the graphic novel community are all in full force here. Some shots in the trailers suggest the comic book-style feel of the film, with the sounds of the actions appearing as words on-screen and the video game-related pop-ups appearing the same way they would in the game. But that is only the start. The entire film is filled with them, and with references to numerous pop culture entities (specifically video games), to the point that it looks and sounds like a ridiculously enhanced motion comic or game. Add to that the quick cuts and multiple panel style of the format, and you have the closest film representation of a comic since Robert Rodriguez attacked Frank Miller's Sin City.Even with all the nods and references to the original work, Wright's film still feels very much his own work. He makes Scott Pilgrim's epic quest to defeat Ramona's exes into an understated work you will likely not see replicated too soon. After seeing Christopher Nolan's Inception just under a week ago, I did not think that mainstream Hollywood would release something so blazingly original and something so astonishly unique so close together. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not nearly as strong a film as Nolan's masterpiece is, but Wright has clearly given it his all here. He has sidestepped away from following the lead of other comic book/graphic novel-style films, and has created something he can truly be proud of. The visuals on display are simply remarkable, and are worth the price of a ticket all on their own. The musical choices are even better. If you have seen the trailers, you are merely only getting a hint for what Wright has in store for you here.If I do have an issue, it is that the film is a little too exposition-heavy in the first half, and way too jumpy in the second. It never loses its tone or its style, but it becomes all too blatantly obvious where the books stop and the deviation begins. The pacing here is also a touch off, and on further research, thoroughly suggests there is material missing or altered from the final cut of the film. I understand that Wright and his co-writer Michael Bacall wanted to set-up the story and where it plans on going for the few who venture into the film without having read a single issue, but there is too much detail given in those early scenes, and not enough to pivotal moments later in the film.Another gripe, although it is one I hope will be less bothersome on repeat viewings, is that a good chunk of the characters feel incredibly underused. The books are stacked to the brim with an eclectic mix of supporting characters, who are present in the film, but they feel very stunted and get absolutely no development. Kim Pine (Alison Pill) is a very important character in the books, but she merely appears in the background here and delivers some of the best dialogue. Wallace Wells (the absolutely incredible scene-stealer Kieran Culkin) is the moral centre and source of an incredible amount of exposition, but he is barely in the film after the first half. Envy Adams (Brie Larson) almost feels like an extended cameo as opposed to an indispensible figure in Scott's character development. But then, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and especially Jason Schwartzman all deliver stunning performances as three of Ramona's exes, despite the lack of time on-screen.Cera on the other hand, is perfect as Pilgrim. The character plays a little too close to his stereotypical neurotic and off-centre archetype, but it works out beautifully here. He makes the character real, and brings a depth to Scott Pilgrim that no other young actor could. He has the right look and the right sound down pat. It was a little weird to see him get so physical in some sequences, but this is a vintage fit for Cera. Although they are downplayed more than I liked, Winstead and Wong are great as Ramona and Knives. They both have a certain edge throughout the film, and even at its most ridiculous, deliver strong performances. It helps too that they have insanely good chemistry with Cera.I jumped at the idea of an advanced screening of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and I do not regret seeing the film in the slightest. It is a bit of a niche movie, but it is one that is lovingly made through and through.8/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,"A very interesting movie I really enjoyed watching, my best character in the movie was Wallace, while the worst character was the Chinese girl, it was very annoying, the fights were fun, I felt that the movie was directed at me, I recommend watching it",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Supernerd strikes again,"The premise is this: Scott is a 22-year-old bass player in a terrible Toronto band. He falls for a ""dangerously fashionable, roller blading delivery girl"" with punk hair called Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an American transplant who ""starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties."" He's smitten. His cheery band-groupie high school girlfriend (""and she's Chinese"") Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) becomes irrelevant. The cool Ramona likes Scott too. But it turns out he must fight off Ramona's seven ""evil exes."" This iron-clad, if inexplicable, rule is going to shape all the reels to come.The dialogue is witty and smart, especially at first. A lot of cartoonish, video game captions in the air (""Pow,"" ""thunk,"" etc.) and other devices like scores and labels for new characters increase the feeling that this is a lively and quick-witted movie for and about the video game, texting, Facebook generation. Scott's intro line with Ramona is a silly factoid about the origins of the name Pac-Man, a bit of gaucherie he later denies. Cera has cool, quick delivery and good timing, which also help. So does the presence of Kieran Culkin (also a child star, from a child star family) as Scott's sarky, more mature gay roommate Wallace.Kieran Culkin is aging convincingly. But Cera, what of him? The androgynous, squeaky-voiced Canadian has been acting since he was eleven: he's a pro. Paradoxically, he projects his insecure young men roles with utter ease and confidence: there's got to be an element of the passive-aggressive in this whole nerd-superman concept. Though Cera's character is 22, and seems to have had a string of girlfriends, it's logical that Scott's dating a high school girl. Cera seemed fresh and charming in his first big roles. He can project a wistful, romantic quality that came through nicely in 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.' Now he seems to be playing roles tailored exclusively for him, like 'Youth in Revolt,based on a not-very-profound series of young adult novels (contrast the tougher, more honest writing of S.E. Hinton that produced a quartet of classic Eighties youth pictures). Youth in Revolt wound up rather limp as a movie -- and began to show Cera's lack of range, which is not disguised by the massive use of loud fast CGI for his duels with ex-boyfriends of his girlfriend here.Actually in 'Scott Pilgrim' Ramona is the character who seems most real. Winstead's speech sounds more sincere and less arch than anybody else's. Her character perhaps is so cool she need not put spin on her words.""They make movies in Toronto?"" So goes one of many cute throwaway lines in a movie that before it's burned up its cred brings many smiles, and plenty of full-on laughs too.But then 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's' fortunes go south. Strangely, this little indie comedy turns into a noisy CGI-ridden feast of pointless violence that makes you want to hold your ears and look at your watch. Why does this happen? One reason is that Edgar Wright, the director, hitherto renowned for the already classic zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead' and the charming, energetic cop comedy 'Hot Fuzz,' is English. Both films are deeply rooted in Englishness. If Toronto has a native spirit, Wright isn't tuned in to it. 'Scott Pilgrim' tries to be about so many things and the fault is in the writing. Why should Scott have to battle all these exes to begin with?Scott's forced battles become repetitious. The theme of repetition itself is forced on us. Not only is one of the exes actually twins. Scott himself is doubled at one point, and a movie star ex (occasion for that Toronto joke) turns out to have half a dozen stunt doubles who fight for him while he goes out for coffee. The climactic scene where Scott confronts rock impresario ex Brendan, played by Jason Schwartzman, another actor not aging well, seems heavy-handed. It's run twice, once with Scott's fighting strength empowered by love, the second by his need for self-respect. It's frankly hard to see much difference between these two versions. You may just wanted it to end. But it has to end twice, and the closing credits are very drab.The fight sequences have flashy moments and it's droll to have an androgynous nerd battling Superman (Brandon Routh) and, as the movie star, a champion skateboarder (Lucas Lee). Music for Scott's band, Sex-Bob-Omb, was written by Beck. A lot is going on, and many of the invasive visual tricks work because they speed up the action (all very youth-ADD-text messaging friendly). Nothing here is for slow people. If anything the trouble is not that Wright is a slouch, for he is anything but. It's that he tries too hard. That was true to some extent in 'Hot Fuzz.' And most of the characters introduced at the beginning who contributed to the feeling of being in a real place are thrown away, ceasing to matter, except for brief visual recognition, toward the end.At moments the wintry exteriors of Scott Pilgrim's Toronto and his too-cool, geeky, slightly depressed young friends will bring to mind Terry Zwigoff's 2001 'Ghost World,' also made from a graphic novel, also populated by slackers. Probably 'Scott Pilgrim' could have got by with a measure of its Pow! and Thunk! labels and cyber-world air battles, and still created something of the atmosphere and feel of real young lives as 'Ghost World' quite hauntingly does. But that didn't happen, and all I got was a metaphorical lousy T shirt saying I've seen another Michael Cera movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"7,000,000 points for this movie: comic KO!","Edgar Wright just keeps getting better as a director, and his latest offering after the good Shaun of the Dead and better Hot Fuzz is a kind of super-speed-surrealist take on young love and imagined video-game battles. It's a geek-storm of comedy, the kind of effort that we don't get too often in movies that are dictated down by committee and tested so much for laugh ratios. There are so many things that go on in a scene in this film that some of it will pass by your head. Or maybe not; maybe it's just the right tone for a combo platter of comic-book/anime/manga/8-bit-to-PS3-video-game movie that knows itself and knows its intended audience so well that it can be so POP in its sensibility. This is a super-comedy, suffused in melodramatic romance and fiery action, for people who still wonder what it's like to be surprised at the movies.I wish I could contain my enthusiasm for the movie enough, but it's hard to do. Wright pulls off such a high-wire act, the likes of which take me back several years ago to Kill Bill Vol. 1, or to comedy masters like Mel Brooks. The filmmaker just *gets* it, how to pull off material that is nothing too new but with an original eye and perspective for what's funny. And in this story- of Scott Pilgrim, a ""hipster"" with a band (of course) dating a 17 year-old Catholic high school Asian girl named Knives (of course) and who falls for another hipster girl, Ramona Flowers (beautiful Mary Winstead) who dyes her hair every several days and has seven (give or take one or two) evil ex- boyfriends (and a girlfriend) to fight to the death- the intensity and energy goes hand-in-OMFG-hand with the subject matter.But what's even more impressive, as it was also with Hot Fuzz, is how much affection Wright really has for not just his source material, but how people who dig the culture and nature of it so much. He clearly does enjoy what's hip in music, video games, clothes, hair, action movies and kung-fu fights, but also knows how to satirize it until it bleeds its own blood. And boy does he get some juicy satire here, always in the name of good fun and, indeed, some melodrama. As Scott (Michael Cera in a kind of amalgam of his on-screen persona to a perfect nth degree) goes through these evil ex's, each with their own ""quirks"" and super-powers, such as one being an egotistical movie-star jerk and mega- Vegan (Chris Evans and Brandon Routh respectively, also both brilliant), we see how his character does go through an arc, that it's not all just fun and games. If a video game like No More Heroes took the perfectly- confused love tale of (500) Days of Summer, it might look like this... kinda.What it comes down to is that for everything that is familiar, even down to the coins doing their EXPLOSION on the ground after a baddie dies, or how rock bands awesomely suck so much that they become awesome again, this is shot and scored and performed like nothing else you've seen this year, or most years. Wright keeps throwing things at the audience, and knows (or hopes) they'll keep up. At the same time it never bores with its (::I snap fingers::) rhythm, and, and if a joke doesn't fly to the sky it still gives some chuckles or belly laughs. Lines are instantly quotable, and one can't wait to tell friends and others about this character or this shot or punch, or how Jason Schwartzman reacts when he swallows his gum. It's a radioactive treasure trove of romantic comedy, blazing action, random beats, well-timed reactions and physical gestures, awkward longing, and lots of kick-ass rock songs.In other words, if you dig it, it will be the cult movie of your time.

"Fantastic Music and light show, this one will fill your senses and rock your world.","So I've been a fan of Edgar Wright since his first film Shaun Of The Dead. It's one of the funniest films I've ever seen and it's one of my favorite films of all time. I always love watching this movie.Hot Fuzz came out in 2007 and for some reason despite how much I loved Shaun Of The Dead I never saw either in theaters. I saw a huge poster for Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World a couple weeks ago after coming out of seeing Inception. I personally like Michael Cera and decided to look at it for a sec. I noticed that Edgar Wright's name was in the ""Directed By"" spot and that was that. I was seeing this film day one if I could. Well I just got back from a midnight showing. How's that for not missing out?I saw a trailer for this the first time this afternoon oddly enough (August 12). The trailer looked awesome and I HAD to see it tonight.Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is the ultimate boss of all nerd movies. There is no beating this one. Edgar Wright once again brought fantastic comedy writing to his newest film that his first two had. If you didn't like the comedy of those films, you probably won't here either. But then again you're an idiot go watch Epic Movie.Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is about the titular character finding a complete hottie named Ramona Flowers played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. He wants her and goes for it. Unfortunately for him she has 7 evil ex's who are in an Evil Ex's League. Scott has to fight and defeat them all if he wants to win and keep the heart of his lovely Ramona.This film is insane. The nerdgasms come at you along with the laughs one after another. There's no stopping them. If you have played videos games or have any type of understanding of them in almost any form, then this movie shouldn't be too hard to follow. Characters fight in crazy game like fashion and get points and level up throughout the movie.Cera is usually known as ""that awkward kid"" in pretty much everything he's in. That's still here in the beginning however once he finds his purpose as the film goes on that really fades away. The action scenes always show Pilgrim VS someone else in typical fighting game fashion. There's Zelda music played throughout people have hearts and lifebars and seeing as how this film originated from a comic there are a lot of sound effects shown on screen similarly to how they used to do on the old Batman show...but not lame.This movie is wonderful. Everyone gives a terrific performance and all the villains Pilgrim has to face give over the top awesomeness every second they're in the film. This movie is joy from beginning to end and really entertains front to back.SUCK ON THAT MICHAEL BAY.Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets **** stars out of four. Exactly what it deserves. You won't learn anything after watching this, but you'll still love yourself for it either way. I will say that after seeing this, while walking back to my car I realized this film is a reminder as to why I want to even direct movies in the first place.

"Excellent, Brilliant !!!!!!!  REFRESHING","This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong.I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers.I truly left the movie saying that "" I cant wait to see more films put out by ""Oni Productions/Closed on Mondays "". Well done !!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Horrible morals, cool execution","I recognize and admit that this is a good film, arguably even a great one. It has a very unique sense of humour, a visual style that's one of the few I've seen that manages to capture the essence of comic books and a character cast that's certainly memorable if not identifiable. That being said, I still loath this film. I do not like it. However, I have given it seven out of ten, because I can admit that the reason I don't like this film has nothing to do with its quality. Rather I hate its roster of characters, especially the main cast, and its morals.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a movie about a young man. The youngster in question isn't even that interesting. He's in a band, sure, but otherwise he's kind of a wimp. The kind of a nerd that other nerds will feel superior towards. Plus he's kind of an asshole, cheating behind the backs of his girlfriends just because he's too much of a coward or perhaps just too lazy to break up with them. He's not an admirable man, yet the whole movie revolves around him and his decisions. His ""heroics"". Now, some might claim that Scott is a perfect main character because of this, because he's the perfect everyman. Perhaps a bit of a pessimistic version of one, but still, he's very bland and normal, only the circumstances into which he is thrust upon are extraordinary. I however argue that a) he's an asshole and not at all likable, and b) movie's are supposed to inspire us, to show us something that we don't see in our everyday life.At this point someone will argue that not every film has to be all about moral triumph and the nobleness of human mind. And that person would be right. I'm not claiming that my viewpoints have any kind of superiority here, they're only my personal take on this film. But I think that my viewpoints have relevance as they're one way to look at this film, a rather rare way from what I've gathered, but a way nonetheless. And sometimes the more extreme opinions, the rarer ones, are the ones worth sharing.But as I've said, this is not a bad film. It has style, its actions scenes are some of the best there are, its dialogue is very fast-paced and brimmed with jokes and double meanings. And while I think that most characters in this film aren't pretty loathsome human beings, I cannot claim that they do not feel realistic. Their behaviour is sometimes very outlandish and caricature-like, but beneath all that they're still just like people that I've met and known in real life. The morals and worldviews of this film are pretty horrible, but perhaps the reason I hate the film so much is because the message hits so close to home. It's quite possible that I just don't want to face the truth.So yeah, in the end I feel that I have to recommend this film to you. I personally don't like it, but it's just me. Love it or hate it, you at least owe it to yourselves to see this film and form your own opinions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fantastic!,"Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An Epic of Epic Epicness,"After success in Britain making Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has been given the chance to direct a Hollywood film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. And Wright was does not disappoint with this action, comedy comic book adaptation.Set in the Canadian city Toronto we follow our hero Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a slacker dating a 17-year-old high schooler Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) and the bass guitarist for the Sex Bob-omb. But Scott is recovering from a nasty break up and he falls literally for the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He tries to win her over, but there is a big problem, he has to defeat her seven evil exs, including Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh), Roxy Ritcher (Mae Whitman) and the worst of them all Gideon (Jason Schwartzman).Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a visually rich film, with Wright literally makes a live action comic book. He brings in the style of the comic book into the film with little visual touches like words coming up onto the screen, using images from the comic for telling some backstory to using panels to great affect. The fights were done with incredible skill and Wright employs the style of Capcom beat-'em-ups, with the opening of a fight shot like a landscape and used visual lettering like in though games. The fights were wonderfully shot and edited, with the camera placed in the right areas and shows that Paul Greengrass style shaky-cam and quick cutting is not needed: audiences want to see what happens in a fight scene. Wright also employ other video game references, like the extra life was reminded me of the Sonic the Hedgehog games I enjoyed in my youth, 3D beat-'em-ups like Virtual Fighter and Soul Calibur and arcade games like Donkey Kong. There is also a video game style score to go with the indie-rock preformed by the bands.There is a great amount of comedy in the film. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World starts out a witty, dialogue that offers smiles and chuckles, but no real belly lasts: yet they include later on there are more jokes, involving clever observations, great characters, physical humour and how real young people. Wright and graphic novelist Bryan Lee O'Malley do understand both young people and how pop culture. Much of the humour is very sarcastic, particularly from the female characters.There is a excellent cast. Cera gave his best performance as a slacker with personal baggage and well cast. Winstead too was brilliant as Ramona Flowers, leaves plenty of mystery in her character and well, she has a great body: I particularly like her fight with Whitman as Roxy Ritcher. Wong was good as Knives and also fun to look, I enjoyed her naïve young girl act who is just excited to be dating someone older but not confidence about doing anything with Scott. She grows as a character. Alison Pill and Anna Kendrick both offer a lot of sarcastic humour and do it very well: Pill did have a good supporting role but I would have liked to have seen more of Kendrick. Kieran Culkin had a good as Wallace Wells, Scott's gay roommate who is a gossip and willing to annoy people, but a good friend when it court. Culkin is smart simply plays the character as a normal man who happens to be gay, not a gay man, his performance was more natural that way. Out of the exs Schwartzman is perfectly slimy as the leader of evil exs, Routh was very funny as a dimwitted psychic with no morals and hopefully he will get to play Superman again and Evans was very good as an over the top action star with a deliberately gruff voice and speaking in action clichés. Whitman was also good in performance.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a excellent alternative comic book film, one of the best. It can stand along side films like Sin City and 300 and it is an excellent action-comedy. But I still think Kick-Ass is the best comic-book adaptation of 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Nerds unite...Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies of the year, barring you're a 16-26 year old male who likes video games and Asian Catholic school girls.","Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies I've seen all year. Sure, it's marketed towards nerds, gamers, and comic book geeks, but that doesn't mean it's not accessible to the average movie goer, or at least the average male movie goer ages 16-26. It's cute, energizing, and entertaining with good music, hot chicks, and some hardcore, sword fighting, skateboard slinging, karate chop chopping battle scenes that look like they were ripped out a Street Fighter vs. Speed Racer online battle. Enough with the nerd lingo though, let's get to the plot.Scott Pilgrim got his heart broken. His rebound is a 17 year old Asian Catholic high school girl. It doesn't get anymore cliché than that. She's cute, but annoying, and when he meets the new girl, with enough pink hair and indie outerwear to make an emo boy drool, he undoubtedly falls in love. The problem? For some reason, the new girl has seven evil exes, all bound to make an appearance on the battle field when Scott least expects it. What follows is hot, hilarious, and, at times, outrageous with scenes that give any recent action flick a run for it's money when it comes to entertainment.Regardless of the high energy adrenaline that runs through Scott Pilgrim, you've got to wonder, is it funny? I can say wholeheartedly that I laughed, at times, out loud. It's little nuances that Michael Cera has down to a T, that truly make the movie. I can't necessarily say why he's so funny in this film (and I didn't particularly like him in Juno), but he is. Rather than model the character after the comic book, it seems like the character was almost carved out of Cera himself. What results is very frequently funny.So what are the negatives? For one, the film is a little bit long. Not only are there seven battle scenes, but some of them are drawn out way too long (especially the final scene). There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and in Scott Pilgrim, we see it. Also, there isn't always enough differentiation between battles. By the end of the movie, things feel a bit stale and fall a bit flat as opposed to the opening scenes that set the stage. Lastly, as much as I praise Cera for his spot on performance in the film, I also have to give him a slightly negative critique when looking at his character because he is such a loser, yet he manages to score some really sexy chicks. I know it's a movie and anything is possible, but seriously, Scott Pilgrim wouldn't be in the running for any of these girls regardless of what band he's in.All in all, Scott Pilgrim offers some good, fun, mindless entertainment. It's smart, funny, cute, and cuddly, and I'd especially recommend it for teenagers and males ages 16-26. Would I recommend it to my parents? No. The indie guy down the hall that watches foreign films? No. The film student who prefers documentaries? No. Anyone looking for a fun tribute to video games, heartache, and progressive rock music?

Most enjoyable film I've seen (so far) this year!,"I heard many good things about this movie before I went to see it. Even so, I didn't go in with too many expectations I wasn't disappointed. This was probably the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far this year. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face and there was even a spring in my step as I went over the preceding 112 minutes in my mind.Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old living in Toronto, Canada with his gay flatmate, Wallace Wells. Scott plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb which consists of Scott (of course), Kim Pine on drums, Stephen Stills on lead vocals and guitar and Young Neil as hanger-on. The band has ambitions to be famous and so have a gig coming up at a Battle of the Bands show. At the start of the film he is dating a seventeen year old schoolgirl called Knives Chau. Things seem to be going along quite well until Scott has a vision of a girl called Ramona Flowers. He becomes besotted by her and they end up hanging out together and eventually dating. Unfortunately Scott soon learns that if he wants to date Ramona he must first defeat her seven evil exe's! Can Scott defeat these evil exe's and win Ramona? What will Knives think of his infidelity? All these questions and many more remain to be answered until you've seen the film of course.As I said at the beginning, this was probably the most enjoyable film I've watched so far this year. I found the quirky mix of live action with comic book elements quite refreshing and it gave the film an interesting look and feel that I liked a lot! Great performances all round, especially from Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells, Mark Webber as Stephen Stills, Alison Pill as Kim Pine and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau.This will most certainly feature in my best of the year awards in December. It did start to lose me a bit towards the end, but I won't hold that against it. A really well made film which deserves the praise it has got (IMO). Well worth the entrance fee and very highly recommended.My score: 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Beautiful from start to finish,"It has been along time since I enjoyed a movie from start to finish. This was that movie. This film was jam packed with action, laughs and just lovable characters you want to see more and more of. Michael Cera was a pretty good choice for Scott. I mean usually Cera only has one type of way to act and somehow it really did fit for Pilgrim. It will take me forever to explain how much I liked the cast, so I will only pick a choice few. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great as Ramona. She had the look you could picture from the comic itself. Then you have Ellen Wong as Knives. The way Ellen acted in this film really brought out have Knives really was in the comic. Out of the evil Ex's, I really enjoyed Jason Schwartzman. He just had an overall cool yet kept feeling and at a point you really wanted him to fight more against Pilgrim. The other Ex would have to be Brandon Routh. I really cannot stand him as Superman, but this role he got to act more like his personality. I mean every actor has a dream to act as a crazy character, because then they can be more comfortable. I think Brandon was very comfortable in the role. The movie had a beautiful look to it with great nerdy CG throughout. The movie did have two problems though. The fight scenes were not long enough. This is because the movie was almost two hours and it is hard to fit seven fight scenes in to seven Ex's. But even though they were short, the look, feel and graphics to them still really made them exciting. The other problem is that I know this film will never has a perfect rating overall because it really only fits to a certain type of people. Luckily there is a lot of people who will love this movie like I did, but in the world today, this film will probably not win an academy award; and that is sad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Simply Awesome,"While I realize that this movie is not for everyone, I cannot think of a more inventive, unique, heartfelt, and fun movie I have seen in theaters recently. To me, the movie is more than just a spectacle. Sure, the special effects are amazing, the fight scenes awesome, and the visual style extremely entertaining. To the contrary of what many critics are saying, I thought the movie worked great on an emotional level as well. Scott Pilgrim is completely relatable to anyone unsure of where their life is headed, and every teenage boy understands his plight. He's played to perfection by Michael Cera as an unconventional hero, one who is sometimes a jerk, but nevertheless wants to do the right thing. The contrast of this realistic character with the ridiculous world which he inhabits keeps the movie grounded, even when an Indian scenester is performing a Bollywood dance number for no discernible reason.Don't get me wrong: the movie is completely insane, but in a wonderful, devil-may-care sort of way, rather than feeling like a carefully calculated marketing ploy. The crazy fight scenes could have gotten tired by the end, and the movie could have been an exhausting experience. Instead, every fight scene is filmed with a sense of child-like wonder, making the movie feel uplifting and energizing rather than it pounding the audience into submission. The complete lack of rules and the possibility of anything happening keeps these scenes entertaining throughout the entire movie.I also find this movie beautiful in a way like no other. Of course, from a visual standpoint the special effects are top notch, and the scenes well shot. But it is also beautiful for other reasons. The ethereal moments such as when Scott dreams about Ramona roller blading to his door, the awesome soundtrack/score which perfectly accentuates the different moods in the movie, and the contrast of a simple, almost naive love story amongst the craziness all compound to make it an almost transcendent experience.To me, this movie works on all levels: emotional, visual, and even spiritual. But above all, its original. It saddens me that the American movie-going public has mostly ignored this movie, choosing instead to view mindless garbage such as The Expendables and Eat, Pray, Love. After viewing the movie 2 times, I still love it, and think a lot of other people would too if they just gave it a chance. So do yourself a favor and go see this movie. Even if you don't love it as much as me, you won't see another movie like this for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
2010 continues to impress me,"Though I could probably rave for hours tonight, I'll try to keep this short. After Kickass and Inception, I thought that for sure, 2010 would be plumb out of good movies. But oh boy. Like the other reviewer said, as the Universal Logo appeared in like an 80x50 resolution accompanied by a midi track, I knew this was going to be good. I somehow managed to make it through the seizure inducing beginning credits, then the movie took off. It was maybe a little slow for a few minutes, but now I realize it was only preparing me for the awesomeness to follow.Anyways, the acting was superb, and I completely have a new lovecrush on Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She could_not_have_been_hotter. In fact the whole movie is overrun with a cast that would steal the show in any normal movie, but here it's just a big collection of great young actors, which we rarely get to see. I think inevitably, and very unfortunately, this will be compared to Kickass, and that almost makes me sad, but also makes me happy that I'm getting to see both in the same year.So basically, if you've ever been into random games such as say, Zelda, Final Fantasy, well, you REALLY might not want to miss this one. It's not the perfect movie, but I think the director would shoot himself if it was. It's an entertaining movie, and while on one hand, the nerdier you are the more you'll get it, I think there's a lot to laugh at here for everyone. It gets my utmost endorsement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim v The World is the Sex-Bob-Omb!,"I was lucky enough to get into one of the Scott Pilgrim vs The World screenings at the San Diego Comic Con (the 3rd screening Saturday night specifically). Thought I'd chime in and give a review. I first need to start off by saying a movie like this was tailor made for a guy like me. I've grown up playing video games (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mario, etc.), I used to be big into comics, and I loved Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I also am a huge Arrested Development fan, and even though Michael Cera is type cast, you gotta love yourself some George Michael. And Superbad is awesome. And I'm a fan of a lot of the other cast members too. ANYWAY, with a background like that it would be hard to not like a film like Scott Pilgrim.On top of that, the crowd at the Balboa Theater was pretty much filled with like minded people, 1,800 comic con nerds/geeks/fan boys/girls. All of whom had been waiting in eagerly in line for hours for the screening. And on TOP OF THAT, Edgar Wright came out to introduce the film and the entire cast of the movie (Michael Cera, Mary E Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman's mustache, Ellen Wong, Satya Bhabha, Bill Hader (he does the voices), Mark Webber, Mae Whitman (her?) and...I think that's it, I might be missing someone, idk). They all came out one by one throwing swag into the crowd getting everyone even more excited (M. Cera threw out a mask of a monkey which my friend caught, I believe he was wearing this on the Con floor incognitosneaky).So, suffice it to say that they warmed the already geeked out crowd up pretty well. And when you get a group like that together it can cloud your judgment, for example when the Phantom Menace when it came out I saw it filled with a bunch of Star Wars honks dressed up and waving light sabers. The movie seemed awesome at the time, but it was more just the atmosphere and nostalgia (we all know that movie sucked). After a second or third viewing you come to realize that. So that is the WARNING on my review. It could possible by skewed. However, I am going to go out on a limb and say that even though the atmosphere at my viewing was amazing, it did not cloud my judgment and that this movie truly does KICK ASS!From the second the Universal logo game out in 8-bit with a midi style theme song I knew I was going to enjoy what I was watching. SPvTW starts off strong and doesn't really let off the gas. And that's part of its charm. The whole movie has ADD. It understands what type of movie it is and doesn't take itself too serious, quite the opposite in fact, like when the Seinfeld theme song kicks on out of nowhere with accompanying laugh track, or how the exes turn into a pile of coins when they are defeated. This movie has a lot going on, from outrageous fight scenes, awesome music to amazing visual effects. It's really quite ambitious. And Edgar pulls it off.I'm sure you all know the plot (Scott hearts girl, much defeat exes, gets to pick up coins) so I won't go too much into that. The acting I thought was really good. The actors all have great chemistry and I Keiran Culkin steals some scenes (and boyfriends) as Scott's gay roommate. Michael Cera isn't too overly Michael Cera in this movie and I actually believe that the character could score a Ramona Flowers played by Mary E Winstead. I think this could be Michael's best role.What surprised me the most is how cool the fight scenes where. They were very fun, especially the fight between Ramona and Roxy played by Mae Whitman (her?). And I loved how people just burst into outrageous Street Fighter-esqe fights and no one really thinks it is odd.OK, this review is getting long so I'm going to just start listing off awesome parts – Brandon Routh as dumb vegan ex = so funny, Zelda song during dream sequence = win, Final Fantasy bass line = awesome, Beck doing a song in the film = sweet, Jason Schwartzman wielding an 8-bit Katana blade = badass, Soundtrack = a must download.Really, this movie is just stuffed to the brim with fun. Epic fun. I've never seen a movie like it to be honest. So despite being catered to by the cast and director (they came out after the show as well, this time with Thomas Jane). I believe I would have enjoyed the movie either way. I'm excited to see it again when it comes out with a normal crowd to see how they react. I'm also really curious to see how some older critics view the film as this is definitely aimed to the 30 and under crowd. I have a feeling some aren't going to get it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Vegon! Be gone!!!""","""Scott pilgrim vs The World""...or more suitably ""Scott Pilgrim vs The 7 super-powered evil Ex's"" (doesn't quite have the same ring to it) is a hyper-active action comedy extravaganza perfect for today's A.D.D. generation of short attention spans! The fast-paced action-packed visual style of the film and it's humorous, witty and catchy one-liner dialogue will keep anyone with a Goldfish's attention span up-right in their seats, drool leaking from their mouths and eyes firmly planted on the screen for the full duration of the film!Geeks, nerds or just anyone with too much time on their hands and lack of social-life will delight in the many video game and pop-culture references spliced throughout the film. The films slick editing and cartoon/comic book visual style is superbly executed and despite the film being outlandishly random, it all seems to make perfect sense in the fictional world it is weaved in.Michael Cera plays a slight variant on his ""Arrested Development"" persona as the title character, Scott Pilgrim - a nerdy, awkward bass player and video game enthusiast who's had his fair share of bad luck with the ladies. Yet the real star of the film has to be Kieran Culkin as 'Wallace Wells', Scott's gay room-mate. He is hilarious and gets all the films best lines. I couldn't help think throughout the film just how much he resembles Mike Patton! If they ever do a film on 'FNM' - they should most definitely cast Kieran as Patton!!! The music is also pretty good and all the tracks performed by Scott's band; ""Sex Bob-Omb"" were suitably composed and arranged by the genre bending artist 'Beck'.Though it may not be everyone's cup of tea (herbal/green/sleep, etc) - the film never ceases to entertain and it's humour, stylised visuals and fight scenes pack more punch than most films out this year (excluding 'Expendables' which I have not yet seen). There are also some amusing cameos thrown in as a bonus in an amusing scene involving 'Vegans'!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the best video game movies ever made... and it's based on a graphic novel!,"For starters, I'll say that I have read the first few graphic novels in the Scott Pilgrim series by Bryan Lee O'Malley and had seen a couple of trailers, so I thought that I had some idea what to expect as I went to a pre-release screening in Omaha. Still, my expectations were blown away. To bring such content to the big screen from a graphic novel is always a challenge, and with the content being so video-game centric, perhaps even more so. However, Edgar Wright clearly overcame the challenge with great casting, good pacing, and what I can only call appropriate special effects.From the appearance of the Universal logo and music at the beginning all the way to the end (well, the start of the credits, at least), I found the movie an incredibly fun experience, with many laughs at sight gags, one-liners, and the random geekery that the people who made the film obviously knew that their target audience would be looking for. Additionally, a good soundtrack surrounds much of the on-screen action.I know that there are people who just think that Michael Cera is the worst thing since unsliced bread, and these are people who should clearly avoid this film for the sole reason that it contains Michael Cera. I think he works well in this role. There are times where the actor can make or break a film, but I don't see Cera breaking this film.Scott Pilgrim probably won't be breaking any box office records, but I'd like to think that word of mouth can help this film get the attention it deserves from the audiences that would most appreciate it, which would be those who enjoy classic video game culture and the interesting characters in this film who live in a world which many a Nintendo Power subscriber could only dream of.Just don't go in thinking you're going to see Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, as you'll likely be disappointed. This is a very different film, but I would say that it's trying to have as much fun as either of Wright's other two most popular films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Fun movie for all ages,"I keep seeing people post it's a good movie for kids. I agree with this however, if you're a gamer or into comic books you will like this movie as well. I'm 28 and my girlfriend is 31 and we enjoyed this movie thoroughly.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a thrill ride with non-stop action. Scott Pilgrim must defeat the 7 exes of his new love interest. The over the top action and funny one liners will keep you stuck in your seat for the full 2 hours. Video game references mixed with a comic book feel make this picture unique and interesting all at once. The art style is unlike anything I've seen in a movie and I enjoyed the direction of Edgar Wright (director of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz).The performance by Kieran Culkan as Wallace was fantastic. He plays Scott Pilgrims homosexual roommate and never fails to entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Excellent Film, But Over-hyped","What to say, what to say? I had heard good things about this film for a while, an recently those good things reached a crescendo, with two of my most trusted movie advisers both recommending it. And, I am sad to say, as good as it was, it just did not meet the hype. Primarily because it was too long.You have the dorkiest man in Hollywood, Michael Cera, and another arch-dork, Jason Schwartzman. And you have a female lead who I consider one of the top five hottest women in the world, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. So that is a great cast, not including all the bonus guest stars. (Sadly, I should be clear, Winstead did not look attractive at all in this film, being shown up by Ellen Wong.)Another reviewer says the film is ""quite possibly the most original and fresh movie of the decade."" That is a bit extreme, but not without merit. I would be hard-pressed to find another movie similar to it. There are some ""Kill Bill"" moments, but the first is clearly more inspired by Beck, Nintendo (with some obscure references, such as Clash at Demonhead) and the original graphic novel.The same reviewer says the film is ""not a perfect movie and hardly could be called a masterpiece."" I think this is true on a film levels. While the film clearly has great visuals and a sense of humor I appreciate, it spends too little time on character development and runs on the long side by having 7 evil exes. 5 would have been enough, and kept the pace more smooth. The fight scenes started to get repetitive.The reviewer claims this is ""the ultimate love story: a guy fights an army for his loved one."" And that is a valid point, except I disagree. Scott Pilgrim hardly ever gets to know Ramona Flowers (again, little character development) beyond the fact she had seven exes... she is not worth that much trouble. And then you have his other love, whose only flaw is that she is in high school. They seem a better match.I would love to respond to Roger Ebert's review, but he did not write one. (Apparently, he was writing his memoirs at the time.)Some have tried to find a deeper meaning in the film, some criticism of pop culture. I do not know about that. Anyway: great film, full of nostalgia, and a really good concept. But runs on the long side, and if the fight scenes had been shortened to expand the characters a bit, it would have been an even better movie... as it is, a guilty pleasure but probably not a long-lasting film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD (Edgar Wright, 2010) **1/2","Touted as a cult-classic-in-the-making, I decided to check this out – despite being lukewarm on the director's popular earlier effort SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) – on the strength of the not dissimilar but far superior KICK-ASS (2010). This, in fact, concerns a geeky young man turning unexpectedly into a hero; still, it is not a typical comic-strip adaptation – what it is, I am not really sure, except to say that it epitomizes the film-as-video-game mentality!Mind you, it is all somewhat enjoyable (especially the incongruous camaraderie –including Scott's gay room-mate and members of his rock group being named Stephen Stills and Young Neil!) yet too silly to leave much of a lasting impression. The plot involves the titular character falling for a mystery girl (winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I had watched in four previous films yet only now did she catch my attention!) but, in order to be with her, he has to first defeat her seven former flings and also drop his own current lover, an underage Japanese girl!The villains include special guest stars – the term is to be used lightly here – like Chris Evans (an ex-Fantastic 4 and soon-to-be Captain America!) as an arrogant movie idol, Brandon Routh (the most recent Superman) as a vain alien(!) and Jason Schwartzman as the evil boss of the lot, the very music mogul to whom the hero's outfit would be signed if they were to win a battle-of-the-bands-type contest; three other opponents were fellow participants (two of them twins), and yet another a lesbian!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
14 years later and something must have changed,"I keep seeing this pop-up on Amazon. Prime and have heard wonderful things about it over the years, so I tried to watch it.

"Scott Pilgrim: 7,000,000,000     The World: 0","""An epic of epic epicness"" was the catch phrase of the movie, and really the best way to describe the movie. SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD fully delivers on all the hype that it's built. From the 8-bit Universal logo to the video game form of Scott beating up the ""THE END"" after the credits, the movie is just sheer entertainment.At first, I wasn't sure. I saw Michael Cera's name and immediately shrugged it off. I've never been a fan of Cera and he wasn't the selling point for me in the least for this movie. What were the selling points for me were Edgar Wright (Director of SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ) and the visual style of the whole movie.SCOTT PILGRIM is the first, true comic book/video game movie. I want to say that it's more of a live action comic book/video game than a movie. Everything from life bars, ""WHACKS!"" and ""SMACK!"" coming up in giant letters in the back ground, it is the most unique visual styles I've seen in years, probably ever.At its core, SCOTT PILGRIM is a love story. What I love about this love story is that neither of the main characters are perfect. Both are extremely flawed characters. Scott is kind of a douche as he falls in and out of love with multiple girls, while Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has major commitment issues. And while I found myself disliking Scott from the get go and being fairly indifferent about Ramona when she comes on, they have very good arcs that made me rooting for them when the time came to really care.I also really like the supporting cast is nearly flawless. I'd say the highlight would be Kieran Culkin as Scott's ""Cool gay roommate"" Wallas. Every scene with him is gold. He's got this off beat charm and great comedic timing that just feels extremely genuine. While at times it can be a bit stereotypical, it's never offensive. Just slightly exaggerated for the sake of comedy.Along with him, Julie Powers (Aubrey Plaza) has one very memorable scene that I don't even want to hint at. It's used just enough to get substantial laughs without overstaying its welcome. I do feel that other supporting actors were underutilized like Anna Kendrick who plays Scott's sister. She's not in the movie much, but she's always a pleasure to see.The story alone is great, and without that, the rest of the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective. Now I could have seen this as another mindless, hack 'em slash 'em, action fest event movie, but the effective story just makes the fun parts of the movie so much more to invest in. And when this movie gets fun, it holds nothing back. It may be a turn off for some to see the over-the-top action set pieces, but if you've seen the trailer, you know what to expect.Edgar Wright is a masterful director. If a lesser director had this project I doubt it would have been half as fun. Every set piece and fight sequence is extremely well shot with the camera far back enough where you can actually see what's going on. And there are shots long enough to see several moves be thrown back and forth between 2 or more characters. I can't recall any extremely close up and quickly cut fights in the movie.What's also cool is that you can actually see that some of the actors throw a portion of the moves themselves. Yes, there were doubles for the flips and stuff we all know Cera can't pull off, but it's not in the least bit distracting. We can buy it because of the universe that's set up for the film.SCOTT PILGRIM's world is as if they were actually in a comic and/or video game. It's got this surreal vibe and style to it that's fully entrancing and immersive. It helps tremendously with the ridiculous set pieces with high flying maneuvers and normally impossible moments. Really, the best way to describe it is ""f***ing awesome!"" It's a geek's paradise world. Small things from a ""pee bar"" and ""ding dong"" text appearing in thin air or being able to put a hat on that you didn't even have in your possession instantly on a moments notice to being able to leap 15 feet in the air and remain up there for several seconds as you pound the 65 hit combo or survive being thrown 70 feet into the side of a tower falling 5 stories.I can't really do the film justice for the experience it delivers. Both INCEPTION and SCOTT PILGRIM have given us true innovation. As for which is better is really up to taste. I think INCEPTION is probably a better movie, but I think SCOTT PILGRIM trumps it in pure entertainment value. It is an intelligent, geek fueled movie. I will say INCEPTION does have the greatest single set piece in recent years, but SCOTT PILGRIM has one of the coolest worlds created since TRON.""F**k yeah!"" were the words that I said when the credits came up. SCOTT PILGRIM was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a theatre. While I'll wait until further viewings to place this in my favorite movies, I can definitely see this making it in my top movies of all time as far as how much I enjoyed it. It is my favorite film so far in this disappointing year. It's definitely something I'll watch at least 3 more times in theatres, and I suggest everyone see this in one, with a crowd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Sparkles after Hitting,"This is the most fun I've had at the movies for a while. I believe is it because it is inventive in several ways and the inventiveness is coherent through the thing and across the narrative pathways (cinematic effects, narrative rhythm, character reactions). It is not difficult to push the envelope in any one of these, in fact I see it done even accidentally because film conventions form such narrow roads.But it seems difficult as getout to control it well enough that it emanates from a coherent world, to make a long form project that lives in the inventiveness rather than just sees it from time to time. Much of this is credited to the filmmaker, and how he can focus his team. Since there is very little motion capture, the effects did not have to be planned in advance and I imagine there was a lot of tinkering.Some of the credit has to go to the source, which I understand is a comic. I have not seen it but I imagine the overall shape was set and refined there.But we have to give the key actor credit too. He has to understand the cosmology of the thing well enough to convincingly inhabit it. This is a difficult acting challenge. Remember Bill Murray? It was his gift I believe to anticipate the finished tone of the film and place himself square within it. ""Groundhog Day"" depended on us seeing that it made sense to him.I have to admit to a generational deficiency that made this even better for me. The girls were unattractive, excepting the redhead drummer who is shunted to buddy status. They were emotionally damaged, intellectual nitwits and not physically desirable. In the story of course, they are all a guy lives for, literally. I am imagining that it made sense to the young audience that these trivial beings mattered. But for me, it increased the weirdness and otherworldliness of the thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Visually great and innovative but boring as overall entertainment...,"Is this movie overrated? Hell Yeah (Kbowww). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World follows the story of ... Scott (Michael Cera), a typical nerd that lacks presence in society and doesn't know how to really connect with people. After a break-up (here's the cliché) he falls under a rock and has a hard time finding himself. Being part of a band he tries to gain success and with that probably the notoriety and his personal revenge on his own frustrations. Things get complicated when he meets this girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) which is a hippie copy-cat of Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, at least that's who she reminded me of. ""Of course"" in order for Scott to get more dates from her he needs to defeat the League of Ex-es which contains all her 7 (seven) ex-es. The story is pretty much you know, the typical clicheic, nerdy type of storytelling, which really gets me bored at times. Some scenes succeed to be funny but many of them just fail. The dialogue is pretty good but I just felt it dragged on nothing at times. Some lines were there just to add a couple of useless minutes. What I found attractive in this movie was the editing and the visual effects which were amazing done. Obviously a lot of passion had been put in the visual aspect of this movie and all this gaming influences really did work on me and for that I will not bash this movie as being a failure but there's nothing there, not even the visuals, that could handle the important gasps in the script.Besides the dully and cheesy narrative aspect of the movie, the casting of Michael Cera was kind of obvious since he's the guy that always gets chosen to play the nerd/virgin guy and I did not got thrilled about it. You know why? Because I'm tired of Cera being the same guy in every movie. It's just boring to me and I don't get all the hype behind this Cera guy. He only portrays the same character over and over again. Few movies that I have watched had a slight different Cera but in 90% of them he's just the same and that to me is boring and old. Nothing new or fresh to keep me interested in him as an actor. If this would have been one of Cera's first movies then I would have probably liked his impersonation but since it's not... I just felt I was being cheated. Everything else was on point but just above average...The technical aspect was I think the best part of this movie. Cinematography, editing and visual effects, all, were handled well and delivered a bad story in a great way and for that you must give credit for the passion they've put in the visual style of the movie. With all that though I don't recommend Scott Pilgrim vs. The World as a good movie because to me it isn't... It's just a movie you could see if you're a Cera fan or you didn't saw too many Cera movies... It's not that much fun neither interesting enough... People who compare this to Kick-Ass make me laugh but then again... it's just my personal opinion... This is just a visually great and innovative but boring as overall entertainment...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim delivers!,"After seeing an advance screening of the film tonight, Scott Pilgrim is definitely one of the funniest movies of 2010 and one of the most exciting. Being a huge fan of the series, I was excited to see how it turned out and I was not disappointed. Michael Cera plays the role of Scott Pilgrim perfectly as does every actor in the film. The only flaw is that anyone who is unfamiliar with video game and comic culture may not enjoy the film as much as those who are familiar.

"Fiery show, a bit thin in plot, but enjoyable nonetheless","The sheer exuberance of Scott Pilgrim Vs the World takes about twenty minutes to get used to, but afterward, it's fun....not quite great, but fun (no question)This is a motion picture that relies almost entirely on the integrity of the post-production departments (Editing, sound, special FX). With all the fast cuts, split-screens, animated sound waves/valentines/lighting fight captions in a dozen fonts, and more Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a feast for the eyes and ears. It expresses a love for Music, Video Games and comic books alike. It is a spectacle that almost overwhelms story, which one could argue is the films Achilles heel. The plot line is a bit too satirical for it's own good. Most of it is played for laughs but when it does try to be serious, it feels like a derivative, half-fleshed teen romance (guy gets girl, looses girl, gets her back)Being Toronto-born and bred, I had the pleasure of witnessing the crew shoot on four separate occasions. Not many movies are set in Toronto, but Scott Pilgrim is proud to do so, and is even written into the script. I wont argue that the movie sells the city in its full beauty, but it is funny to see a hundred million dollar motion picture working out of the library when you went as a kid.times change fast, but maybe not as fast as the rhythm of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

Sh*t Sandwich,"Michael Cera is the same character in every movie. The guy lacks ANY personality whatsoever. If he's pi s s ed off, in love, indifferent, can you tell?

I don't understand how she could have 7 ex-boyfriends period, let alone powerful and evil ones.

I'm not quite sure what to make of it but I had fun!,"Slacker Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winsted). However, to get her, he must battle and defeat her 7 exes.I expected the worst when I saw how this was advertised (An Epic of Epic Epicness) but I had a free pass so I thought ""What the hell?"" I was surprised (actually kind of shocked) to find myself enjoying it. I'm not the target audience for this (I'm in my 40s and most of the kids in the theatre were in their 20s) but I still enjoyed myself. It's bursting with ideas, jokes, action...you name it. There are constant times that little words or phases pop up on the screen to tell us things...but they'll all funny and had me laughing. For example: at one point somebody says ""You don't think I know what that means?"" and the words ""He doesn't"" appear next to him. Also there are plenty of fight sequences but they're non-bloody and go so far over the top that you can't take them seriously. Also when people are killed they dissolve into coins! I know that's obviously pointing towards video games--in fact a LOT of this plays like a video game! When Cera kills somebody points appear on the screen and when he goes off to face the final and 7th ex ""Level 7"" pops up. Also Cera has a gay roommate (played to the hilt by Kieran Culkin) who is shown in a positive way and even has a fairly hot guy on guy kiss. He also sleeps in the same bed as Cera and WITH his boyfriend.The acting is good across the board. I never really liked Cera but he's perfectly cast here. Winsted is charming as Flowers. All her exes are well acted but my favorite had to be Brandon (Superman) Routh with blond hair as a mighty vegan. So I'm not quite sure what the point is here (if in fact there IS one) but I was never bored and found myself laughing quite a bit. I give it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Good - would watch it again sometime.,"This movie is a little difficult to categorize. It's part comedy/romance (ie chick flick) and part fantasy/spoof. The premise is somewhat far fetched in that the hero has to battle and defeat the heroine's past seven exes in order to win her heart. And the stars are not exactly well known, except for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and possibly Michael Cera. And there are a variety of characters here. Besides the hero and the heroine, there are the gay friend (well played by Kieran Culkin) and his friends, the band members, the girl friend (Ellen Wong), and the ex-girl friend.It's use of goofy, spoofy, textual, animated, and pseudo-video game special effects contributes to make it a movie you will either like or diss. I come down on the side of like partly because this is a film where the average guy (Cera) gets the hot girl. And by average guy I mean a really scrawny one who nevertheless seems to possess ninja-like close combat skills. And by hot girl I mean either Wong or the one with purple, blue, then green hair (Winstead).To say this movie is a little quirky would be understating it. To say it is a good, above average, movie is not an overstatement. Quirky or not, the actors give performances that are genuine. They are believable even in their rather unlikely and artificial surroundings. Cera in particular comes across as open, honest, and unassuming. A person who is emotionally defenseless; who does not want to wear a mask, but wants someone to accept him as he is, with all of his faults. And an honorable mention goes to Alison Pill who plays the dead pan, straight faced Kim, the band's drummer and another ex-girl friend. Her performance reminds me very much of Christina Ricci's Wednesday Adams.This movie is definitely not for everyone. But if you can give way to the bizarre physical reality and instead focus on the emotional, this is a movie you will enjoy and watch again sometime.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

On the Journey Style Rules,"In life it is all about the journey. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is about the journey, and then some. Director and Writer Edgar Wright creates a visually exciting approximation of life in this slacker gamer world where Michael Cera is avatar Scott Pilgrim. The screenplay by Wright and Michael Bacall is based on the graphic novel by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Being neither familiar with the source material, nor the twenty-something gamer demographic ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" occurs as a familiar Disneyland ride jacked on ecstasy and steroids. Wright creates TV homage from the campy 1960's ""Batman"" with ""Pow!"" to the more contemporary ""Seinfeld"". Wright generates one of the most visually inventive movies—though not along the lines of Chris Nolan's ""Inception"". However, here style over substance is not necessarily a good thing.""Scott Pilgrim"" is a video game fable with our hero Scott played by Michael Cera at his dweebish best. Scott is the 22 year-old slacker bass player for his band Sex Bo-bomb. He lives with his charming gay roommate Wallace (funny Kieran Culkin). He is rebounding from a break up with his rock siren girlfriend Envy Adams (devilish diva Brie Larson). He is dating 17 year-old high school girl Knives Chau (bubbly Ellen Wong). In the midst of a band competition for a record contract, Scott sees the girl of his dreams in his dreams—Ramona Flowers (fiery and beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Later Scott sees Ramona at a party, and realizes that she is the One. However, before Scott can date or make out with Ramona he must defeat, as in to the death, her 7 Evil Ex's. Note there is a reason why it is not the 7 Evil Ex-Boyfriends. Do the math. Needless to say, both high jinx and chaos ensue.Michael Cera is still playing the same freaking character—as he does in all his movies. However, here the good hearted nerd gets to kick ass in martial arts style. The saving grace is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona. Winstead has a self aware charm, and stunning screen presence. She is going to be a star. Chris Evans as egomaniac action star/ skateboarder Lucas Lee, also an Evil Ex, is hysterical. Jason Schwartzman is funny in small doses, but is light years beyond annoying as record producer Gideon Gordon Graves—also a Ramona Ex.""Scott Pilgrim"" is an eclectic narrative kluge. The fact that 22 year-old Scott is dating 17 year-old minor Knives, even if they aren't having sex, is very creepy. What is creepier, the screenwriters proceed as business as usual here. Perhaps, statutory rape laws are different in Toronto? The kung fu fight choreography is flashy and comical—the intended effect. Being a martial arts snob, I enjoyed the fight choreography of ""The Expendables"" way more.""Scott Pilgrim"" runs about 20 minutes too long, with about 3 too many Ex's, but fortunately ends right. Beneath all the pop culture glitz and indulgent idiosyncrasy ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is romantic comedy after all. Romantic comedy is hard to do.

Extremely flash,"Few films have filled me with equal amounts of anticipation and dread as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. The anticipation came from the marriage of an intriguing premise and a director that had shown immense promise through having a hand in some of the best comedy of the past 10 years. On the other hand, the over-the-top style and hipper-than-thou vibes looked to be a double-edged sword that could bring the whole thing crashing down in bright computer-generated flames.Let's get the plot out of the way - for those who haven't heard anything at all about this, the titular character is an unemployed musician living in Toronto who ends up meeting the girl of his dreams one night. As he gets involved with her, he discovers that she has a hell of a past - she's left behind ""seven evil exes"". For no adequately explained (or particularly necessary) reason, they each come after Scott and engage him in ludicrously over-the-top battles. In between fights, Scott still has to deal with the various ups and downs of his relationship and how it affects the rest of his life.Right, let's move on the film proper - well, those feelings I mentioned in the first paragraph? By and large justified in both respects. On the good side, stylistically the film is sublime. Despite having never read the source comics, I still enjoyed the film's heavy-handed usage of comic-book conventions such as visible sound effects, split-screen panels...the works. That's going without mentioning the copious references to videogames, whether it's the subtle use of sounds from other games or the blatant references to such things as getting lives or winning points. The visual effects are also top-notch, going above and beyond expectations with colourful clashes and blistering battles. If nothing else, Scott Pilgrim looks a million dollars.Now comes the bit where I follow up a paragraph full of earnest praise with a little bit of honest criticism...while the film is great visually, I'm not really a fan of everything else about the film. Michael Cera does his usual ""awkward goofiness"" schtick, while most of the other cast deliver undemanding deadpan performances. On the other hand, the hamminess of the exes comes close to making up for it it.While I don't deny that these different styles genuinely fit in the right sequences, sometimes it gels and sometimes it doesn't. The same goes for some of the references that the film tries to jam in, especially one scene that parodies a certain popular sitcom that really isn't quite as funny as it should be. I could probably rattle off a list of the stuff that falls flat, but I'd probably have to list the stuff that didn't as well, so the non-action sequences are something of a mixed bag for myself.If you're familiar with any of Wright's other work, this will definitely amuse you to one degree or another. If you're not, well, I daresay all the promotional materials give you the right idea - it's a fairly lightweight romantic comedy plot wrapped in a few layers of unbelievable fantasy and cooked to a crisp. Ultimately it suffers from one very extreme case of style over substance, but what a style it is. Definitely worth seeing in theatres, if nowhere else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Game On"" Before ""Love On""","It's sometimes career suicide when making a film based on already produced, cult-adored material because the material (TV show, comic book, video game) has a rabid fanbase.

Keep up, people!No doubt Michael Cera (""Arrested Development"", Superbad"", ""Juno"") is geek-familiar in the title role, a twentysomething, struggling indie rocker in Toronto who either jams with his buds Stephen (Mark Webber), Kim (Allison Pill of ""Milk"") and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons of ""Jennifer's Body), hangs with his sharkish gay roommate Wallace (sly Kiernan Culkin of ""Lymelife"") or avoids the great buzz surrounding his ex-girl/rocker Envy Adams (Brie Larson of ""The United States of Tara"").Barely legal high schooler Knives Chau (lively Ellen Wong) captures Scott's heart, but the relationship's deader than a corpse. Enter bright-haired, American immigrant and Amazon delivery girl on rollerblades Ramona Flowers (cute, deadpan Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Live Free Or Die Hard"") in the pictures, and it's ""Knives Who?"" in Scott's head. Ramona returns his ""love jones"" but her seven ex-lovers (two are twins and one's a girl!) show up, mean and super-powered, forcing our hero into wild anime/video game duels, complicating his already shaky love life.If you understand the visual languages of anime, American and Japanese comic book, video games and indie rock, which are jam-packed in the script by Wright and Michael Bacall (co-wrote/starred in ""Manic""), good for you because the average moviegoer would get a brain aneurysm. The co-writers know all the fringe pop culture storytelling tricks and hugs them: speed lines during battles; side commentary; captions introducing characters and locales, illustrating audio effects (a la the 1960s ""Batman"" TV series) and noting life points; limbo-like dreams; characters changing hairstyles and costumes; facial wild takes and enemies turning into coins after defeat. It's an assault on the eyes and ears, but film begs and deserves multiple viewings, especially on DVD.Nobody has a gray hair, sagging chin or an AARP membership card in the cast, but they have old souls, especially the two leads. Cera may be a typecast victim, but his role has a backbone, attracting Winstead's dour but colorful heart. The aforementioned supporting players are damn good gonzo; no cast of a TV teen drama could defeat them! Even the ""sane"" ones, popinjay-like, steel-eyed clerk Julie Powers (Aubrey Plaza of ""Parks and Recreation"") and Scott's hard-fact older sib Stacey (Anna Kendrick of ""Up In The Air"") fit in the madness. Bill Hader (also of ""Superbad"") is interesting the unseen voice.You also can't forget The League of Evil-Exes, a bunch of self-loving nut-jobs, Scott must handle one by one. Standouts include Chris Evans (who's been in a lot of comic book cine-adaptations since 2005) as a cocky action movie star; Brandon Routh (""Superman Returns"" and a unfairly controversial-by-fan guest run on the geek spy series ""Chuck"") as a strict vegan guitarist/ Envy's current beau; Mae Whitman as a feisty lesbian with a metal whip and Jason Schwartzman (""Rushmore"", ""Bored To Death"") as a slimy music industry power broker/the gang's leader.Like ""Sin City"", ""Watchmen (The Ulitmate Cut)"" and ""Kick-Ass"", ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" is another true-blue cine-adaptation of a comic book/graphic novel that gives the finger to conformistic, maturity attitudes while being mature in the process. Not a lot of people will ""get it""(thanks ADD!!!), but give it time. Until ""Tron Legacy"", the film's probably the most video game-centric around. If they see this, hard-core gamers will refrain from drowning their sorrows in Yoo-Hoo, after being exposed to drek like ""Double Dragon"" and the ""Street Fighter"" films (not the Sonny Chiba films, mind you).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Soon to be forgotten,"I am reviewing this title because I want to ply devil's advocate to the other reviews which give it such high praise. Have you ever seen a movie (like a bad 80's film) and thought ""Wow, that's so out of date"". Well in four years, you will look back on Scott Pilgrim and probably say something like it. The movie is so rooted in the now, that it in my opinion will not fare well next to classic pieces of cinema. Now, do not get me wrong, it was entertaining but it lacked depth and staying power in my opinion. I see it as gimmicky and all too flashy. When the smoke clears I think it will be a kitschy movie at best. So, if you want to spend some time watching pretty flashy colors and laughing at cute video game jokes, rent or buy this movie. Looking for an experience? Grab a copy of Big Trouble in Little China or an Indiana Jones movie or heck, Lawrence of Arabia. Sorry for the negativity but I got to add my two cents.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Audiences: No Clue (what they're missing) → Edgar Wright: Gets It,"It is always truly delightful to see a major motion picture take a real chance, blending a daringly new angle into a familiar template and culminating in a doubly enjoyable final product. Director Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is such a triumph, undertaking a cocktail of manic energy and charm, dazzling visuals, unassumingly quirky humour, while still boasting an unmistakable (albeit pixilated) heart. Nonetheless, the film's poor box office suggests that many audiences and/or distributors are finding the idea of the film alienating (too nerdy? Too stylized? Too young and hip? Too Canadian?). However, at the risk of being excessively blunt, such concerns are largely unwarranted and, for the most part, missing the point. For while Scott Pilgrim may seemingly the tailor made film for those old enough to remember classic Zelda yet young enough to still have played it, the film's true genius lies in its fundamental accessibility, hitting all the right notes to delight fans of Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novels without alienating those unfamiliar with any variety of geekdom.While video game and comic book adaptations have become quite common multiplex fare of late, there is still something that feels so fundamentally unique and crisp about a film set in a more overt overlap between 'reality' and the physics and credulity bending of the aforementioned media. Even just by considering how much astronomical thought and care were invested into the minutiae of the production (the film opens with an 8-bit, classic video game style Universal logo, and throwaway references to any number of cultural texts abound – watch for 'Launchpad McQuack'), the film boasts such a determined earnestness that it is nigh impossible not to love. Wright, expanding upon the same wild yet harnessed hilarity he exercised in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, strikes a perfect tone and pace, with quick cutting, hip dialogue and a potentially disjointed and episodic story flowing without a single stumble or hitch. Equally, the whimsical visual effects (ranging from electric bolts dancing across the screen when Pilgrim's band, Sex Bob-Omb, play, to visual sound effects punctuating brutal Evil-Ex battles, to throwaway touches such as a ""pee bar"") never threaten to overwhelm the story.Yes, story. For, while the film may be an admittably hard sell (the protagonist must battle his love interest's Seven Evil Exes in wildly choreographed video game style fights to be with her? !), Scott Pilgrim is as far as can be from mere hyperactive, flashy cinematic noise. Instead, Wright continually draws the focus back to the emotional heart of the story, paradoxically seeking intrinsic realism through fantasy and achieving both the most and least believable film in ages. Tapping into the obsessions, neuroses and hang-ups of a lovelorn, confused, whiney, aimless, occasionally downright dislikeable yet always lovable 22 year old and vibrantly letting them loose on screen, Wright's film proves far more resonant and truthful than first glance would suggest. The film's set pieces, the battles with Ramona Flowers' evil exes, apart from being exhilarating blends of blinding choreography and visual trickery, ultimately prove cunningly symbolic vehicles for the characters' largely unresolved emotional conflicts being hashed out with the sort of gleeful violence any frustrated young adult is bound to want to wreak on their nearby environment. Between the stomping, hard rock score (much of it performed by the cast), Scott Pilgrim could prove one of the most cathartic movies ever.Also, on a personal note, it is rather heartwarming to see an unabashedly Canadian big budget action movie, for once set in Toronto and not 'Toronto posing as New York'.Nonetheless, all considered, it is the ensemble cast who truly elevate the film to its triumphant heights. Michael Cera, finally provided more nuance than his usual neurotic misfits, is perfectly cast as Scott Pilgrim, his nearly unmatchable comic timing and ability to bleed charm and charisma even at his most whiney, clueless and unsympathetic making Scott a supremely relatable and enjoyable emotional foil. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a remarkable job of humanizing her idolized Ramona Flowers, as every time Flowers appears too aloof and distant to truly take to, Winstead's eyes radiate a heartbreaking sense of empathy and self-regret, culminating in a beautifully understated yet effective performance. Similarly, Ellen Wong alternates between irresistibly adorable, hilariously obsessive and quietly tragic as Scott's scorned high school girlfriend Knives, the three forming an unorthodox yet perfectly pitched romantic triangle.As Pilgrim's 'supporting characters', Kieran Culkin just about steals the show as Scott's bemusedly detached gay roommate Wallace, Anna Kendrick chatters with comical scorn as his sister, and Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill are side-splitting as Pilgrim's meager yet impressive band (Pill, in particular, being graced with one of the most hilarious deadpans in cinema history). On the opposing team, each Evil-Ex in turn chomp the scenery with delicious aplomb, with standouts being Chris Evans' unforgettable Hollywood meathead, Brandon Routh as a snappy vegan with mystical powers, and Jason Schwartzman epitomizing sleaze as a smarmy record producer, though Satya Bhabha wins extra points for delivering one of the most unexpected song and dance numbers in recent memory as Flowers' vindictive first boyfriend.Apart from being effectively the most satisfying translation of O'Malley's graphic novels any fan could hope for, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World proves the film to beat in terms of fusing a bravely niche approach into good, old fashioned, accessible entertainment without ever sacrificing on edge, hilarity or even complexity and never compromised by its genre trappings. Near essential viewing and better on ever watch, Wright delivers a true KO of a film, if ever there was one.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim VS the very timid audience,"Scott Pilgrim reminded me as to why i love films, nowadays we have too much of the same being shoved down our throats. Thankfully this movie shoryuken's that out of theatre and from the 8 bit universal logo and music you are thrust into a sea of references memorable quotes and the most well shot and choreographed fight scenes in recent memory. Unfortuantly though many people will dismiss this movie and go see a unoriginal and gimmicky movie because it is the safer option. many people have said that the film is only appealing to one demographic. GOOD i would rather have a movie appeal to one group than to be a dreary grey appealathan for all.The film is Filled with references that you have fun just finding so if you are a fan of video games comic books anime manga or geek culture in general you oh it to yourself to watch this movie. with its great action scenes, funniest and quotable lines, BRUTAL soundtrack, likable characters and references to other media.

Fresh Take on Teen Films but Fails on Other Fronts,"I'll admit that I've never been neither much of a gamer nor an avid reader of comic books aka graphic novels. So, while I understood the gaming world references, there was little nostalgic value in the film for me personally and I had no idea about who Scott Pilgrim is.The movie is definitely an achievement in teen movie genre that faces some problems with identity in the 21st century, IMHO. Michael Cera will definitely make you laugh, he's probably one of those characters you start to laugh at already seeing for the first time in the movie, the jokes are not as funny as Cera's characteristic stupid face and mannerisms. And that's a big problem with this film. You find yourself laughing not about the jokes but about the movie itself. Now, there's nothing wrong with it as Wright obviously intended ""Scott Pilgrim"" to be a stab at stupid action movies and video game clichés, among other things, but the attempts at serious drama just get lost in this CGI and Kung Fu or whatever extravaganza...I remember ""Watchmen"" as I had a problem like this with that movie too. You might call it ""style over substance"" as nowadays, at least for me personally, ""Sin City"" like stylized comic book adaptations go far too over the top and it wouldn't be bad, it would be great if only they wouldn't try to attempt serious drama among all the CGI battles and explosions and Ddddddd's running on the street.""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"", as I said, is not a bad movie as it entertains and gives you a good time. But it's nothing more than that. It doesn't feel as revolutionary in the visual area as Avatar was and the plot, while it could work despite all the massive ""why?"" questions about everything on the screen (why is Scott sleeping in the same bed with a guy who's having gay threesome at the same time), is massacred by empty characters you cannot relate to and who either bore you or are utterly repulsive.It's not a bad movie- it brings new things to teen movie genre, like interesting and clever visuals and cool battle scenes, it entertains and is funny, even if drags a bit at the end. But it isn't particularly good film either, as it's inhabited by ""style over substance"" in all areas and over the top/ exaggerated characters you cannot and don't want to relate to. In this way it's similar to already mentioned ""Watchmen""",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Decent for fans, but awesome for newcomers!","*VERY LIGHT SPOILERS IN TERMS OF DESCRIBING SOME CHARACTERS AND JOKES*The Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series is one of my favorites of all time. What seems to be just another love story quickly unfolds into the epic saga of a twenty-something that would apparently do everything to continue the love of his life: Ramona Flowers.But this isn't about the comic! This is about Edgar Wright's interpretation of it. And knowing that he's the creator of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead (one of my favorite zombie movies ever), this couldn't go wrong for me. However, as a true fan of the franchise, I'm a bit disappointed at some points -- Wright seems to have completely reformed the book into what he thinks it should be, and for the most part this works exceedingly well, but sometimes, having read the book, you'll just scratch your head and wonder why he left THAT particular moment out, it being a significant moment in the book. So, as for implementing plot lines and key moments from the book in the movie, he does a pretty good job, although somewhat questionable for die-hards.However: visually, this movie is amazing. The comic book/video game vibe Edgar Wright gave this movie is incredibly fitting. From the crashes and booms in true comic book style to the 1-ups: this movie breathes geekiness, in the most glorious way imaginable. The acting is decent, and most characters re-catch their typical personality and feel they got from the boos, however, there is one major flaw in my opinion on that behalf: Scott Pilgrim, pictured as an unsure, but pretty awesome guy in the comics, turns into some awkward teeny fellow here: come on guys, Michael Cera is a decent actor, but he's NOT Scott Pilgrim!As for the jokes, it does what it does pretty well. Some of them are taken from the book, so they couldn't mess that up. Some of them are implemented by the makers though, and most of them are pretty funny (the other L-word!) but some of them are just weird and feel kind of forced to break the fourth wall (the censorship girl).Even though this movie has its flaws, I've had a great laugh with it -- and so will you, especially if you're a fan of the graphic novels and always wanted to see it on the white screen! If I had to describe this movie in one word, I'd call it ""light"", but give me two words, and it turns into ""... also awesome""!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Good enough,"Scot fells in love with Ramona, but he has to defeat her seven exes first before finally getting her. The movie has an odd way of showing things and the time line is so messed up, that it easily get from one scene to an entirely different one. But that, I think, was the best part of the movie. The film combines music, with comics and video games. There are graphics, even voices, coming from the graphic novels. Of course, after the first few scenes, you start to realize that this is not a non fiction movie, as exes with special powers start to appear. One thing that I didn't like was the cliché of the action scenes and maybe some parts of the story. But all in all, it was quite funny and entertaining, so 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A Crazy Fun Ride in the World of Scott Pilgrim!,"Man, oh man! Where do I even start with ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World""? This movie is like a roller coaster that's strapped to a rocket, filled with all the video game nostalgia and comic book goodness you could ever dream of!First of all, let's talk about the visuals. This film is an absolute treat for the eyes. The director, Edgar Wright, brings the graphic novel to life in such a vibrant and unique way, you'll feel like you're watching a video game and a comic book melded together. It's just like ""KAPOW!"" and ""BAM!"" right in your face, but in the best possible way!Now, the story. Michael Cera plays Scott Pilgrim, a somewhat awkward, nerdy guy who falls head over heels for Ramona Flowers, played by the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But there's a catch - to win her heart, Scott must defeat her seven evil exes. I mean, talk about relatable, right? (Okay, maybe not for everyone, but you get the idea.) The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and leans heavily into its over-the-top premise, which is honestly what makes it so darn fun!The cast is packed with talent, from Chris Evans as one of the evil exes to Kieran Culkin as Scott's snarky roommate. Everyone seems to be having a blast in their roles, and the energy is absolutely infectious. You'll find yourself rooting for Scott and his band, Sex Bob-Omb, as they rock their way through the challenges thrown at them.As for the soundtrack, it's simply fantastic. Featuring original music from the likes of Beck and Metric, the tunes perfectly complement the movie's frenetic energy and will have you bobbing your head and tapping your foot in no time.Sure, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who enjoy a wild, hilarious, and visually stunning ride, it's an absolute must-see.

"Love the Direction, can't stomach the lead","I have somewhat ambivalent feelings when it comes to this movie. I almost love it. I love what Edgar Wright did to make it feel comic-booky. All the effects, transitions, cuts, the whole style and vibe of the movie appeal to me. On the other hand, I find Michael Cera really very annoying. Yes, I used two adverbs, because I felt it was granted. An unattractive and annoying clingy dude that has all these beautiful women around him seems somewhat unrelatable and unrealistic to me. His ex, his platonic GF and the girl he is chasing all seem out of his league to me. I find the protagonist utterly unrelatable and unlikeable which is a detriment to my enjoyment of the movie. Yet I watch it every now and then in spite of him. That just goes to show, how much I enjoy the rest of it. The choreography, the music, the overall style are all fun and good.

Modern-day Love Story Will Conquer Your Heart,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, based off the excellent graphic novel series is a spot-on roller-coaster of flash AND substance for fans of video games, the Scott Pilgrim comics or strip culture as a whole alike. The story of Scott Pilgrim's struggle for glory fighting his new girlfriend's seven evil ex-boyfriends to continue dating her doesn't have much going for it per se, but Scott's charming character, growing increasingly confident throughout the movie saves the movie story wise, as you really care for him. What's left is flashy, comic-book/video-game style action: if 1-up's and grotesque ""POW"" sound effects and a sick garage rock OST sound like your cup of tea, the whole movie will probably be worth its while for you, if not, don't even bother.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Boring and extremely disappointing,"I like / love Edgar Wright's other movies (""Shaun..."" is easily one of the 10 best British films ever made and is endlessly quotable, and ""Fuzz"" so perfectly captures the vein of the genre it affectionately spoofs) as well as his TV show ""Spaced"" (final scene of first series filmed in my local!), so I was looking forward to this a lot; unfortunately I was really really disappointed.I found the film flaccid (at least 30 mins too long) the characters unengaging and uninteresting, the drama non-existent (was there ever any doubt how it would turn out?) and most frustratingly of all just not funny enough. It was just boring.Yes, I can see that all the video game stuff is clever, and the Flash Gordon reference was fun, but being clever is not enough to make a film good and I found it pretty annoying before too long.I am not familiar with the source material but if this is faithful to it I can only conclude that it wasn't worth being turned into a movie. No-one ever made a good movie from lousy source material.I am in my mid 30s so possibly older than the target audience, but I'm still astounded this rates so highly and is in the top 250 (at time of writing).

Just can't get enough,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a movie based on comic book series that takes place in a video game world. This world is the imaginary wonderland of Toronto, Canada. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22 year old bassist for his garage band, Sex Bob-Omb. He's a simple minded and laid back kid without a whole lot on his mind. That is until he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He immediately falls head over heels for her, as she is (figurativley and literally) the girl of his dreams. However, as soon as he starts dating her, he learns that this love comes with a price. In order to date her he must defeat her seven evil exes. And so the fun begins, treating the audience to an outrageous and hilarious ride.From the get-go we learn that Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not a serious movie, yet its not a joke movie. The gags in this film are used so artistically and so creatively that every moment will have you smiling at the hysterical new reality created within this fantastic film. The director of this film is the British genius Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). The entire movie is ripe with Wright's trademarks and does not at all lack the blend stylistic and comedic brilliance seen in his other films, even with the absence of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has a very specific style to it, and even after almost two hours of it, it never gets old. The movie never loses focus on what it is and stays at the same level of quirk and charm the whole way through.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is based off of a comic series written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. I wasn't familiar with the comics at all, and there were points in the film where I thought it may have been funnier if I had read the comic, but overall it does a fantastic job of not alienating people like me. Instead of being a panel by panel adaptation of the comic, it creates its own style that anyone with a broad sense of humor should be able to enjoy. It is so rare that a comedy is released these days that brings something new to the table. Scott Pilgrim finally breaks this trend and delivers on all levels and absolutely amazes. It's also not often that I never want a film to end while watching it. Scott Pilgrim broke this trend as well. I was so transfixed and entertained by this stunning piece of satirical art that I couldn't get enough. There wasn't a single moment where I thought the film lagged or lost touch with me, and that level of consistency is something you don't see enough of today.Scott Pilgrim is an excellent blend of everything you could want from film this day and age. Its fun and entertaining, while also being meaningful and captivating. It interweaves hilarious jokes, played up in all sorts of fashions ranging from sight gags to social commentary, into an actual story rich with character development and a plot that excites and entertains in its own way. The story is also a great blend of being action driven as well as character driven. There is quite a wide array of characters in this film. The cast is really an ensemble led with full force by Micael Cera. Each character has some odd and funny quirk to them, always leaving you wondering what they could do next. I know I'll be coming back to this film many more times, not only for the entertainment value, but also the great and relevant story it tells in the midst of hilarity and absurdity.Visually fantastic, and all the while attention grabbing and imaginatively grand, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a must see for this summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Unexpectedly good and inexplicably funny,"All i knew about this film prior to watching it is that he has Michael Cera doing the main role. It may mean nothing to some, but those who had seen movies starring Cera before might get a clue or two. And i don't mean it strictly in a good way.Actually, since i first saw Michael in Superbad, he had one stable trait about his characters... they are all the same. Literally. He's always this kinda shy and awkward, nerdy but at the same time sorta streetwise type of guy of undefinable age, the one you wouldn't hate straight away but who you still wouldn't envy even if he got the hottest babe in the show. And if we add his constant grimace of a puppy who just sh@t himself a moment ago and is all sorry about that, i would expect his puppy charms to wear off rather quickly and the frustration to take over.But at the same time, no matter how single-dimensional Michael's characters are, this ""i'm shy and gentle"" trick almost never fails to work. It definitely worked in Superbad, where Michael Cera and Jonah Hill duet played some Kyle&Eric sort of magic which, with help of other characters like legendary McLovin, made the film equally fun, deep and touching. In Juno, it was Ellen Page's turn to fill Cartman's place, which she did brilliantly, which also added to the film's overall success.Here, in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there's no single teammate whom Michael Cera's character of a guy with a complicated approach to relationships could play along. Instead, there's a whole bunch of friends, foes and love interests who swirl around him in a sick (in a good way) mix of garage rock, 8-bit games and comic book extravaganza. Which means, this time Michael has to prove that he can be a single locomotive for the big show.The first 15 minutes of the film weren't too reassuring on this account. They are without a doubt visually creative, and this is probably the first time after Sin City that style does not only overcome substance but becomes a source of it. Yet, the character of Scott Pilgrim itself is what looks like a main drawback. I mean, our guy is still cute and naive, but there's something missing, some driving force that could turn that series of awkward and silly moments into something substantial.And then the miracle happens. Once we finally get to know Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character of a femme who's literally fatale, the story gets a major kick up the butt, and apparently Scott's personality too, because he starts demonstrating will, determination and skills we never got to expect from Michael Cera's fragile and semi-vegetative characters. Can't say this transformation looks very natural, but naturality is the last thing one should expect from a movie that looks more a comic book than a typical cinema.Maybe this visual surrealism is the main defining point of Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Because what might otherwise be somewhat bland and boring transforms into a unique sort of fun, something i never had a chance to experience since Kick-Ass and The Green Hornet, which was years ago for me. The action scenes are equally intense and bizarre, which makes them all the more unpredictable and satisfying.Yet there's more to this film than just the action, visuals and the raw energetics of the whole performance. There's this trademark Canadian approach to life that this movie teems with: from the little comedic episodes, sketches and phrases to the characters to the whole entourage. Not as self-absorbed as the typical American everything, more willing to have a joke on itself, maybe even insecure in some ways, but still with enough soul to incur rather sympathy than abasement. As if the film plays its strengths and weaknesses open but relies on your good will to expect forgiveness rather than judgement.This is the main message this movie sends us by its ending. That whoever we are and whatever we've done, the most important thing is to be able to accept ourselves and those who surround you. Not that big of a philosophical breakthrough, but still satisfying enough to leave a generally pleasant aftertaste. The same could be said about the movie as a whole. Very solid, with both the unique sides and the touching moments. Maybe not breaking enough rules nor touching enough sore spots to really stand out as a film to be remembered across generations. But aiming for that would be too pompous and pretentious, which isn't how they do things in Canada. After all, there's nothing wrong with just good ol' entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Original yet silly,"Wild, fun, original, and yet deeply silly, verging on the vacuous.Michael Cera offers a solid performance creating the truly pathetic eponymous protagonist, Scott Pilgrim. However, throughout the film, we see Scott's heroic side, where his video-game-like self is able to battle his enemies. The film yo-yos between these personas, until we reach the end, wondering what this misguided ode to video games was trying to achieve. While the film does seem to lose the plot, it is at least buttressed by good music, feel good vibes, and a talented cast.Edgar Wright certainly cooked up something new, but I'm not convinced it's a winning recipe.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Too imaginative, too funny","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is the bass player for the aspiring rock band Sex Bob-omb. He's not a lady killer but one day Scott meets the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Instead of a typical dating ritual, Scott is plagued with challenges by Ramona's seven evil exes. Despite his lackluster physique, Scott can go toe to toe with most of them in hand to hand combat. When that fails he turns to the powers of his noggin or guitar.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most video game-esquire movie I've ever seen. There are stats, one-ups, power-ups. Coins even appear when a foe is dispatched, suggesting that the audience/player continue the movie/game. These are all referential gags that build a fantasy atmosphere and make it difficult to question the feasibility of plot. Just about anything can happen, and when it did I was able to accept it.There seems to be no bounds to the inspiration that can be drawn from underground geek subculture. Most of the film has effects that bring to life the popular formats of manga, anime, and video game staples, but out of nowhere sounds and laugh tracks are lifted from Seinfeld of all places. It's not for the sake of being silly, everything adds to the style and tone of this fantasy/romantic comedy. Each battle is unique. Some elements carryover (the outlandish style of hit anime series Dragon Ball and video game inspired points system) but Scott is always able to apply a new approach for success, resulting in the frail Pilgrim outsmarting some of his tougher foes. Sometimes he's able to turn their egos against them, but my favorite outcome came when he tricked psychic vegan Todd (Brandon Routh) resulting in the appearance of the fabled vegan police.Michael Cera is famous for his typecasting as a soft-spoken slacker. Here he brings the usual to the table, trying to play the everyman while chaos erupts around him. But I suppose not every man is able to leap into the air to deliver a punch or survive being thrown into a castle. It's a far cry from the comedic action found in other works of director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead); trading blood for lens flare and superhuman durability, it's a friendly but intense PG-13.The outlandishness doesn't end there. Every secondary character has a clearly defined role and personality. There are many and each is memorable. Among my favorites is Wallace (Kieran Culkin) who periodically states the obvious. He'll interrupt a fight to inform Scott that he's fighting someone. Drummer Kim (Alison Pill) is low in lines but with each her cynical delivery garners a laugh. Lastly, newcomer Ellen Wong brings a comedic, expressive sensibility to Knives Chau, Sex Bob-omb's biggest fan.Its strength is a minor weakness. There isn't broad appeal to be found in the in-jokes and should you understand the point of reference you may find yourself laughing over another punch line—like a gamer, an audience member must be well coordinated.I would not be surprised in the least if Scott Pilgrim vs. the World endures in popular conversation for years to come. It's a generational film that will be looked back upon with all the nostalgia of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is too imaginative to be farce, and too funny to be forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scott Pilgrim VS my review...,"Scott Pilgrim VS The World, based off the Oni Press graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley, has had a mix of opinions. Some people love it; however, other people completely hate it. When I first watched it, I didn't view it with a critical mind, so my verdict on it was that it was awesome. Having watched it again with a critical mind, I'm starting to think: Was it really that awesome?The graphic novels were great, but the 6 books had so much in them, character wise and story wise that seemed way too much to pack into one film. But, with the bad points in the film, it has its up sides. Edgar Wright did a great job at staying true to the source material. A lot of the scenes in the movie looked just like they did in the books, and the comic effects that came on screen made us feel like we were watching a moving graphic novel. The casting also helped a lot also, as most all the actors looked very similar to the comic's characters. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winsted defiantly suited the roles, especially Jason Schwartzman, who made a great Gideon. Another good thing was that it had the same quirky humour that the books had, and I found myself laughing at what was funny in the graphic novels. But the films flaws are what brings it down from being as good as the books. The thing with the 6 books was, it had A lot going on. There's a lot of characters' that have their own back-stories, ranging from the evil ex-boyfriends to Scott's fellow band members and friends, and I felt that pretty much none of them were explored enough in this film.The whole back story between Scott and Kim was briefly mentioned but not fully explored; the Envy Adams story was also brought up, but only left us asking what happened between them in the first place? The ex boyfriends had very little screen time each, and although that is the case in the books, at least the books explained a little more about them. Mathew Patel had his story explained, but then we are given the same cheesy singing scene that was one of the first books low points. The Twins were completely wasted due to neither of them having any lines to say, and there was no real confrontation between Ramona and Todd and how Todd is, basically, a cheating scumbag.The relationship between Scott and Ramona didn't work at all. It took 6 books to develop the love story and the conflicts between them, but, like a lot of other factors in this film, that part seemed rushed through also. Ramona had the same habit she had in the books, she was quite the confusing character whose personality goes from annoying to very annoying after some time. I didn't buy the romance between Scott and Ramona either, and even towards the end when it's all over, I still don't see how they manage to make the relationship work together. Everything seemed to be summed up within a few minutes that leaves us asking things like: ""Wait, what happened between those two?"" or ""Well that got summed up a bit quick"" or even ""They have TOTALLY missed that part out!"". Understandable, movies can go down a different route from their source material, but this movie tried to fit everything in that resulted in it being quite a mess of a film. And Ramona had the same habit she had in the books: She was quite the confusing character whose personality go very annoying after some time.Whereas the films CGI was often quite decent, some fighting scenes were a little glitchy. I'm not too sure if that was their intention to make fight scenes glitchy like a video game, but I don't think the whole video game effect appealed to me. Another thing that I'm unsure of is, are these characters' actually in a video game? The lives, the fighting and the sound effects, is it set in the real world or an actual video game world? Whereas in the books Bryan managed to get away with it, for a film it doesn't work all that well.The verdict is, Scott Pilgrim VS the World is an enjoyable film if you don't pay too much attention to details. However if its details and a proper structured story you are after, I doubt that you will enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The Box Office does NOT Show How Good A Movie Is,"Why is it that so many good movies have low box office? Maybe it's my love of the comics, but this movie was great.

"Good, but could have been *so* good.","This is a difficult film to rate.Stylistically, it is stunningly imaginative and bold. The renditions of magical realism are some of the best, the aesthetic beauty of which simply cannot be put into words. It is worth a look on this alone.On the other hand, the film also suffers from problems. It comes down to doing too much in too little space and losing metaphorical coherence. By the middle of the second act, it is no longer clear which parts of the film are to be understood literally but farcically, and which purely metaphorically, and that detracts from the central redemptive message.The story itself is simple, in a way that all universal and human stories are at their core, so it truly has great potential. However, in the film it is rushed into the third and final act without producing a full punch despite a great deal of action. The long middle act is again the downfall. It inexplicably explores the external manifestation of conflict in near exclusion to the internal conflict. Or perhaps it puts too much burden on the viewer to infer deeper (and anyways strained) allegories. As a result, what could have been a transformative film is saddled with an emotional and philosophical content only shallowly elicited. This is unfortunate and even unfair, but it is the only way to explain this unsated feeling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Looks great on Edgar Wright's CV,"The interestingly-titled 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' is based on a comic book about a young man who has to fight his new girlfriend's seven evil ex boyfriends. No, seriously. And, if the first question you're asking is ""Why?"" then you're probably like me. First of all this is a movie (probably!) more for teenagers and youngsters (not bitter and cynical forty-somethings such as myself), therefore I'm guessing that most people will just go with it, rather than questioning every single plot point like I found myself doing.
I did enjoy the film - sort of. Once you allow yourself to get past just how ludicrous the plot is, you'll find that it is in fact quite funny. The titular Scott Pllgrim, played by the totally typecast Michael Cera, falls in love with a new girl in his town, only to discover that, in order to win her heart, he has to beat and pummel all her 'evil' exes one after another. And it's quite fun to watch, possibly because it knows how daft it is and therefore plays on it, deciding to shoot the film almost like a computer game from yesteryear. Expect 'life gauges' to appear on screen every time Scott picks a fight with someone new. Plus plenty of visual comic-like clues as to the fact that it wants you to know that it's based on a comic book, such as written text on the screen to emphasise sounds and feelings.
I'd probably forget the film quite quickly if it wasn't for the fact that it's co-written and directed by Edgar Wright, best known for working with Simon Pegg on various film collaborations. I think it's fair to say that Wright has a visual style that really works with this type of film. Every scene he emphasises silly little things in order to draw your attention to little details that most films overlook. I found myself enjoying how the film looked even more than the actual film itself. Sorry for the generalisation, but I do think that younger cinema audiences will enjoy the story aspect, however it was funny enough to keep me entertained and had a visual flair that is often missing from mainstream Hollywood. Just a pity Edgar Wright never got to do his vision of Marvel's 'Antman!'
If nothing else, it's worth watching Captain 'Chris Evans' America take the beating that even Iron Man himself couldn't manage!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What an amazing movie,"Edgar Wright does it again with another banger and I honestly don't know why I haven't watched this movie till now, but I'm glad I did because it's one of the craziest, sometimes funniest and most stylish movies I've ever seen. And the editing is just amazing. At the beginning it was kinda weird but as the movie progresses through and you get what you're dealing with, it becomes one of the most fun movies you'll ever seen. And the fight scenes are pretty great. The fight scenes kinda reminded me of Legion the tv show, that show is also very creative and cool like this and might even inspired from this movie. All in all a great movie don't miss it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
the must see movie for comic book video game players,"So I watched Scott Pilgrim vs. the World from 2010. This falls under the indy movie category for me, so was it good I say yes. I am getting older (not old yet) and though I have a wii, I am not video game dude nor am I a comic book junkie. However, this movie had great acting, an interesting premise, was well done and extremely creative, and very enjoyable from start to finish. My one complaint is sometimes it was a little too much. What that means exactly is it moved like a video game, fast and with constant activity and no time to breath. But then again that may be the point, but then again this is a movie, not a video game. This is a movie for hipsters,video game freaks, and comic book guys (and gals). The fight sequences are very refreshing and there is both great humor and several good love stories. This movie seems very youth oriented, but as I said I am not as young as I once was and am no longer this movies key demographic, and I had a blast watching it.

Scott Pilgrim Vs My Attention Span,"Let's cut to the chase. This movie is woefully bad in almost every single aspect. The characters are vague, irritating, two-dimensional non-entities, and as such, I found it impossible to relate to any of them. In particular, Scott Pilgrim is a dull, whiny brat with no personality whatsoever. The rest of the ensemble are cardboard cut-outs aimed at an audience that must surely prize pre-teen rambling over actual conversation, and you'll be hard pushed to remember anything interesting that any one of them said after the movie.The plot is insulting - boy must beat girl's evil ex's to win her. That's it. Wow! The battle scenes are ridiculous, with enemies reduced to coins after being defeated, one of many, many repetitive nods in the direction of out-dated games consoles such as Nintendo's.Seriously this has all been done before and with more style. I cannot believe that this pile of equine manure is the product of the same man that wrote Hot Fuzz.I'll make it plain for you - Do you have ADHD? Are you impressed by flashing lights? Do you want dumb American teens mumbling incoherent nonsense as main characters? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, I give you Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.enjoy.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Get pummeled with awesomeness,"Edgar Wright is fanboy gold. Shaun of the Dead proved that he was a director to watch and Hot Fuzz showed that he had a bit more up his sleeve. So what happens when Wright branches out to comic fare without the help of his regulars? We get a film that is nonstop entertainment done in a way that only Wright can. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unique to its very core, the fact that it's also well done and enjoyable is icing on that one-of-a-kind cake.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old Toronto slacker. When he isn't practicing with his band, he is hanging out with his 17-year-old girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). Everything is business as usual until Scott sees the literal girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Scott quickly discovers that being with Ramona isn't as easy as he thought. While dealing with an unclear relationship with Knives he must face off against Ramona's seven evil exes.The casting of this film is inspired. For all those that have grown tired of Michael Cera I urge you to go see this film. At the surface Scott Pilgrim is yet another awkward young man that you've seen Cera do before, but he finds a way to dig deeper into the character. Scott is a flawed individual and Cera is able to communicate these flaws without negating the charm that is at the character's core. It is a tough performance to describe, since it is simultaneously similar to his prior roles while also being quite a bit more complex. Technically Michael Cera is the lead, however very few scenes are all his own. Nearly every supporting actor is able to steal at least one scene. From Kieran Culkin as Wallace to Johnny Simmons as Young Neil, there was not one actor that I tired of. I found myself wishing the film could be longer simply so I could have more time to get to know all of the other characters. Anna Kendrick is sweet and smarmy as Scott's little sister, Aubrey Plaza is endearing as the overworked and unappreciated Julie Powers and Ellen Wong manages to sidestep the chasm of annoyance as Knives Chau. Then there are the seven evil exes who you should hate but just can't. In short, if the saying ""you're only as strong as your weakest link"" is true, then this cast is a diamond chain.The story is fantastic, if a bit simplistic. Bryan Lee O'Malley has created a world that is both ridiculous and relatable. The film is as much a character piece as it is an action film. The writing is able to examine the complications that come with relationships at a young age. Scott is a selfish individual that pays little notice to the effect his decisions have on those around him. Ramona has led a life of regret and is constantly running from a past that will not let her escape. The characters and story are complex enough that you will be surprise to see them following you out of the theater.The reason the film is able to work is Edgar Wright. I cannot imagine this film in any other director's hands. Some have described Wright's style as customized for the ""ADD generation"" but I believe this is borderline insulting. While he does utilize several fast cuts and the film has very few moments that do not cruise by, I believe this is necessary. A comic book does not contain several solemn moments of reflection and as such, a film based on a comic book should not either. I was shocked to realize that the film is close to two hours long since it seemed to clip by at such a fast pace. I may be a bit bias since this film seems to be customized to me. I grew up with my Sega Genesis at my side and a television nearby. Due to this, I found all of the video game and television inflections to be a delight. These references are in no way a distraction, simply a fantastic supplement. If the sound of the Sonic the Hedgehog theme brings a big smile to your face, then this film is just for you.Comic book films have become pretty commonplace. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not be a Marvel or DC film, but it manages to feel much more like a comic book than any film since Sin City. Wright shoots for the moon when it comes to staying true to his source and I am glad he did. The screen oozes comic charm and this allows for the intense fights and stylized musical numbers to feel completely authentic. I believe that a comic should only be transitioned to the screen if something more can be added to the experience in the process. I have only read portions of the Scott Pilgrim comic, but when it comes to the film, I would be elated to sit down and experience it all over again.With this film, Edgar Wright completes a hat trick of memorable fare. Bryan Lee O'Malley has created a story that we've seen before in a way that is completely unique. Wright is able to take O'Malley's fantastic story and transition it beautifully to the screen. Every member of the cast is fantastic; I only wish that each actor had more time on screen. With so many comic book films feeling obligated to be rooted less in the fantastic and more in the real, it is nice to a see a comic book film that embraces its roots. The strong comic book style, coupled with video game accents, results in a film that is never boring. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World will make you laugh and yearn for young love, all while pummeling you with its awesomeness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Fantastic film - funny, fast paced, original","Went to see this last night at Brixton Ritzy and was blown away. So much effort has been put into this film technically - the camera work, post production, audio are astounding - not just technically impressive but creatively wonderful.The story is really fun and rockets along - when the pace isn't fast because of the action sequences which are many and both exciting and funny - then it doesn't ever seem to slow down because all the slower scenes are full of the tensions between the characters.You can tell watching this film that Edgar Wright has complete respect for the comic book and has succeeded in translating it to a great film. The performances of the actors are all wonderful and you can't help but think that Edgar must be really good at allowing actors to relax and feel free to give it there all.Really blew me away this film.

Pass the aspirin,"""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a youth-oriented comedy that is destined to divide audiences into two diametrically opposed camps: those who see it as a brilliantly creative and satirical take on modern adolescence, and those who see it as a migraine-inducing, insufferably pretentious exercise in self-conscious self-indulgence that has desperation written all over it. The movie is definitely an acquired taste, but one thing is for certain: very few who see it will be indifferent to it.Based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a highly stylized, non-linear account of a 22-year-old geek (played, as always, by Michael Cera) and his surrealistic adventures with his friends and band mates (the cast is indeed enormous) – who are a combination of dorks and Goths and just about everything in between – as they do battle against evil forces, most of them former boyfriends of his current flame (Alison Pill), in snowy Toronto.Writers Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright's attempt to transfer the look and style of graphic literature to the big screen meets with only modest success here (Wright also directed the movie), and it's not too long into the film's nonstop assault on the senses that we're compelled to holler ""Uncle!"" purely out of self-defense.The is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality? narrative framework, the frenetic editing, the robotic line-readings, and the words constantly flying all over the screen have a certain novelty and charm at the beginning, but they quickly wear out their welcome – as well as the audience's patience – and all we're left with is a profound sense of relief once the whole thing is finally over.Despite the best of intentions in wanting to do something a little bit different for a change, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" still comes across as a ""cult classic"" trying just a little too hard to become a ""cult classic.""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The World Awaits,"I give Scott Pilgrim a seven rating for its technical virtuosity and for the appeal of its youthful cast. It's a movie strictly for the MTV generation of which I am most certainly not part.Having the film be based on a comic book character certainly allows you not to be bound by rules of reality and if this film is one thing, it has no rules. Giving a lengthy explanation of the plot would be a waste of time, but simply young Scott Pilgrim lives in a communal type dwelling where he plays in a rock band and hopes for a musical career. But before he can have that he'd better get out from under the girl friend problems he's having. A young Chinese Catholic school girl played by Ellen Wong is the current one he's dating. But Scott's got exes and the exes have exes and they're all for one reason or another bad at him. Before the film is over he has to deal with issues involving them all.Michael Cera from Canada plays Scott and the film was shot in Toronto, another example of Canadian product mainstreaming right here into the American market. Cera is quirky and appealing in his own way. I did like Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate and Brandon Routh as the action film star who is an ex of a Scott ex.I admire the work more than I like it. But I'm first to concede that that's me, an old fashioned fellow regarding music who thinks Bing Crosby was our greatest performer.

"True Gamers, this film is for you.","Excellent soundtrack? Check. Great attention to detail? Check. Excellent visual effects? Check. Plethora of funny moments and witty dialogue? Check. Zelda reference? Check, and check. Scott Pilgrim easily ranks as the greatest video game film of all-time. In a cinematic world full of video game movies that fail to capture the detail, pacing, and magic of gaming, we have Scott Pilgrim showing how its done. Superbly directed by Edgar Wright and followed by a great cast of actors and actresses, this film is perfect for the gaming culture, and the deeper you are embedded in the cult world of video games, the more you will enjoy this flick. Word of warning, if you aren't that much into the sub-culture of video games and all its glory, you may not see this film as epic as it truly is.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about a slacker bassist of an underground band (Michael Cera) bouncing around depression and attempted recovery after a tough break-up. While messing around with a high school girl (Ellen Wong), Scott discovers the woman of his dreams, the beautiful, mysterious, and hip Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she comes with baggage: a slew of evil exes that Scott must defeat. Based off of the successful underground comics of Bryan Lee O'Malley, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unlike anything you've ever read; and with the thanks of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), unlike anything you've ever seen. It is tough condensing multiple volumes of a detail-frantic comic book into a movie, but Wright and Michael Bacall did a great job translating the energy, speed, and silliness of the comics into film.Michael Cera gets a bad reputation for being a one-trick pony, someone who does the same type of performance. This is both incorrect, and not really his fault. His scrawny, thin, deadpan look can only get him certain types of roles in Hollywood (he reminds me of the slew of Italian actors that are seen in nearly every mobster/mafia flick of the 90s and 2000s---good actors, but typecast because of the way they look). But if you look at Youth in Revolt and Nick and Norah, you'll see a different side of Cera. In this case, we see a more desperate, less charming, not-as-likable but more ass-kicking Cera taking the spotlight. Then let's not forget the great scene-stealing performances of Ellen Wong, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza, and especially Kieran Culkin.Visually, this movie reflects a video game better than any video game movie ever crafted. The 1960s Batman-like sound effect visuals are all over the place, the fights are exaggeratingly fast and epic, the hilarious subtle details are all over the place, the screen splits into multiple frames constantly, and even the slower sequences flow like cut-scenes of a game. Edgar Wright is perfect for the directing because of his kinetic-style of editing and direction (ex: Hot Fuzz). Perfect for those with ADD, the flick moves from one scene to the next with such quick pacing, entire days can pass through your eyes without you noticing. The battles themselves are so fast, only those with trained eyes (in the art of fast-paced gaming that is) can follow the insanity without giving up.Now, with the movie being made specifically for those that dwell their lives into the culture, it might be an intimidation for those that don't appreciate the art of video games and the slackerish laid-back society it creates. If you don't know much about video games and all they have given us over the years, you'll see this as loud, crass, immature, and pointless. But, for those that have experienced 8-bit Mario and Zelda, enjoyed their Street Fighter II (and allllll their spin-offs), fumbled through Battletoads and Streets of Rage, and know the satisfaction of leveling-up to the ultimate level, you'll get a kick out of this, guaranteed. Just like Fight Club and its counter-culture anarchist ways, and Seinfeld and its New York City post-modern ideals, the more Scott Pilgrim represents you, the more you'll understand and love it.Of course, with the fast-paced style of the movie and the calmer character-developing moments of the comic book, there is bound to hit a contradictory snag. Scott Pilgrim works best when it's fast-paced and with multiple witty jokes waiting right around the corner. So, whenever the movie has a small slowdown to give the characters time to grow and reflect, it really, really feels slow. And while it doesn't destroy the movie, it does slow down the third act, even with an epic final battle and light-hearted ending. After two strong acts, the third act had a tough time catching up. Wright's best is usually saved for last, with Hot Fuzz's final shootout being an excellent example. Luckily though, it isn't too much of a distraction thanks to the wonderful cast and the strong visuals that remain fun to watch throughout the rather-long running-time (for a video game movie that is).Bottom Line: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a perfect movie for gamers, and a perfect movie for those that appreciate the culture, diversity, insanity, and randomness of video games. The cast was great, the editing was flawless, and the directing was grand. While the third act left me desiring more and failed to live up to the strong first two acts, it remains a movie I strongly recommend if you own any type of old-school gaming system. Just like the comic book, Scott Pilgrim is epic, hilarious, fun to watch, and an absolute delight. Yet as previously stated, if you are not trained in the world of gaming, then this flick will unnerve and perhaps even scare you. Visually stimulating, insane, and out of control, Scott Pilgrim represents gaming on the big-screen like nothing I've ever seen before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It just didn't work for me,"Much like the infinitely different and otherwise incomparable Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I get the impression that Scott Pilgrim's biggest failure was in trying to remain too faithful to its existing fans.The character of Scott may well have worked in the graphic novel – it may even have worked in different hands although that assumption would be unfair on Cera. In movie form though, I just didn't buy it. He is, quite simply, completely unlikeable. I cannot think of a single thing he does to make Ramona like him. At the start he is dating a 17 year old who is going on 13. It's an odd ""romance"" that tries to speak of the emotional damage he has suffered at the hands of his own ex. In truth though, the wonderfully named Knives is probably the zenith of what Scott could realistically achieve, girlfriend-wise. Then as soon as Ramona turns up with her roller blades and pink hair, he pretends his current girlfriend does not exist and starts to ditch his band mates even though they're nearing a big break.He is needy and pathetic, and even if Ramona is after a ""bird with a broken wing"" to look after for a while, she will very soon get very bored of it. There's nothing wrong with a likable nerd - and Cera pulls this off believably in both Juno and Superbad to get the hot girl. But here, he's an unlikeable nerd and the best that will get you is a barely legal fan girl.Unlike some of the other detractors of this film, I have no issue with the physical appearance of Cera or the fight scenes as they are so clearly fantastical - although I was struggling to find anything allegorical about them. They did seem to be designed more so as people who already spend their entire time in front of the TV could put the controller down for two hours and still get the same experience. I wanted to like it, in fact I've actually watched it twice. There are probably half a dozen laugh at loud moments which, together with a superb turn from Culkin, invoking an early Robert Downey Jr, and the gorgeously punky Winstead, made this film by means a wasted two hours. However the rest of the ideas fall pretty flat. It probably just tried to be too faithful to its source.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Arguably Edgar Wright's best film to date,"""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is Edgar Wright's third film, following the well-received British comedies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". This film is a comedy as well but, rather than a genre parody, it's an adaptation of a series of graphic novels.The story is fairly simple: When the title character meets the woman of his dreams (literally) he soon discovers that if he wants to win her heart he'll have to defeat her seven evil exes. The story plays out in video game style with battles interspersed among the more realistic elements of the plot.Wright's direction is consistently impressive as he throws all sorts of colourful, energetic visuals at the viewer. I don't know how much of that comes from the graphic novels but, regardless, he did a fine job of translating it to the screen. I can honestly say that I have never seen another film that looks quite like this.The music is good, too. For the fictional bands, original songs were contributed by Beck, Metric & Broken Social Scene. I also liked the apt usage of ""Under My Thumb"" by the Rolling Stones.As for the cast, it's expertly assembled with no one seeming out of place or giving a weak performance. Michael Cera brings his unique charm to the title role and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Ramona Flowers is truly a woman worth fighting seven evil exes for. Kieran Culkin stands out in support and the evil exes are deliciously villainous.In the end, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" may not exactly be 'an epic of epic epicness' but it certainly is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. However, I doubt that most viewers above a certain age group (say, 30 or so) will really 'get' the film. I think that's a shame, though, since the story is deeper than the video game-inspired plot and visuals might lead you to expect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Me vs. Cynical money-spinning exercise in audience manipulation.,"The one star rating isn't something to be dispensed lightly; there are very few films that have so little in the way of entertainment value that they deserve such a critical pasting. Most flicks I've seen that fit comfortably into the category of 'awful' have some redeeming feature, even if it's the dreaded 'unintentional comedy' factor. That being said, when the movie in question is already being marketed as a comedy, a person can really find themselves reaching. So it is with SPVTW, a movie that manages to not only be thoroughly unentertaining and an ordeal to sit through, but one that doesn't even have the decency to let you laugh at it. This is that rare beast: a film that actually makes the rational audience member seethe and froth with rage at how shallow and calculating it is, how utterly empty and devoid of any soul or any artistic sensibility.Of the actual plot, there isn't much to say. Blah, blah, urban ennui, blah, blah, cardboard existential angst, blah, blah, the theme tune from Legend Of Zelda? Blah. Michael Cera once again sleepwalks through a part he seems to be playing via satellite link-up. His philosophy, behaviour, fashion sense and interests are all carefully delineated in order to make him the ultimate hipster composite, an icon for trend-whores everywhere. Will he get the girl of his dreams, whose quirks are equally well chosen to make her his ideal match? Will his tedious garage band make it big? Will this movie try and challenge its audience in any way? Seems to me the mark of a good film is to start from more or less a neutral position, then to actively make you enjoy it via good writing, acting and direction. This is the emo equivalent of one of those dreadful Christian Bible films, where quality is pretty much irrelevant since the faithful will always defend it on the grounds that it's Jesus-friendly. Here the target audience will be so enthralled to see it's own interests acknowledged in 35mm that normal standards won't apply.Hollywood has always made its money by tailoring genre films to demographic expectations - so it really shouldn't be any surprise that a movie so resolutely targeted at 20-something hipster/slacker/poseurs should be as blandly plastic and artificial as any Disney puke-athon. But for those of us who quite like things like old 8-bit video games and anime, it's hugely irritating to find them hijacked and press-ganged into service as garnish for some smarmy indie manifesto. And it's even more annoying that someone like Edgar Wright, who up to now I rather respected for his subversive take on sitcoms (Spaced), Zombie horror (Shaun of the Dead) and crass action flicks (Hot Fuzz), is basically pandering to a ready made market with something as utterly conventional as this. Because ultimately, though it might seem superficially to be a fresh and original product, this movie is total formulaic sludge, full of low-budget indie tropes, jacked up on a hundred million dollar budget.Had it been made by a genuine independent company, with a cast of unknowns and utilising the whole retro gaming aesthetic more authentically, it might actually have been a lot better. Because it is kind of cute and fun to see some old Super Mario graphics crop up in-film, and sometimes the use of sound FX is clever enough to justify the exercise. But then it would probably have won a bunch of awards at Sundance and been remade as precisely the film we have now. So Edgar Wright has thoughtfully cut out the middleman. Indie cinema nowadays is generic enough in it's attempt to be the 'anti-Hollywood', but once mainstream studios have finished co-opting its clichés and CGI-ing the crap out of it, this is the result.Terrible, terrible film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Crazy, stupid, awesome video game fun.","Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I only stopped laughing to cheer,"We caught a midnight show of this, and it was the most original and enjoyable movie I've seen in a very long time. For those not familiar with the general plot: Scott falls for a cute girl named Ramona, and later learns that he can only date her if he defeats her ""seven evil exes"" in battle.The movie effortlessly and playfully moves between reality, video-game surrealism, dream surrealism, and media-based effects (e.g., mimicking a sitcom or a ""Pop-Up Video"" effect). One moment the characters are walking, the next they're passing through a metaphorical door into their conversation, and as they return there's a clearly-labeled video- game leveled challenge. This is ballsy -- if done poorly, it would've come across as gimmicky and stupid, but Wright pulls it off brilliantly, transitioning seamlessly between styles as if he were merely recording alternating lines of dialogue.The movie is absolutely hilarious, with plenty of internal self- reference, tons of classic tropes and clichés (with ""lampshades hung"" on them to make it clear that the homage is out of love), and some of the best deadpan deliveries I've seen (though, oddly enough, not from Cera). Wright's expert sense of comic timing shines through here -- I never thought I'd hear an entire audience laughing so hard at a guy pausing to tie his shoe.The comedy only pauses for the fights, which are SO insanely over-the- top that you can't even attempt to take them seriously. Seriously, even for a video game, these are pretty crazy! Just sit back and accept that keyboard riffs can become dragons, that veganism gives you super powers, and that you can hit a guy hard enough to turn him into shiny coins. (Ooh, neat! Power-up!)This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but if the above sounds like a good time to you, you will LOVE it.

Thiz Movie Deserves to Receive 1Up and 1000 Combos!,"What is the password? Umm... Whatever! That is the attitude of 23-year-old Scott Pilgrim. By watching thiz film, amazingly I feel like back to become a teenager again with my skate board under my feet and baseball cap on my head. It tells about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who has a new girlfriend, Ramona Flower (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Now, he must defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends in video game style duels. Meanwhile, Scott plays in a band called Sex Bob-omb with his friends. The movie is directed by Edgar Wright who brought us ""Shaun of The Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007). He is always able to make any comedy to look smart but it's also funny at the same time. On thiz latest feature, there are some unique and hilarious characters such as Scott's gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin), Scott's annoying ex-girlfriend Knives (Ellen Wong) and Ramona's Indian silly ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha). Even more, the movie is surrounded by fresh Cameo appearances from Anna Kendricks, Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, Thomas Jane and our last ""Superman"" Brandon Routh. Michael Cera seems to be a perfect choice for Scott Pilgrim. He does not even have to act so hard to become thiz character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also delivers a believable character with some punk girl attitudes. The movie is based on the first three series of six black-and-white comic strips by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The Art Direction is very attractive and colorful. They use comical fonts to emphasize the sound and the fighting scene is one of the main attractions. Most of the fight scenes are mind-blowing with those graphics and animations. Yeah it looks ridiculous sometimes, but surely it is well choreographed. Once again, the only way to comprehend thiz movie is by letting yourself being young again. Thiz movie reminds us of how we enjoyed adolescence by living in our own world. Once in awhile, all of us were Scott Pilgrim and there was only us Vs. the world.

My new favourite movie/film.,"Okay, at first, from the adverts I thought this movie was going to suck. I thought it was going to be another teen failure, but boy was I wrong. I absolutely loved this movie, and if any word can summarise it - that word is ""entertaining"". The references to Zelda ( its at the start, and throughout ) and other video games add to the likability of this movie. Well, for me it does anyway, since I grew up with games and more specifically the games they play. Let's not get off topic here, this review is about the movie. I personally rank this movie number 1 ( better than The Dark Knight AND better than Shawshank Redemption ).Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It is pure entertainment, fun and definitely an epic of epic epicness.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Slight letdown,"I'm writing an essay on Edgar Wright at the moment so that gave me an excuse to finally watch this.I'm kind of glad that I saved this as the last film from him that I saw, because I remember really enjoying Baby Driver (watching that again later) and I could probably recite the scripts to the entire Cornetto Trilogy word for word, but for some reason I really wasn't feeling this one.And I don't exactly know why, I found it funny for the most part even if it wasn't as funny as either the Cornetto Trilogy or Baby Driver, and I bloody love all the crazy comic-booky and video-gamey presentation, but the only thing I can think of for why I wasn't really all that into it was the characters.Scott is a wimpy jerk (yes I know that's the point but I think the other problem is that Michael Cera was honestly just...boring in this role), Ramona feels like she'd rather be anywhere else and not at all like she wants anything to do with Scott, and since they are the emotional core of the film, I couldn't honestly care less about what was happening.The real tragic thing is that every other performance was amazing, and hit the perfect balance between over the top and not letting it all dissolve into complete nonsense, but Scott and Ramona are just so boring.But if you didn't guess from my rating, I don't hate this film. Like I said, the directing, cinematography, editing and sound are all Edgar Wright as good as he ever is, the fights with the seven evil exes are all fantastic, and it is funny for the most part. It might even just be that I wasn't in the right mood for it, because normally the things I did like about it would have made the experience a lot more enjoyable for me, but I can't say that it did.Anyway, onto Baby Driver. I'm already sure I enjoyed it more when Kevin Spacey wasn't a known baby chaser.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of the most uniquely enjoyable movies from this summer season,"Since opening opposite Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables and Julia Roberts' Eat Pray Love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World hasn't had a chance to hit it big at the box office. I guess that's because the two pictures I just mentioned have something of a pre-sold audience while this one only has an appeal to those that have read the graphic novels this movie is based on. I'm here to say that despite not having read the source material, I very much enjoyed this movie! Oh sure, it took a while before I got into it but once I did, I never allowed myself to question why things happened the way they did, I just let myself-as one character said-""be in the moment"". Director Edgar Wright put all his creative stops here both visually and dialogue-wise that there were times I wish I could've rewinded some passages just so I could hear and see certain scenes again. So on that note, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World comes highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A dream for any male in his early twenties who grew up playing video games,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is FANTASTIC. I love the comics and could not be happier with how this turned out. Now, it must be said that when it comes to retelling the story as it is presented in the comic, it does not directly follow it. However, I had absolutely no issue with the things they changed. When it comes down to it, this movie does the best job staying true to the ATTITUDE and the FEEL of its source material out of every movie I have ever seen where I was also familiar with both the book/video game/graphic novel/comic. All the characters are spot on.. from Scott to Knives to Ramona and everyone else. Precisely how I would have envisioned them while reading the comics. The various video game reference are spectacular, and there are even some other great surprise references that I won't mention because it make it all that more exciting when they come up.

There's never been a movie quite like Scott Pilgrim before... and there may be a reason for that,"Scott Pilgrim is a normal boy living in Toronto, recovering from a devastating breakup by bouncing off of a high school Chinese girl, when suddenly he becomes captivated by the newbie in town, Ramona Flowers. However, after he suddenly discovers the league of seven evil exes set on controlling Ramona's future, their love lives become tangled, convoluted, and everything gets messy.The first thing you'll notice in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is its incredibly unique style. There's never exactly been a movie like this in the past, and with a visionary like Edgar Wright at the helm, that is nothing to be ashamed of. The movie is entirely based off of the ""Scott Pilgrim"" graphic novel series; but wherein this is the film's greatest feature, it is also its greatest weakness. It's based off the comics- you can tell. And not necessarily in a good way.Edgar Wright has achieved a fantastic way to bring a comic book to life. If you've really been searching for a live-action, 3D, moving version of a comic book then you'll want to pat him on the back. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World gets as close to bringing the ""graphic novel"" style to the big screen as Speed Racer was in successfully bringing the ""anime"" style to the theaters, which in my opinion is pretty darn close. Scott Pilgrim fans will get a kick out of this one; the film pays homage to the graphic novel in more ways than one. The problem is, you're fitting multiple volumes of this series into a 112 minute movie. The characterization is rushed, the relationships are sorely underdeveloped, a load of character history is barely (if even) explained, and you can't shake the ""there's-more-to-this-story-than-they're-telling-us"" feeling that only the hardcore Pilgrim fans are probably exempt from.The acting was solid, the humor was definitely a strong point, but the tendency for the storyline to feel rushed often got in the way of fully enjoying this movie. All-in-all, it WAS a fun flick to say the least; it just wasn't all there.If you're looking for another round of Michael Cera jokes and an intriguing comic book-style, then by all means check this one out. If that doesn't float your boat, then don't bother. Although style is a strong suit here, sometimes it teeters on the brink of being bizarre and immature. Re-watch the trailer- that will be enough ""style"" to suffice for one night.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Warning: This movie is a mega fail,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat all the way through. Worst meaning; it bored me senseless. I was on the verge of turning it off several times and the only reason I let it keep playing was I somehow hoped it would come alive somewhere in the middle, or three quarters in, or even in the last few minutes. But it just doesn't. Despite having the potential to be a good movie - A girl with rad hair colour, a reasonably OK story line, comic strip captions, indie music and quite a few actors I like, it totally fails to be interesting in any way. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities about it. None. There are no characters to like. Or dislike. Since the main character is so totally unlikeable, it's impossible to dislike his enemies much and when you don't actually care if the ""evil exes"" take him out or not it renders the whole experience simply boring. Besides they don't seem that evil, I don't really know what was evil about them apart from being exes. Scott Pilgrim on the other hand is an utterly awful character, I'm glad he's fictional. I'd like to call him quite a few things but I'm pretty sure IMDb would censor them and not accept this review so I'm leaving them out cos I want to warn others before they waste money and an hour and a half of their lives on this movie. If there is such a category as ""indie B-movie"" this is it. Except that ""B-movie"" implies it's so bad it's at least funny. This is not even funny. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen all the way through. So if you decide to watch it despite reading this and it turns out you find it boring too during the first 20 minutes, SAVE YOURSELF! TURN IT OFF! You can spend the remaining 1hr 25 minutes doing something way more fun with your life. Cos pretty much ANYTHING will be more fun than watching the rest of this movie.

Most of it reminded me of the old Batman TV series with the ""Bang"" and ""Pow"" with funky camera angles. Sorry teens, that's not ""mind blowing"" or ""cutting edge"" or ""super trendy"" or whatever great things you try to pretend it is. It's all been done, and it's only new to YOU who haven't seen it, it's not new to most people even.The bisexual thing, or the lesbians, or the gay guy? Sorry, that's not the slightest bit shocking to anyone over 14 years old, that is a big part of far to many modern movies to name. The ""Bang"" action sequences are straight out of Adam West's Batman TV series, and Gamer or Crank have already updated the theme with video game style in the serious action to totally goofy cartoon directions. And the story? Wayne's World had a deeper plot... Really? ""mind blowing"" ? Not even close.Overall, it's not bad, it has it's moments, it's sorta cute sometimes.

"Stands out on its own with its unique blend of media genres, but not for everybody","It seems to me that many people do not ""get"" this film. A friend of mind called this movie ""juvenile"" and ""immature"". I think he missed the point of the movie completely.Now I'm not going to waste my time commenting on all the performances, because for a teen/college love story they are perfect in their supposed way. Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, everyone in the film is perfectly cast and they fit into their characters like a glove, as well as the chemistry between them which is evident throughout. Scott and Ramona's chemistry in particular is kind of cute.Nor am I going to talk much about the screenplay, which is not-quite- unoriginal, it's absurd, yes, but it is as it should be, and the openness with some Hollywood-taboo themes such as homosexuality and directly/indirectly cheating is quite a first, the screenwriters deserve commendation for that. Not forgetting the dialog which is hip and urban as it should be.No, this film is purely about the visual style and this is where it succeeds. An amalgamation of multiple media genres, such as film to video game to music video to comic book to alternative rock music and then back again. It's really loopy but it's done in a tastefully and deservedly flashy way. There's changing aspect ratios, onomatopoeia (the ""WHAM"" and ""BAM"" in comic books in case you don't know), health bars, flying people, weapons coming out of nowhere, awesome rock music, virtual comic books, 1UPs, you get the idea. It's THE film for the video game generation, and it is very proud of it.By using this, ""Hot Fuzz"" director Edgar Wright manages to combine the said teen love story screenplay above with this visual style, and using his frenetic and lively direction, he transforms what would be an ordinary teen film into an extraordinary visual experience. Note that this multiple genre mash can turn people off, as evidenced by the poor box-office returns this film has recouped.I don't know whether it was Wright or Universal or both to decide whether to bring the film (based on a Canadian graphic novel, no less) to life and to this fashion but it was a solid, and to me rewarding, effort. It's as if you're watching a real video game come to life, and the hip soundtrack and unique visuals all help you enjoy the experience even more. I'd call this a successful experiment and let's see more from Wright and company.Overall this will definitely be a cult favorite, no doubt. I surprisingly enjoyed the thrill ride (however absurd and surreal it may be, it's still exhilarating and hilarious) and this film is ultimately a unique one which has to be seen to be believed.Overall rating: 75/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Fresh, entertaining, tiring, nonsensical","The style is fresh, the over-the-top mixing of real world with comic-book-style and video-game-like fight scenes is fun, as is magic, which appears suddenly with no explanation and then just becomes part of the setting. There is laugh to be had too.I really wanted to like this film for these reasons but I can't.Once the freshness wears off, fight scenes become tiresome. When Scott is punched through a wall *again* or the surroundings are damaged by *another* wave of music, it feels the film is reusing its ideas to the death. It should have been edited more aggressively.The biggest problem though is the plot. There is no coherent overarching story. Writers clearly had no idea how they wanted the film to end until the very end. Even a trivia item here at IMDb says the ending was different at a test screening, and you can see that in the film. Truth is, the premise writers chose could not have ever led to a wholesome happy ending. The final fight scene attempts to give this coming-of-age film some semblance of a ""lesson learned"" but it makes zero sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Unfunny and annoying! Truly a film for the now generation!,"Being quite the fan of director Edgar Wright's previous efforts and being a self confessed gaming nut since 1981 and seeing the rise of the Nintendo generation from the beginning who supposedly this film is directed at. I was really excited and looking forward to spotting all the gaming references that Wright likes to sneak into his films and shows.It turns out this film is the most shocking example of what passes for entertainment these days. It was terrible, unfunny and extremely annoying.The film is absolutely tailor made for a generation that has an attention span of about 0.2 seconds. The characters all talk in a similar quickfire style with a camera cut happening almost every half second and the screen is littered with bright coloured, animated fx obviously there to stimulate whatever moronic mind would find this fun.The characters are horribly accurate examples of today culture with protagonist Scott Pilgrim himself being the archetypal anti hero. Weedy, weak, unsure of himself and sensitive along with the token gay friend and 'rocker' girlfriend.This is a nerds wet dream. It places a weakling in a world where game rules apply and said weakling proceeds to annihilate 7 rather more burly boyfriends of the pretty girl he is trying to woo. It's what every nerd, outcast and skinny emo boy in the world wishes would happen to them.I'm insulted that this film wants to the the hero for gamers of the world. I am a massive gamer and absolutely nothing about this film appealed to me at all.Now to be fair I must give kudos to the visual effects in the film. They are both stylish and impressive and the actual fight choreography itself is excellent. To those that think that this is enough to make a film good, even a comic book action film, must have something seriously wrong with them.Do yourself a favour, walk out after the 8-bit Universal logo. It's by far the best part of the film!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
So much fun to watch!,"I saw Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World with my boyfriend tonight at an advance screening, and we entered with pretty average expectations. We didn't think it'd be awesome but we didn't expect a bad movie, either. And having never read the comics, all we knew about the film came from the trailer. Nevertheless we were blown away by how incredibly original the movie was from start to finish, and how genuinely funny it was. The story follows an unemployed 22 year old bassist called Scott, who falls for a mysterious girl named Ramona. To win her heart, he must defeat her seven evil exes. Along the way you meet Scott's bandmates and roommates (Kieran Culkin's character might've been my favorite, every single thing that man says is brilliantly funny) and of course Ramona's old flames (and the battles that ensue).This is a great comedy not to be missed. The performances were all fantastic, and as for all of those who doubt Michael Cera's acting abilities, yeah he does his Michael Cera shtick as Scott Pilgrim but it's truly refreshing to see him kick some serious butt for a change.There wasn't a dull moment. Judging from the audience's reactions throughout the movie, I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is constant entertainment in a way you haven't experienced it before. This is definitely worth watching, but I'd recommend it mainly to a younger crowd.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Achievement Unlocked!,"Scott Pilgrim vs the World An epic of epic epicnessScott Pilgrim vs the World is a film adaptation of the graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim, The film stars Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It's directed by Edgar Wright of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame.Scott Pilgrim vs the World follows Scott Pilgrim as you would have guessed It begins with Scott dating a 17 year old girl Knives, Scott is happy for the most part and is enjoying this cute little relationship. Scott then starts having these strange dreams of this girl. Scott starts seeing this girl called Ramona Flowers around town and then falls in love with her. But there's one little catch. Scott must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes.That is the basic story of the film. Edgar Wright done well into all 6 books into a 114 minute time slot. We also get a different ending from the 6th novel. This film is a geeks dream come true, Edgar Wright has cleverly made the film into an actual moving comic book. This idea works really well for the whole film and makes you feel like your watching a comic book unfold onto the big screen. The film is packed to the brim with references to video games, movies and culture altogether. Hell there's even one scene composed of Legend of Zelda music. You can tell Edgar Wright really wanted to appeal to everyone. Comedy wise everybody in the theatre was laughing. The jokes are like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, they're built upon and thought about before they throw them out. There are a lot of Recurring gags, but the way these are executed make you enjoy them. The fight scenes against the exes play out like a video game boss fight and are done very well. These fights are over the top and just plain epic. A lot of the fights have been changed for the big screen, if these were just copied out of the graphic novel straight out then it probably wouldn't have worked well. Michael Cera delivers a excellent performance as Scott Pilgrim, this is a first that he's played a different character and if film makers gave him a chance to play as a different character then his usual nerdy type persona then people would stop hating on him. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does Ramona just as you would want her to be.The problems of the films are the things it cuts out. For example the whole Eve and Scott flashbacks were cut out and you never really got the sense of them going out. The Katayanagi twins get no dialogue in this film and while the battle felt epic it just felt like filler before the final battle. Scott and Ramona's relationship never got much screen time near the end and that's what I didn't like.The film is one the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen. It's ranked as probably one of the best if not the best adaptation you'll see.Scott Pilgim - 9 0 - World",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
a wet dream come true for the fans of video games,"Scott Pilgrim is a geeky, slacker rocker. He has just broken up with his high school girlfriend Knives for a stunning beauty Ramona Flowers. He has started to go steady with Flowers but to win her over, he has to defeat the league of ""Evil Exes"", the seven ex-boyfriends of Ms. Flowers. This sets the stage up for cool fights. This movie is a wet dream come true for the fans of video games. The fights are beautifully choreographed and the viewer would find himself immersed in a game like experience with points being awarded for hits, the fighters getting extra lives for their acts and earning sword like weapons for love and self respect. Michael Cera mouths his one liners perfectly. Winstead as the object of his affection is stunningly beautiful. Kieran Culkin as Pilgrim's gay room partner is hilarious in some scenes. However, as I am not that big a gaming fan, I found myself disconnected from the movie in many instances. The exes are played by actors like Chris Evans, Brandon Routh etc who are big names and play absurd characters to perfection. If you are a gamer, then this becomes a must watch for you. If you are not much into the games, give this a miss. 3 out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fantastic unique comic book actioner,"Edgar Wright has been very quiet since hitting the headlines 3 years ago for the outstanding British hit Hot Fuzz and in that time he has managed to conjure one of the most original and exciting comic book adaptations ever.Considering the recent successes of The Dark Knight, Iron man and Spider-mans amongst others that is rather bold but somehow the director and writer has taken a simple love story and made it thoroughly entertaining, humorous, diverse and tantalizing it is quite necessary to see Michael Cera stars as Scott Pilgrim who falls for Mary Winstead's Ramona Flowers, a frivolous newcomer whom he would like to date. Only he has to defeat her seven evil exes to do so.What ensues is some of the finest action comedy romantically enhanced comic battles ever to be shown on the big screen. That is to say there are many flashing battle stances with ""vs"" being screened centrally and split screen shots, as if watching a comic book literally come to life.We are soon in the groove when the Universal logo pops up and then we zoom straight in to the battle of the bands, the life of a love struck teenager and his affection's terrible past. There is a lot going on which boasts the excitement and intrigue to maximum velocity and before you know it the film has ended and you will immediately want more.The music is a worthy mention as all the way through there are many knockout hits (no pun intended) and one in particular that stands out.The Clash at Demonhead's rendition of Metric's Black sheep is a fantastic moment for plot and sound and encapsulates the moment significantly.Regarding the fights there are some great cuts of direction by Wright, brining the action to life. The flying words are terrific and often bizarre. There are moments when you wonder what is going on, particularly the vegan police and the dancing skeletons but regardless the context of the moment is always spot on.A few minor hiccups include the viewer's emotions when the film draws to a close and the situation fixating on the final evil ex boyfriend.These are immaterial considering what we have been treated to by surely the best director to come out of Britain since Guy Ritchie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Quirky comic comedy,"Rating-7/10Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a fun comic book action film with bags of great fights, weapons and quirky costumes meaning it is truly like reading a comic. The comedy is fast and so are the sequences as well making my opinion on this film, a just about good one, it is not all plain sailing though and here is what I thought about Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.The story is very fast and all together the fighting is solidly fun but also has a more serious side as Michael Cera in the lead role has to deal with Romance on one side, and all her ex's on the other making for a rollicking action film. The story moves a long nicely and by the end you do feel a certain amount for the characters within who constantly support Cera and make you feel like he has his own groupie's, well in a way anyway.Cera act's it well but I found his portrayal maybe slightly bland and as if he was trying to hard to be much more comical than action like. The cast around him like I say do support him and do a good job in doing so with the character of Knives(played by Ellen Wong) giving off an insanely obsessive performance which made the film even more quirky than it already is. Finally of you enjoy comedy with a dabble of violence similar to say Kick-Ass, then this film is for you for sure.The fight sequences are great and make the film really awesome with it's comic book style sets and the brilliant effects used, it makes for an interesting but slightly strange battle film. I think the set's as I say are great and serve the film well to make it appeal to it's obvious audience(teenagers) and makes it bright and colourful even amongst all the darker violence in the film, but nothing in this is too dark. Overall the film looks great and for what kind of film this is then it is top grade, budget used was well worth.I felt the film although good, had some slightly pointless fight scenes and the way some of them(not all of them) were done was cheesy and some were over in a flash. I said about Cera being kind of flat but some of the other cast members such as his love interest Mary Elizabeth Winstead were underused and made to look like they just didn't care about performing in this movie.I think many film watchers will enjoy this and I can't really see why it wouldn't excite anyone, definitely a must see for comic book fans who also like comic book adapted movies. If you don't enjoy violence then maybe don't watch but there isn't too much blood really, also if you hate teenager centric films then also stay away as this film(even though using actors in there 20's) is completely just made up of this. Overall would recommend to anyone really though and go see for yourself, it will divide opinion I think.I give it a 7/10 overall meaning a just about good movie and maybe in hindsight could have been given more but also less, I did feel it lacked the comedy genre that it claimed to represent. This is the sort of film where you can sit back with some popcorn, or an air guitar and just enjoy it, I know for a fact someone will love this movies quirkiness and awesome visuals +the little action we get dabbled in too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Awesome experience!!!,"I went to see this movie with my family this weekend. OH... MY... GOD! I frickin LOVE it!!! I think I'll look back on it as THE best cinema experience I've had since I saw Star Wars in 1977! Yeah, there have been many awesome films over the years, but as far as the entire experience, this was so double rainbow awesome that totally beats them. In a sea of 3D, this one that dares to remain flat really pops. How cool is that? I had a smile on my face from the moment it started until I was well out of the theatre. Going in I didn't really know what to expect because I avoided the hype as much as I could.

"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010, Edgar Wright) (B)","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010, Edgar Wright) (B)
Back in 2010 after cult faves 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' director Edgar Wright pivoted a bit and did this highly entertaining comic book adaptation. This is a fun, well executed film taking a basic teen love story premise and altering the method filtering it through a comic book, video game lens. This interesting visual style makes for quite the original and different version of a boy meets girl story. Add into that the narrative twists which fit the video game/comic aesthetic and you get a story in a saturated genre that feels wholly new, fresh and original.
Michael Cera stars as the titular Pilgrim and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers becomes the obsessive object of his affection. While at first balking she eventually warms up to him right before it all goes to hell in a handbasket as Pilgrim, in order to win the fair maiden, must best her ""Seven Evil Exes"". In true video game fashion these exes come on like bosses at the end of a level and there are even video games sounds and animation effects to complete the bizarre immersion, but the whole thing works really well. Pilgrim also happens to be in a band called Sex Bob-Omb which operates in Toronto where the story is set, and of course head bad guy and Evil Ex Numero Uno is wrapped up in that as well being a savvy record producter named Gideon played by Jason Schwartzman. The whole cast here is pretty impeccable and the screenplay is witty and has some pinpoint hilarity.
I would actually be interested to know how the comic book version of Pilgrim differs, as this film version is basically Michael Cera. He does alright and works in the role, but I really only like Cera very specifically with his somewhat limited talent. He does work here but I wonder if another actor may have been better. I may just be slightly prejudiced against him at this point. The narrative might be a bit too kind to Pilgrim as well as he is somewhat of a cad, but also plays the woe is me card. He sort of dangles one girl who is obsessed with him. Meanwhile he is falling for Ramona with little to no thought of the other girls feelings. It all comes to a head, but romantically they just sort of let him off the hook.
Overall this is an incredibly entertaining fun twist on a teen love comedy type film that in less capable hands could have been fumbled. With a director as good as Wright working from solid source material with a good script and really good cast you get this gem of a film that is about as original as you can get in this day and age without being too avant garde or niche.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Wonderful imaginative experience.,"To start out, I'd like to say I am 21 years of age, grew up playing video games on the NES, and SNES, and still play games to this day. I gave you that information because this movie is very demographically focused. This is not to say it isn't appealing to all ages, but to get the full experience you need to have played Zelda, Street Fighter, and Mario and been entertained by them. The whole film is a satire of high- school type drama and immaturity. Those who claim they didn't like the movie failed to see the satire and humor in the briefly disappointment and the randomness in the dialog. The acting was way over the top but again, it is a satire meant to be cheesy. If you go into this movie to find some serious drama than you are going to be let down. Since this is not a real downfall I will not mark the movie down like many of the negative reviewers. Michael Cera was obviously type-casted wonderfully as always. The part fits him like a glove and I don't wish for one second they cast someone else. Scott Pilgrim is meant to be an unfit, scrawny, and awkward nerd, which is presented beautifully. Wallace (played by Kieran Culkin) is another notable character being the source of many jokes about Cera's character and light, non-offensive gay jokes. Now on to the love interest. Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is perfect for the role. She is quite cute and of course quite ""anime esq."" with her colorful dyed hair and dangling split bangs. Carrying a fair amount of emotional baggage from her many break-ups with the ""Seven Evil Ex's"" is aloof and casual about her cautious love interest. She is loved a great deal by Scott and provides good reason to fight the 7 ex's. The fight scenes are visually stimulating and peppered with references to games like Street Fighter II, Super Mario, and Zelda. Such is prevalent in the enemies of Pilgrim (Michael Cera) spurting coins with every hit and erupting into a fountain of metal when defeated granting Scott points. The first enemy also makes reference to a n annoyance many of us gamers had with Street Fighter. The Man sang about fireballs while levitating in the air and didn't stop until he was silenced by a symbol to the face (what I would like to think is a reference to ""spamming the hadoken""). People are saying the fight scenes get repetitive but I see little repetition. My favorite fight is the one with Evil Ex #3, Todd Ingram (played by Brandon Routh), who is a super vegan. This battle is the second Scott participates in and the first he tries to mix up the action with (I'd add more detail, but I might spoil it). Effects are amazing. Both audio and video come together to make you feel like you are in some sort of Arcade/ Comic book hybrid. The experience is exclusively unique to this movie. Basically, there is no doubt people who love over the top action, Comic books, and especially video games should go and see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Way funnier than I ever expected,"I went to see this despite having a very mixed but mostly negative selection of reviews. I'm very glad I went as this is one of the most enjoyable and funny films I've seen in a long time.Michael Cera plays the slacker who meets the girl of his dreams only to find out he has to battle her 7 evil ex's. Throw in some slacker friends, a gay housemate, a couple of previous girlfriends, plenty of computer game references and you have a very entertaining film. There are some really funny moments in this, it's really rare to find a film that makes me laugh out loud, but I did a lot throughout. It's also very clever story telling and adding to this are many more slightly less but still funny moments as well as an array of special effects which provide some great visual moments. Clever editing and quick cuts are used to move the story from place to place, effects are used to provide hints of the films comic book basis, but it never goes overboard or becomes repetitive.There is a great support cast, including a very funny Chris Evans, but Kieran Culkin as the housemate and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau also provides some laughs. Michael Cera is a real standout here. He is a very funny actor, though many of his post Arrested Development roles have been, well his Arrested Development role. Here though, whilst he never quite breaks the mold fully, he is less Michael Cera. His timing and delivery of lines is perfect throughout.My main qualm with the film is that it struggles with the story telling time frame. It starts quite slowly and the first few battles happen progressively, but suddenly the rest of the battles are grouped up together which then leads to an overly long finale.However, these issues shouldn't be enough to put anyone off seeing this. It's a funny, visually great romp and you don't need to be a computer/comic book/superhero nerd to enjoy it.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" and he doesn't disappoint with this.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010),"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has Michael Cera fighting the evil exes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It's a fun idea but one that doesn't quite work in movie format. I'm sure with the exes spaced out over a series of books, it allowed for a lot more detail, but here it's very rushed and repetitive. By the time we get to the final fight, it's all a bit samey. The film also fails by having very unlikable characters as the focus of the story. Neither one is interesting enough, nor do they have any real emotional connection. Luckily there's a long list of supporting characters to brighten things up. Evans hams it up as a skateboarder turned movie star. Culkin does a good job as the gay roommate, and best of all is Ellen Wong. She brings a bubbly naivety to a role that could have easily been very annoying. The film certainly has some great moments, such as the Vegan Police, but there are only so many obnoxious sound effects, computer game references, and terrible one-liners I can take.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the Best of 2010,"'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' was executed from a graphic novel to a film very nicely but didn't make it a better film. The movie was great but from comic to movie really didn't make it any better although it probably wasn't intended to make it better. This film exceeded all of my expectations and actually surprised me that a comic like this type could be made into a movie so nicely done. I immediately picked up the graphic novels and it explained a huge amount of references that never got displayed in this movie. I really really liked Michael Cera's performance in this and he continues to be exceptional. The film's tagline ""An epic of epic epicness"" really defines the film for what it is. It was funny, intense, and serious while it has it's own style of a film itself.

Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight,"Scott Pilgrim has met the girl of his dreams, Romona Flowers. Now, he must face her seven evil exes if he is to keep dating her. Now imagine this love story is taking place inside a souped up Nintendo Entertainment System with some of the finest indie music the world has to offer, lovingly directed by the world's biggest geek and edited to perfection by joy pad wielding insaniacs intent on blowing up your eyes with colours.This film is the pinnacle of everything an immersion in pop culture can be. From the parody of the typical 'love against adversity' journey of any typical film, 'Scott Pilgrim' takes the idea of the journey and turns into an epic QUEST. What's more, it's refreshing that the hero of the piece is fundamentally flawed: pursuing a girl while in a relationship with another, however tame that relationship might be, is a basic rule of social villainy- and yet Scott Pilgrim is that awkward hero; not following the laws of what is right, rather going for what he wants and ignoring the consequences. That the protagonist is imperfect, selfish and thoughtless makes him more identifiable as a genuine human being rather than a pastiche of unachievable ideals, and anchors the film's emotional core against the absolute insanity that unfolds.Michael Cera is at his finest here. He is one of those comic actors who has an act and usually sticks with it- even reverting back to it in ""Youth in Revolt""- but here, Cera is not the meek nice guy. He still looks and sounds like Cera, but he's not the smart, sensitive boy we've come to know. He's fatally flawed and does bad things to good people on impulse. Like real people tend to on occasion. Further grounding comes from Kieran Culkin, a revelation as the straight man (so to speak) of the piece and one of several excellent supporting roles peppered throughout this character-packed story (Brandon Routh and Chris Evans can battle for the title of the best evil ex, but Tom Jane showing up as a member of the vegan police for about 20 seconds just blew my mind). Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Romona Flowers is so inexplicably cool you go against your gut and start pushing Pilgrim to fight for her (she even manages to flex some acting muscles, too- ranging from hardened introvert to heart-on-sleeve vulnerability to giant Thor-hammer smashing aggression).Everything about this film is effortlessly cool, from the fantasy fight scenes straight out of Tekken, one of many video game references that the film is saturated in (a dream sequence involves a flourishing arrangement of music from Zelda to great effect). The use of video games within the film could arguably be suggested a critique of our obsession with electronic influences on our lives, but I'm just guessing that the reason they used all of that stuff is because it just looks amazing- it sounds amazing too, probably one of the best contemporary soundtracks I've ever heard (thanks to contributions from Metric, Beck and uber-producer Nigel Godrich).On a technical level, this is Edgar Wright's finest achievement, harking back to the the heady days of sitcom 'Spaced' but with a few million dollars to really push the limits- and I don't believe he wasted a single penny.From the devastating reaction to sunlight (blissfully over the top comic-book framing) on an early morning, and the scuzzy bass that centres the film's soundtrack, you'll come out of this still not believing you just saw this movie. Your brain won't let you believe it's real. Well it's not, but it is a film. It has been made, with loving devotion to its source material- which as to why anyone would even try and commit that to the screen is beyond me, but Edgar Wright just did it. I think he can safely assume his place as one of the most unique and brilliant filmmakers in the industry right now, with this film as a portfolio promising what visions will come next.This film is perfect. There is literally nothing wrong with any of it. As far as the genre of 'comic-book adaptations' goes (which itself is ridiculous, you would throw every film based on a book into the same section at HMV- Jaws and Pride and Prejudice aren't the same now, are they?) this is one of the finest, most standout pieces made. As a fantasy adventure it's even credible, remaining resolutely laid back and lo-fi despite it's impeccable visual style.Just... outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Four words : The Game is never over. That would be 5 words.,"I saw Scott Pilgrim vs the World in the most inappropriate way possible. But there is no way I am going to mince words, reviewing it. It is one of the most brilliant way a movie can be made; something which makes you want more. More than you will ever want.To start off with, there are multiple, subtle underplayed one-liners. ""It is Scott""; ""What has he done""; ""No. It is Scott"". ""Oh. What have you done"". These are teasers. The scenes which don't have awesome kicking-ass scenes; there are rip-roaring dialogues. Over and above this, there is the screenplay that is so convoluted that would make want to tear your hair out in sheer happiness.Secondly, the fights. All the fights are reminiscent of typical game scenes which nobody who has not had a chance to even see, don't deserve to see. But those who have, will enjoy them to the hilt; with pleasure. It is worth it, trust me.Thirdly, the acting. Michael Cera has done justice to the not-so-suave looking but yet cool guy. Kim has you in splits with her sarcasm and of course Ramona Flowers is too cool for her own good.Fourthly, the music which is an inevitable spoiler is replete. To the core and reflective of the recent culture. It is way beyond what an average movie-goer can imagine.Last but not the real least, to one of the most visionary directors - Edgar Wright. The story and the screenplay is slick with an s-l-ick. It is too awesome with the visuals and the screenplay. Editing is typical of an EW movie with everything choppy thrown in for good measure that started off with 'Spaced'. He is brilliant, no doubt.In summary, beg; borrow; steal - watch this movie.

Videogame graphics in a film,"""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" looks like the daydream of a game nerd who also happens to play in an indie band.

Edgar Wright does what most thought unthinkable,"When you read the Scott Pilgrim comics, it's not something that easily lends itself to the big screen. It's an eye-popping comic rife with idiosyncrasies that seem impossible at first glance to pull off in a movie. I'm happy to report that Edgar Wright did it. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a special effects tour-de-force full of all the charm that the comic books had in spades.The movie begins as most know with Scott Pilgrim meeting the girl of his dreams(literally) Ramona V. Flowers. Scott eventually wins her over and the two begin to date. There are only two problems. One, Scott is still in a relationship with a 17 year-old Chinese school girl named Knives Chau. Two, he has to fight and defeat Ramona's seven evil exes in order to date her.The fights with the evil exes are all mind-blowing sequences. The intensity and energy in these fights is kicked into overdrive. The fights are all absurd as you would expect but in such a way you can't help but love them.Wright not only knows the source material well but he also revels in the culture of Scott Pilgrim. The movie is full of references to various video games like Tekken, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Pac-Man. The entire underlying storyline between Knives and Scott is itself a parody of your average harem anime. There's even a hilarious spoof of Seinfeld at one point.The only problem with the movie is that it feels rushed towards the end. The movie has a brisk pace throughout but near the end you can tell that Wright is sort of rushing towards the conclusion. It's understandable that not every part of the comic books can be included in a two hour movie. It is disappointing though how two of the evil ex battles turn into what are virtually afterthoughts.One thing that must be mentioned about the movie is how amazing the cast is. All of them work and don't feel forced or out of place at all. Much hoopla was made about casting Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim but he does a great job. Cera is not playing Cera in this movie, he really is playing Scott Pilgrim. Special mention must be given to Kieran Culkin and Ellen Wong. Culkin steals almost every scene he's in as Scott's gay roommate and best friend, Wallace Wells. And then we come to Ellen Wong who is simply mind blowing as Knives. I've always felt that a character like Knives can never be translated into live action. It's incredibly hard to portray the naiveté and enthusiasm that Knives has without it seeming forced or awkward when done by an actual actress. Wong pulls off both. She plays Knives in a way that will make you view her as an anime character brought to life.Is Scott Pilgrim a perfect film? No, it most certainly has it's flaws. It is however one of the most inventive, visually appealing, and unique films you'll see this year or any other. There is no other film that Scott Pilgrim can be compared to. It proudly stands out as a new experience whether the viewer ends up liking it or not. In an age where retread after retread is filling the theaters that is something to be commended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Great movie,"This movie make me happy. I like the performances, the story and the references of the game.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Visually dazzling, and outrageously energetic. Die hard video gamers will especially have a fun time.","The film centers on Scott Pilgrim (Played by Michael Cera), the bass guitarist for a band, and an overall slacker living with his gay roommate Wallace (Played by Kieren Culkin). His life is suddenly turned upside down when he falls in love with the mysterious Ramona Flowers (Played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Not only does he face the problem of currently dating a clingy teen four years his junior (Played by Ellen Wong), but in order to date Ramona, he must battle, and defeat her seven evil exes (Played by the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, and Brandon Routh), and along the way learns how to be a less selfish person.It's not hard to see why the film, based on the series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, might turn some away. The novels' built in fan base will love the film I imagine, but it might be pretty divisive to those who aren't familiar with the source material, this includes myself. As for the overall product, I loved it.The film is directed by Edgar Wright, who you may remember best for directing truly original, energetic, and hilarious comedies like Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. Like those two, he does this film beautifully. The comedy is wonderful, his direction is great, and he makes this film a visual and audial spectacle. He smartly presents the film in the style of video games, making great use of graphics, and audio, as well as providing some inspired sight and sound gags. Unlike myself though, it could prove exhausting to some, even to the point of Terry Gilliam exhausting, but Wright knew full well what he wanted to make, what he wanted the tone to be, and he hit it right.As for the talent, I do think Michael Cera is getting majorly typecast in this sort of geek role, but he does a good job and provides some good laughs, and fans of his will be surprised by how much ass he kicks. Mary Winstead's character, and performance is great. She adds some clever nuances to her performance, and the mystery of her character makes her all the more interesting. The rest of the cast which includes Kieran Culkin, Ellen Wong, Anna Kendrick, Allison Pill, and the exes who I won't list individually, are fantastic as well, and get some great laughs.Now for the action. There are a few directors who do action better than Wright, but there's no one who does action quite like him. He's simply a master of scene build up, and pacing, and how he shoots the film, matched with the brilliant efforts of his film editors Johnathan Amos and Paul Machliss is simply inspired. Every cut, every transition, every change in frame rate is a pure masterstroke of ambition for a film that is fast paced, hilarious, visually stunning, exhilarating, and brimming with great talent in spite of the film's few imperfections.Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is one of the year's finest films, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Que Cera, Cera.","Another film on our Edgar Wright retrospective, we actually jumped out of order slightly and finished the Cornetto trilogy before watching ""Scott Pilgrim"" even though this film actually came out between ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""The Worlds End"".Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) a rather aimless twenty-year-old Canadian, falls head over heels in love with a parcel courier, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). There are, however, two issues. Firstly, that Scott is currently involved with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) a high school student, devoted to both Scott and too his band Sex Bob-omb and secondly, that Romana has seven evil ex-partners, all of whom are eager to engage in a fight to the death, with Scott, to control her romantic future.""Scott Pilgrim"" is a strange movie for me. I always seem to convince myself it's one of my absolute favourites in between the times I've watched it. Perhaps it's because it should be. It's a wonderful cast of actors I like, Edgar Wright directing, amazing music and full of video game references. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy it each time too - but each time I'm a little disappointed that it doesn't quite reach the heights that I think it does. That it's just a little ... flatter ... than I remember it being.It's perhaps the most ""Edgar Wright"" of his films though. As an adaptation of a graphic novel, the film gets to exist in a strange semi real world, where sound effects appear as visual cues on screen, otherworldly creatures can appear in the battles with the ex's and each fight ends with the opposition exploding into coins. The visual gags, game references and quick cuts come thick and fast and create a movie that is both dynamic when it needs to be, but beautiful at other times. The music is fantastic - I really liked all the songs created for the bands particularly ""Black Sheep"" the song for The Clash at Demonhead, which I must listen to a couple of times a week.But again, as I watched the film it was with a sort of sense of anti-climax as it never quite reaches that final gear, its not quite consistently funny enough or the story gripping enough. I still like it, and I imagine I'll convince myself again that it's one of top ten films and the cycle will continue, but if I'm honest I actually concede that it's just ""really good"" and not ""great"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Rating: Awesome,"This was one of the best, freshest moves in a long time. Despite the fact that we've seen the visual style in video games still it seemed really original and refreshing. The humor was subtle, there were no laugh at loud moments, but it kept the humorous pace from beginning to end. This is my first review, but what can I tell you the movie was slick, well packed, full of fight scenes, action wise and adventurous.The visual effects were amazing, nothing overdone or less effects where needed. Can't believe it didn't go so well on the box office, but I'm sure it'll bank on DVDs or BRDs. maybe the story could've been a little better, but i can't really say there was anything wrong with it.BTW Cera plays his usual ( which fits the story), Winstead is OK, it was a pity Anna Kendrick's character (Scots sister) has a little screen time.All in all, you have to watch this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Not so bad as you might think.,"This was a movie I wasn't expecting to be as good as it ended up being (and likely was all along). It wasn't the best movie ever. But it caught me off guard in a very good way.For those of you (any of the four of you, really) who really like Michael Cera, you won't be disappointed. He play's his character basically how you'd expect him to—a little awkward/shy around girls, but bold at the right times. The only thing I didn't like about his performance was little hints of Napoleon Dynamite that seemed to sneak in from time to time.Creative (very creative and rather original) editing techniques really make this movie stand out from typical comedies but what really makes the whole relatively unrealistic movie believable are the great, high energy performances from the entire cast.The music is also quite unique. Though not a completely original sound, it is a sub genre (with a long hyphenated name of some sort) that is relatively unheard of and was pulled off excellently.A lot of the content of this film could easily have been taken as cheesy/lame if it wasn't for how well it was produced.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
more epic than it said it would be,"I myself don't really like Michael Cera as an actor, but he surprised me here. He stopped being the 17 year old virgin and is actually becoming a character. Sure he still had his dry monotonous humor, but he really made it work here since he mixed it with legitimate acting. Personally i believe that this is the best editing i have ever seen in any movie, ever. All the tech and they way it was put together was so dumb, but it just worked. Edgar Wright found a place among the deitys of film with this movie alone. I won't get into the story since its so amazing that you need to find out for yourself. The basics is that Scott Pilgrim has to defeat 7 evil exes to date his dream girl. All the fight scenes are fantastic, they actually make me fear the super skinny Michael Cera and his shaggy haircut. Definitely my favorite film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Oh! Does he wear glasses?!,"Scott decided to come out to the world during the worst possible year. The general public, rightfully so, was so put off by such idiocy thrown at us this year, that many stayed away from the little films that, in the creativity field, dominated the large pieces of crap. Too bad.First they missed the great Kick-Ass, followed by Michael Cera's other wonderful release: Youth in Revolt. Come to think of it, one of the best comedic talents we have out there barely has a hit to his name (aside from, maybe Superbad) and that's regrettable. Just as nowadays we not only hardly have any music group that has multiple #1 albums, like in the 1990s and before, we have too few great and talented stars, like Cera.I could say SEE: Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World a hundred times, and just about no one will listen. And no, it's not because I'm not a respected critic – who really is? It's probably more to the skeptic viewer who's been burned for far too long.But, at any rate: SEE THIS MOVIE. It was funny, wildly original, fantastically shot, had an awesome soundtrack and deep acting. Nicely, it took what worked with Zombieland and Kick-Ass to the next level. Heck, throw in a little of the original 1960s Batman series to boot.Scott, 22 (Cera) is a nerd and is dating a high school student until he dreams up his dream girl, Ramona V. Flowers. As always, she's got baggage: seven ex's he has to defeat to keep the girl.Okay, that's the (very) basic premise. In between, he comic-book-ish fights them with powers that no one seems to question. The bad guys fly and sling video-game flame balls and Scott equally rises to the occasion with an air knock out. While all this is going on, there's a stalking ex-girlfriend, a battle of a different sort involving a band that Scott's attached to and a gay roommate played perfectly with excellent timing and comedic lines from no other than a Culkin (Kieran.)In fact, Wallace (Culkin) was one of the best characters of the story. It's refreshing to see not only two best friends/roommates be gay and straight and even non-sexually sleep in the same bed – but also of the two, the gay friend is the dominate one. In 99.775% of all films involving the ""gay-sidekick/friend/comic relief"" they're played small, weak – though sometimes all-knowing, but at the same time, it's the straight that has everything together. It's the opposite here. The only other film I can reference here was the relationship in My Best Friend's Wedding, but that, like Will & Grace, was, like always, a homosexual male and BFF female. Here we have a perfect male-male-non-sexual gay/straight friendship.But, I digress; this isn't necessarily a gay-themed movie. This is about action, romance, fantasy, a whole lotta fun and great special effects. In between, you'll meet and love Ramona who has more depth than her hair colors. You'll get inventive ways to fight each of the seven nemesis ex's. Butthat's also a complaint of the movie.Despite the comic book it's based upon, why couldn't it have been 3 or 4 ex's max? The movie dragged a bit, and though each challenge (or battle) was exciting to watch for superbly choreographed action sequences, it just kept going on a little too long after awhile.Eh, just sit through it. Have a great time. It's not for the mainstream – WAY unfortunately – but it's for those who just want pure fantasy, it's for those who grew up on both comics and video games and it's for those who truly believe the geek can get the girl. Doesn't Cera always? SEE THIS MOVIE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Graphic love,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an amusing adaptation of the graphic novel series written by Bryan Lee O'Malley.With Michael Cera, the perpetual adolescent who is now 22 years old, the film has a made –to-order protagonist challenged by dream vision Ramona Flowers, a roller queen with a serious number of exes. 7 to be exact, that Scott must vanquish in order to win her. The video-game, comic-book foundation of this ultra-contemporary analysis of modern young love shows up in the graphic motif almost everywhere: in cloud-formation love expressions and starry explosions of knuckle fighting as well as victims turning into coins.Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister and Kieran Culkin as his gay roommate give Cera the acting support necessary to make the film more than a visual virtuosity because it is really about the combat for true love, a never-ending battle.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Some bits are brilliant,"The first 10 min are brilliant, how it moves into the band and credits. Love the story but feel the ex boyfriend's and fighting are totally unnecessary. The films characters and music is what makes it great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The first movie I've seen in quite a while that made me want to stand up and cheer.,"""Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is easily the most purely and totally entertaining movie that I've seen in ages. It's the epitome of video game culture on film, a great comic book adaptation, and just flat-out fun.For a movie with so many flourishes, bells, and whistles, the story is quite simple and effective. It's even driven by love, awww. Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old video game fan, band member, and a nerdy version of a ladies man. He's also a little immature and selfish, as a lot of people in their early twenties can be. When he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he's instantly and totally smitten. So much so that he forgets his current girlfriend and pursues her with full fervor. And it's fortunate that he's so head over heels, because Ramona has seven evil ex's who are determined that she's either going to be with one of them, or no one at all.And those conflicts are settled by fighting. Wild, kinetic, inventive fights that can only be summed up as epic. Like the rest of the movie, they're infused with video game culture in a way that's irresistibly appealing to me. This entire movie just feels like it was made for me and people like me, and I love it for that.My only complaint is that a little under 2 hours in not nearly enough time to flesh out the myriad of cool characters. A lot of the side characters only get the minimum of attention, and that's unfortunate (but understandable). But hey, you're going to want to check out the comic after seeing this anyway, and then you'll get to see all the cool bits and characterization that had to be omitted to ensure a reasonable running time.Other than wishing it was longer, I had no issues. The movie was consistently hilarious, Cera was a great Scott, Winstead was a great Ramona, the whole cast rocked, the music rocked, the fights rocked, and there was all the style and fun you could ask for. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is the best movie I've seen this year, and Edgar Wright is a genius for pulling this off so well. You may not love it as much as I did if you're not a part of its targeted demographic, but it's such an entertaining movie that anyone with an open mind has a strong chance of at least liking it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Charming to an extent and a well executed adaption of the graphic novel,"To keep it brief and devoid of spoilers, I'll only say that the film is successful in re-imaging its source material and lands a lot of its jokes.

Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has everything you could possibly want in a film!,"Director Edgar Wright ('Hot Fuzz', 'Shaun of the Dead') has given ""the world"" something truly special. He's given the cinematic-world a visually appealing, eye-candy, adventure of a movie! 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is truly a unique film, and one of the best this year!Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old guy with relationship issues. His last serious relationship ended with his heart broken, and now he's dating a 17-year-old high school student, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, we're never sure if he truly likes Knives, or if he's just desperate. But when he meets the girl of his dreams, literally, his world is forever changed. This girl is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and for some reason, Scott has a thing for her – he thinks she's the one. However, to truly be with Ramona, Scott has to defeat her ""Seven Evil Exes;"" he literally has to fight and battle with each one.The most exciting moments in the film are these seven battles. The film keeps these battles interesting by having a variety of characters, each with their own unique personalities. Before seeing the film, I knew that the battles would be video-game-esquire, but I thought that the battles would all be similar, and eventually get tedious. However, I was gladly wrong. Each and every one of the battles were unique in their own ways, depending on who the ""Evil Ex"" was. One is Bollywood inspired, one music-inspired, and more. Some battles are more memorable than others, but each is visually stunning, and unique.I loved the personalities of each of the ""Evil Exes."" All of them were hilarious in their own way; one was a vegan-powered jerk, another was a Hollywood actor. They're all so unique; one was even a girl! Ramona's female ex, Roxy Richter (Mae Whitman), was totally badass and had a slightly special speech pattern. I loved how some of these battles required Scott Pilgrim to use strategy to defeat the exes, and not just simple brute force. Some of the battles required Scott to use what he knows about his opponent's background and personality, and it's gratifying to see how Scott pulls off some of these victories. These ""Evil Exes"" are, for the most part, portrayed by unknowns. The most popular, to me, were Chris Evans ('Fantastic Four') and Brandon Routhe ('Superman Returns'). However, the celebrity-status of the actors in the film didn't technically affect the way we viewed their characters. For example, Chris Evan's character of Lucas Lee was, to me, the least interesting of the ""Evil Exes."" 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' had many, many characters, each different, and for the most part, are likable and enjoyable.Scott has a gay friend and roommate, Wallace, played wonderfully by Kieran Culkin. Culkin's portrayal of Wallace truly stole the film. Culkin's character was funny in almost every scene, and many of his lines were quotable-worthy. Knives was a crazy character that could have been portrayed in two different ways – annoyingly or awesomely. Ellen Wong does a great job at making Knives appear obsessive and crazy, while at the same time innocent and lovable; her character could have easily been seen as annoying, but Ellen Wong pulled her off the right way. Also, Knives is totally badass by the end of the film. Aubrey Plaza ('Parks and Recreation') portrays a memorable minor character, Julie Powers. Julie is one of Scott's friends and has the unique ability to censor her speech, which is hilarious.The film has so many different characters that are so different and unique, that it's hard to choose a favorite. However, there are some characters that could've been better. To me, Ramona Flowers seemed too distant and not-right for Scott Pilgrim. Her character just had a straight-faced, uncaring personality throughout the entire film. I didn't sense any chemistry between her and Scott Pilgrim, but hey, maybe that's what her character's supposed to be like. The twin ""Evil Exes"" barely had any screen time, and had a short battle; they literally didn't speak one line.'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' has an extremely fast pacing, and it works great. Straight from the beginning of the film, you can tell that everything happens fast in the film. The dialogue is even fast at some parts. This fast-pace requires fast transitions, and I felt like the transitions were well-done. The visuals in the film were also amazing and well-done. I loved how well the film managed to pull off a video- game feel, and make it not cheesy. The film had ""pee bars,"" ""coins as rewards,"" ""health points,"" and so much more. All of these things fit naturally in the film, and they're awesome. The weapons were amazing, and the fights were all well-choreographed.'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' has everything you could possibly want in a film! It has wonderful actors, memorably unique characters, an interesting plot, quotable dialogue, a unique style, spectacular visuals, and so much more! It's truly, truly unique (I know I've said that a lot, but it really is!) and is definitely a stand-out film from most that are currently out. No other film this summer, or this year, has been this stand-out since Inception. Both films are definitely on the top of my ""Best Films of 2010″ list, for sure!PS: Who doesn't like Michael Cera? He's such a lovable actor, and has that unique ability to be ""liked"" in any film he does! He's awesome.PSS: 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is ridiculously awesome. Go see it! You don't have to be ""nerdy"" or ""geeky"" to like or understand the film's concept and unique style. I went with a lot of friends, and most of them surely weren't the gamer-types. The film's appealing to males as well as females, for sure!PSSS: Once again, go see 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World!'",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Average actors, superb cutting + effects. Result: Good enough","This movie is like a computer game with slightly better than average humor and a bunch of almost proficient actors in it. The music, the cutting, and the effects not only saves the movie, but turn it into something worth watching.The kids will love the kid themes (like being totally surprised of what's going on in other people's minds) and the adults will love the retro computer game style. The rock fans will love the music, which is apparently Beck ripping off The Pixies (with a twist of emo).The humour is mild. I laughed twice and smiled at half of the rest. I considered leaving the theater several times during the first half hour. Then, however, it finally caught fire.Must say though: I seriously don't hope they turn Mr. main actor Michael Cera into the next Shia LeBeouf.

I loved it,"Witty, silly and tons of fun. Michael Cera plays a bass player for a rock band who falls for an ultra-cool alterna-chick, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who just moved to town. Unfortunately, her seven evil exes have formed a league to destroy any new love interest, and Cera finds himself in frequent Street Fighter-style combat against them. The movie is very heavily influenced by video games, and it appeals mostly to those of us who grew up on Nintendo. Even if you're not one of those people, the film really doesn't completely rely on these references to survive. Edgar Wright, the writer/director of two of the funniest movies of the last decade, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, is a great comedic director, and the film is full of great comedic timing and detail. The movie is also blessed with a fantastic cast, almost overstuffed with great performances, really. There are so many great characters in the film, some of them get short shrift. My favorite character was the girl whom Scott dumps before moving on to Ramona, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a Chinese, Catholic high schooler who obsesses over him for the rest of the movie. I also loved the sarcastic drummer from Scott's band, played by Alison Pill. Last year's Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick also co-stars in a far too small roll as Scott's younger sister.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Something very uniquely conceived, but still felt lacking","OK, i may have built this film up too much in my mind having anticipated it since 2009. I wanted to be blown away by something that had all the elements i love in film and find myself lauding this as one of the films of the year.But for some reason it didn't happen.But there isn't a lot i can focus on as to why.The film has a style and theme that although at times may borrow from other mediums feels distinctly original. It was slick, well acted and never tried to explain away things, instead letting us simply enjoy the madness of it all without giving us any answers as to why it was all so fantastical. This element alone made it enjoyable, but coupled with a very well crafted script and visuals that only served to enhance the mayhem, all the elements were seemingly in place. Even the hit and miss nature of Cera worked wonderfully in this lead role and if his niche is to play quirky and geeky then the comedy side of this suits him better.But what i think was the problem is a sign of modern movie releases now. The hype. By the time a film hits the cinema we know pretty much every plot detail, and even the comical twist in this film (which i will not spoil for others, i will only say 'sexy phase' so when you see it you will know which part of the film i mean) had already been revealed.OK, fans of the comic series will already know the story, but newcomers to Scott pilgrim would maybe like to feel that twist the same way the readers did when the comic was first released.And the trailer itself along with lots of interviews and journalistic pieces on the film have only served to remove the shine on what could have been something quite fresh in a year of remakes and re-imaginings. And this also made the best comedy moments in the film feel like i was re-watching the film for a second time, thus the laughter value had been lost.I know it seems like I'm complaining, but i think the fact i felt the film was an 8 after all these elements had been spoiled had me wondering what it could have been if the promotion of the film had stayed a little more cagey. I didn't expect 'inception' levels of secrecy, but at the same time when some of the best jokes are placed in a montaged trailer you do find that the audience will not react in the same way they should have hearing the jokes in context for the first time.This is definitely a strong film from 2010, but if you had built up hopes of it being something special like i did, you might find that deflated feeling in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A Retro Battle of Epic-ness,"Michael Cera films are close to home for me. Cera always plays a nerdish sort of loner character that I can relate to. Superbad and this are both films by him that I can put my shoes in his position. Scott Pilgrim is a graphic novel series that I never heard of until a few months ago after seeing a trailer for this film. Apparently, Scott Pilgrim is the character in his self titled graphic novel series in which five books were made with the first one being made about five years ago. Im unaware if this one focuses on just the second book (since both the second book and the movie share the same title) or if the movie is just an all around overview of the series. Whatever it is, its an excellent, 80s style, comic book movie combined with likable characters and a mindblowing soundtrack.The standout of this movie is the soundtrack. The music by Scott Pilgrim's fictional band, ""Sex-Bab-Omb"" stands out totally. The music is so intense it shakes the screen whenever played. The music literally causes drawn lightning bolts and jittering of the camera when played which is awesome and gives you the feeling you're in the environment. Its a unique, almost indescribable feeling. Its so fast moving and energetic by the time you realized what happened a new scene appears. Its a feeling that can be had, unless you watch the film yourself.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty two year old slacker whos life activities are playing video games and in a band. Hes dating a seventeen year old High Schooler named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) in which he's gotten a lot of hate for by his sister and fellow band members. He frequently sees a girl in his dreams whom he saw at a record store not too long ago. He meets the girl who is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Ramona is a quiet, shy woman, who is known for her frequent disappearances and mysterious personality. Her and Scott go steady for a while then after a random fight at a concert, Scott is told by Ramona that he needs to defeat her ""seven evil exes"" to continue dating her.The film plays out like an arcade style game from the 1980s and various references to the video game ""Pac-Man"" confirm that as well. Every time one of the evil exes is defeated various coins explode out like a video game causing Scott to collect them which is strangely amusing. Director of this adventure, Edgar Wright has proved to be more than just capable of British Comedies doing Shaun of the Dead in 2004 and doing Hot Fuzz two years later. He is now shown to have a talent in graphic novel adaptations of other series he didn't start as well.From the 16 bit like Universal intro I knew this was going to be a great film. It has some strange moments and sometimes the text on screen becomes annoying and somewhat tedious, but its definitely a teenage movie. Its a movie that should be enjoyed by people between the age of thirteen and thirty and by male audiences. Anybody with a knowledge of classic 80s and 90s video games will like this and the movie does a good job introducing the characters and their personalities to newcomers to the series (as am I). I will hunt for the graphic novels as I am interested in other events held by Scott Pilgrim.One more thing that bothers me though is the film made a mere $10 million in its first week. It may seem fair, but with an estimated $80 million budget its abysmal. More people should see this because it's probably the most original movie in a while. It almost jumps off the screen without the use of the RealD technology which more movies should use. Movies shouldn't use 3D to jump off the screen.

Break out the L word,"For fans of all things geeky around the world, this film is for YOU! Comedy, action, romance, video games, music; ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" has everything you could ask for. It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.Though the character feels quite different to his graphic novel counterpart, Michael Cera does an excellent job as the awkward Scott, Kieran Culkin is perfect as Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a much more tragic version of Ramona Flowers but this change still works well.Scott Pilgrim is a must-see and it deserves more recognition.

Like a really long shitty YouTube video,"You know those YouTube videos where you get a laugh and they are really wild and crazy, but shitty? The ones made by young college kids that are into theater and entertainment and have the nerd skills to produce short little movies and publish them on the internet? Well this movie is like a long version of one of those. I can't say I enjoyed the movie though I did get a few laughs out of it. Unfortunately the movie is mostly boring and is peppered with cheap special effects that only a stoned person could appreciate. It looks like the writer(s) had this idea of making a movie play out like a video game, and just scribbled down the first story idea that came to mind and molded the movie to fit idea. I suspect they were high when came up with this movie. It was a good effort, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are really really bored and have nothing else to watch (like me). Enjoy...or, whatever.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Draged on and on,"Personally I don't think it was as good as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, but it was not bad. Very original and funny. There are clever scenes that only Edgar Wright could come up with. The fight scenes are extreme and awesome. I laughed a lot and had a good time, until the fight scenes just kept on coming.After the 4th fight I began to wonder how I would sit through another 3 fights. The first 60 minutes are brilliant but after a while the movie drags and you wait for it to end. The 7th fight is redone twice, made the ending agonizing. And when I saw that Scott had to fight himself I was about ready to leave. The movie then saved itself and turned the last fight into a funny scene instead.Go see it for the reason that there won't be another movie like this for a while. Experience the fights yourself and you can always leave when it begins to get too extensive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An awesome comedy that stays apart from others,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a very smart teen comedy. While being a romantic comedy, it also makes jabs on video game culture at the same time to create unique storytelling and cinematography. Thanks to its fast-paced action, eye-popping visuals and spot-on references on recto gaming, Hot Fuzz director Edgar Wright successfully turns this simple comic book adaption into a funny, innovative and very awesome epic comedy flick that sets itself apart from the crowd.This is a film based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel with the same name. While I didn't read any Scott Pilgrim novels, I still got engaged in the films fast paced story. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is the basest of his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who one day, befriends with Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who turns out to be the girl of his dreams. But in order to win her, Scott must stand up and destroy Ramona's seven exes.The acting in this treat of a film is very witty and well-directed. Michael Cera is very fitting for the title character Scott Pilgrim, delivering his speedy lines in a stable, geeky and enthusiastic way which to me, made him very likable. The same goes with the rest of the cast members including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona and Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate Wallace. Even the seven axes are spot-on, each one being unique and distinctive from each other. While I was a little annoyed with the lack of character development, the characters themselves were still fun and believable.In addition to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World's witty dialogue, references of old school video games are scatted throughout the film. Not only are they done in such a humorous way and give the film personality, but they also act an important storytelling device. This is no game of ""spot-the-reference"" like in those ""Movie"" movies. In Scott Pilgrim, these references help the story keep its flow and pace and gives you the feel of being in a video game. Whether it's Scott's bands name that's taken from the Mario villain or the boss battles that humorously mimic classic fighting games like Street Fighter and Mortal Combat, they are all excellent and retro gamers will easily pick them up.It's not just the video game jabs that make this movie so cool. There are amazingly flashy special effects which dominate the films cinematography. What I found special about them is that they are very unique, not clichéd fireballs or gunfire like in other action movies. But instead of those, we are provided with effects varying from classic 8-bit pop-ins and dazzling and colourful light clash effects during the battle scenes. As a bonus, enemy remainings are coins instead of blood. Score!I had a blast watching, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. It's dazzling, wittily written and filled with nostalgia, but it's such a shame it failed at the Box Office. To finish off, this is a cult film that I highly recommend, especially for fans of the novel, video games and Wright's other works. ""B+""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Comic adaptation - Plot kind of pointless, but great special effects and good acting","It's scaringly close to the Comics 'Scott Pilgrim'. You can almost read along the Comic Issues and see a lot of similarities - That's well done. The special effects are cool, the actors do a good job. But after 35 minutes everything already seemed so pointless to me that I fast forwarded to the end and I don't regret it.

A Delightfully Offbeat Comic Book Comedy,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, ""Knives"" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face ""It's okay, neither have I."" Or the band's self-introduction, ""We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Good, Entertaining, Epic... but not that great...","OK, I have read the Scott Pilgrim books, I love them, they have a ton of heart and a lot to offer. I read the books because i saw that Edgar Wright was directing this, and I loved some of his other films, (Shaun, Hot Fuzz) I really thought he could make this work.For the first half of the movie the story stays surprisingly close to the books. I was very hopeful, however soon after the eternal sadness the movie started to drift, and the battles became closer together, leaving us no time to appreciate what Scott is fighting for. He loves Ramona, which is what the entire series is about. In the movie we seem to loose track of that.This movie has little heart and thats the biggest complaint I have. The movie is hilarious and the fight scenes are great, the characters just aren't developed enough for me to care.Overall go see this movie. It is worth it. But then afterwards go out and read the books. They're much better. Much funnier. and have so much more heart than the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You either love it or hate it,"Im going to keep it short and get straight to the point. This movie is not for everyone, the younger crowd of teenagers will probably enjoy this film for all the flashy animated scenes and references a lot more as apposed to a 40 year old, who wont completely understand the comic book style setting, and think of it as childish. In the same breath this movie cannot be mistaken for an animated style children's movie. There are some openly gay sexually related references that don't seem to fit into the over all bigger picture at all. The movie jumps around quite a bit not really knowing what age group its trying to target. Often i'd find myself thinking i'm watching a movie that would appeal only to a 14 year old girl, and at other times i would feel like the movie just isn't appropriate for the younger crowd at all. The film doesn't seem to have much of a lasting appeal and no message that its trying to convey. The whole movie is built up on many quirky one liners and the characters don't really seem to fit there role. I've never seen so many woman chase after a bunch of nerds in the fashion that this movie portrays. It almost feels like they were the ones who wrote the script, and if you're not a comic book fanatic, you might not enjoy this movie as much as what you would have hoped. the only good aspect of this movie would be pretty, flashy camera work. Other than that this movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who made it through high school. The movie just tries too hard to be ""cool"".

A love letter to the wired generation,"Let's get one thing clear: 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' will not be a universally-loved classic. It will not be well-received by the majority of the cinema-going public. The reason for this is that it is a niche movie. It is a celebration of all things geek, and is far too quirky for an audience that expects its summer flicks to be conventional. That it has not done particularly well at the box office is an indication of the power of the advertisements, which have successfully alienated the mainstream. With that out the way, let's get talking about marmite.After the success of 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', Edgar Wright found his foot in the Hollywood door. When he made it big, it was easy to assume that he would follow the same formula that's worked so far: more Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; more blood-and-Cornetto Brit-com genre-mockery. Not in a million years would anyone have guessed what his next big project was: an adaptation of an unknown Canadian comic book, inspired by Manga and videogames, about twenty-something year-old geeks struggling with love and life. It was certainly an odd choice, but a damn good one. One thing is certain: Wright has successfully avoided director typecast syndrome.'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is a love letter to late-20/early-30-year-olds, the generation who grew up with video game arcades, Nintendo and MTV. This is a movie built on retro appeal. Throughout the film, the audience is treated/subjected to a myriad of lovingly- crafted pop-culture references. This is a world where absurdity is something to be proud of, where anything is possible. It is a story about a 20-something year old loser who falls in love with a girl, but has to defeat her 7 evil exes in order to be with her. It sounds like the premise of a video game, and it is no coincidence that the film is structured like one. To call it a 'geek movie' would be an unfair oversimplification.The film perfectly merges 'reality' with the worlds of videogames and comic books. The visual style is unique: while Zack Snyder's '300' and 'Watchmen' were visually spot-on *translations* of their source comics, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is literally a moving comic book, complete with split frames and spelled-out onomatopoeias. This is geek comedy vs. Street Fighter vs. Adam West-era Batman, a combination that works surprisingly well. Action sequences haven't felt so fresh since 'Kill Bill', Quentin Tarantino's own pop-culture cocktail.It would be very easy to dismiss this film as gimmicky, but the film doesn't rely on the visual style to hold it up. This is a funny movie, with an endless stream of sharp dialogue delivered by a great cast. Keiran Culkin almost steals the show as Scott's gay roommate. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a layered performance as Scott's love interest, nicely balancing a tough, mysterious side with a sad vulnerability. Michael Cera plays Michael Cera again, but he has expanded his repertoire slightly, convincingly adding depression, anger and optimism to his default awkward insecurity. The editing is particularly impressive, with the occasional sleight of hand demonstrating just how far Wright has come since 'Spaced'.Weak points? Not many. The film struggles to maintain its momentum, getting a bit repetitive towards the end, but it ends before it outstays its welcome. The music might be a bit hit- and-miss for some. The film's biggest 'flaw' is that it is so very geek-centric. Pop-culture references and quirks are fun and a great source of humour, but only for those who get it. Non-geeks will most likely find this film one-dimensional and repetitive. Still, blaming the film for catering to geeks is like blaming Picasso for catering to Cubists. Bottom line: this is a well-written and stylishly-presented film. Literally POW!-packed and full of win, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' stands to be the most unique film of the decade.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Battle Royale,"To say the last ten years have brought forth many comic adaptations would be a daft understatement. With CGI coming of age, as well as the attention deficit generation, it made sense as a source.But until recently, most adaptations were actually films. That is - you were watching a film of a comic. With Scott Pilgrim, you are watching something that is part film, part comic, part video game. The logic of the film is not entirely cinematic. If you don't read comics or play video games - you simply won't be able to progress to the next level. Even when the logic runs as a film, the genre keeps altering through rom-com to bollywood. The constant battleground is a post student McJob Toronto, with a sort of 90s view of geek rock.While the plot is simply guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy battles with mystic evil ex-boyfriends to the death, the film isn't too bothered whether the audience is involved or not. Cool and funny things happen, but it seems all a bit esoteric.While much of the sensibility is Kevin Smith vs Douglas Coupland, and therefore pretty funny, I would expect that it will take a few more tries in this direction before a true classic emerges. But the attempts will be entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Best movie of all times,"Everything in this movie is SO creative, innovative and unique, it's got so much style. No other movies use visuals (effects and scene cuts) to emphasize the story like this, also the music and sounds are amazing.It is absolutely my favourite movie, it feels like it was built around me and all my favourite themes:
early adulthood, friends, sharing flats, having a band, music/concerts, moving, liking a girl, love, exes, being stupid, sarcasms and making funny jokes.
I feel so immersed in every single scene, it's like I've lived all these situations, I'm 100% there, and the situations I haven't lived, I would have liked to live them.There are a few things keeping it for perfection though, the movie was cut too short, it should have been about half an hour longer, as the last third gets repetitive and crammed, it loses quality. Also maybe there are too many action/fight scenes for my taste (I prefer dialogues), but most of them are exceptional anyway.
Note that I'm not complaining because it's not 100% loyal to the comics, just that they should have developed Scott's and Ramona's relationship more, so the ending would have hit much more.Still hoping for any sort of sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Appreciation depended on Cerra,"This was the year that we saw several little known comics made into films. Kick-Ass was the first out of the gate and in my opinion, the best. We were then given this film, Scott Pilgrim, directed by Edgar Wright. The biggest difference between the two films is your enjoyment of Scott Pilgrim is far more dependent on your tolerance/enjoyment of several elements.Firstly, you must be a fan of Michael Cerra. With Scott Pilgrim he continues the same shtick that he has presented in pretty much all of his roles to date. I personally have grown tired of that shtick. He doesn't ruin the film for me, but my weariness of his seemingly limited range kept me from fully appreciating the film.Second, you need to have a frame of reference when it comes to video games. The film, as is the comic, resides in the world of video game reference. I personally enjoyed the continual video game style of story presentation, however this is not going to be something the general movie audience will appreciate.Third, you need to be a fan of Edgar Wright's direction and story telling skills. Personally, I love Wright's direction and story telling skills. Were this film directed by anyone else, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Wright's quick cuts that he is known for do overstay their welcome as the film is done almost entirely through quick cuts and that can be jarring.My biggest issue with the film is Cerra. He is still playing the same character that he has played in previous films. Why that is a problem here is that compared to Ramona's previous ex-boyfriends, you have to scratch your head as to what there is about Cerra's Pilgrim that would attract her to him. This believability is a very high hurdle to get past, especially if you are not a Cerra fan. I don't hate the guy, I just think this film would have been better served with a lead who actually looked the part. What hurts the casting of Cerra in the lead role is he pales in comparison to Ramona's, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ex-boyfriends. The boyfriends, played by Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, etc, look like they would be someone Ramona would go after. Cerra's Pilgrim has nothing in comparison to offer. Ultimately, I found myself not pulling for Cerra and Winstead to get together, rather, for Cerra and his dumped girlfriend, Knives Chau played by Ellen Wong, to stay together. This is a major issue with the story as we are supposed to be pulling for Scott and Ramona to be together.All of the supporting characters are wonderfully brought to life. It is the supporting characters, action and Edgar Wrights direction that ultimately pull this up to a 7 for me. It is Cerra's casting that reduces this film's rating. Again, I don't want to come off as a Cerra hater, I just think his continued reliance on the same mannerisms, voice inflection and his overall physical inadequacies, make his Scott Pilgrim not reflective of the Pilgrim from the comic. Or for that matter, a hero lead that is believable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scott's Generation,"Scott Pilgrim V. The WorldScott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a young-ish (maybe 23) bassist of an underwhelming garage band, Sex Bomb...err, Sex Bomb-omb...with a lifelong hobby – no OBSESSION – of video games. His life is secure. He is involved in a sexless relationship with a minor: video game enthusiast, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). And his hard working roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) pays for everything, including their apartment.Pilgrim's life is basically unchallenged till, one evening, he dreams that some mysterious girl is out there. And, a bit later, it turns out that she is! Her name is Ramona Flowers, the American with no money worries, a big apartment, and no significant other hanging around.Scott sees this as a chance to upgrade his relationship status. Besides, Ramona and he seem to connect. But, the illusion of Ramona's trouble-free availability changes as quickly, and as often as her hair color. Soon, Scott learns that he must overcome Romona's exes...err, SEVEN EVIL EXES...as well as his naïve world view in order to hook up with the girl of his dreams.But, alas, life is a video game!...so, anything is possible. That naivety thing is tough, though.This is a touchstone film. It speaks to the generation of the characters it highlights as well as bespeaks of them. (For this article, I'll call them the GENERATION.) It joins other touchstones such as Love Story, Brian's Song, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Clueless...and, much further into the past, Les Quatre Cents Coup. As with the first three of those films, it got very little critical acclaim when it was released. And unlike all of those films, it was a financial dud when it was released, during the middle of the Great Recession. But it garnered much critical mention as time went on from original viewers, as they learned to speak for themselves...as well as many DVD buys.Scott Pilgrim V. the World was directed by Edgar Wright, the English director of Shawn of the Dead. It's based on the unfinished – at the time of the film's release – graphic novel by Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley. How much this has to do with O'Malley's personal life, I am uncertain. (But that is a major topic many of the GENERATION debate.) It does seem to be a collaboration between O'Malley and Wright, however. The supporting characters have a lot of substance to them...a substance that isn't present in other Edgar Wright films.These characters have a Scorsese feel to them. Chris Evan's Lucas Lee, one of the Seven Evil Execs, generates enough interest to have his own film, much less the minor role he plays here. Mark Webber's Stephen Stills, is also a stand out as a supporting character, the leader of the band.Scott Pilgrim is a drama-edy/fantasy. While Love Story, Brian's Song and Quatre Cents had more social perspective, Scott Pilgrim shares with Clueless the success of replicating the language of the GENERATION. And the video game world that Scott Pilgrim created puts it up there with Ferris Bueller as showing a lifestyle that the GENERATION wants to lead. (The REAL question is if THE GENERATION is caught in the same delusion that Pilgrim is...not if they can IMAGINE their way out of it.)Of the bunch, I liked Quatre Cents and Clueless the most. But I haven't sat down to watch any of them in sometime. This is the first time that I've seen the Scott Pilgrim in awhile. As with all touchstone films, you need to be in the mood to see it. And, no matter how well it's made, these films always lose their immediacy after the first year.Strangely enough, two co-workers from the GENERATION had viewed V. The World the same day that I had, and it became the topic of conversation that workday. They had seen it a month prior, too. It's obvious that this film will be the topic for the rest of their lives - as all touchstone films should be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The perfect blend of video games and anime.,"Edgar Wright is one of my favourite directors working today. His films are oozing with creativity, style and innovation that I don't think anyone else can replicate. Only a visionary like him can make a movie like Scott Pilgrim work.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with the beautiful hair dyed Ramona Flowers but has to first defeat her seven evil exes in order to win her love.This is a movie that could have EASILY gone wrong but thankfully Edgar Wright manages to pull it off. This is one of the most entertaining films to ever be made. Everything in terms of the film's presentation is extremely creative. All the battles between Scott Pilgrim and the evil exes never become boring or tedious due to the variety of fighting styles each one possesses. Not only does this film feel nostalgic but it's also refreshing to see something different and unique. This doesn't feel like a studio-led movie but one that had a lot of effort put into its story, dialogues and craft. The visuals provide for some really hilarious moments and the subtle nuances in the dialogue add to the creativity of the movie.Michael Cera essentially plays Michael Cera in this movie but it's effective as it perfects reflects the character of Scott Pilgrim. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is terrific as Ramona and has great chemistry with Cera. Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzman, Brandon Routh and the rest of the evil exes fit their roles perfectly and look like they're having the time of their lives. Kieran Culkin is really funny. The cast is generally fantastic.A staple in Edgar Wright movies is the fast paced editing which is no different here. The movie does not contain a single boring moment. Just by watching the film you could see how well thought out every element was. The constant X symbols and numbers telling you which evil ex Scott is facing are a few examples of the clever cinematography. The fights are really well choreographed and are directed with such grace and style. There really is no film quite like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.If you are someone who loved playing video games and watching anime or martial arts, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is for you as I believe it has the perfect blend of all of these.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The video game related action was entertaining and it actually had pretty good choreography, the visual effects made it look so nice.Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, a slacker musician who must win a competition to get a record deal and battle the seven evil exes of his newest girlfriend Ramona Flowers which is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Michael Cera is perfect in this role, energetic and full of comedic talent. The whole cast was great.Bill Pope served as the cinematographer and his work is why this film works so well, on top of the writing and direction. The editing and pacing is excellent, the high tempo makes it so it's never boring, the editing deserves a lot of praise. The transmedia storytelling might be off putting for some but it works so well with this film, it wouldn't be a cult film without it, I'm sure. This might be one of the best comic book adaptions as the visuals are perfect, as it matches the style of video game and comic book imagery, that and the story plays out like a graphic novel in a way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
7.6/10 - I love This Film Much More Than It Deserves,"An epic of epic epicness indeed.Scott Pilgrim vs the World (based on a comic book named Scott Pilgrim) is a cult film from 2010 that follows Scott Pilgrim, a young guy from Toronto that finds out, as he starts dating the new girl in town, Ramona Flowers, that he will have to defeat her seven evil exes in order to go on dating with her.This film. Oh, this film. It's so dumb, yet so fun. I watched it like 4 or 5 times by now, and I enjoyed each and every one of them. I love so many things about it - the iconic dialogue (so many quotable moments), the memorable characters, the video game aesthetic, the awesome soundtrack and score (produced by Nigel freaking Godrich! Haven't noticced that til now), and the EPIC cinematography. It's so fun. Pure fun, even. The cast is great too, and feels really on point. You can see that they had fun making this film as well.I love the vibe of almost everything here, and a lot of the jokes are just sooo iconic and hillarious. This film doesn't take itself seriously at all, and I adore it.Okay, yeah, I admit, I have some problems with this film. I think that the 4th ex is kinda lame and not that interesting, and the whole encounter was kinda awkward. Some jokes are a bit cringy and didn't work that well with me (tho I do like the humor of this film in general). And, maybe Scott and Ramona do come off as jerks in a way and the conclusion of this film isn't as wholesome as it tries to be. Like, something just doesn't feel right, in a way.But you know what? These problems are minor in this kind of film. This film. Is. Just. FUN. So fun, dammit. I'm gonna give it a 7.6/10, but I want to let you know that I still really really love it, probably more than it deserves.P.s
The easter eggs are really cool too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Had no idea,"I remember seeing the previews of this film. I was about at a 4/10 for interest. One day I was bored and saw it on Netflix. And since I had heard a lot of good things about it, I decided to take a watch.Wow. What a badass film. It's funny, it's interesting, it's creative as hell, and awesome music. By the end, I sort of nodded my head and said to myself ""Yeah, that was a masterpiece.""Edgar Wright really is a genius. Every second of this film is packed full of entertainment.

Movie shaped out of the video game world,"Great movie. It reminded me of the other Michael Cera films, like Juno and Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, maybe? This film kept me interested throughout most of the film. Plus, the obvious humor and the graphics were a great plus, too.The plot was certainly different. Come to think of it, this whole movie was like a video game unfolding right before your eyes. I found myself getting bored in the fight scenes, but I think those parts were pretty good. It just wasn't for me. The storyline was different, but it worked. It did, somehow. The ending was also unexpected. Totally love Knives.Overall, I think what I liked about this movie were the characters and the graphics. The plot, while interesting, just wasn't for me.

This movie does not deserve a 8.1 score.,"I went to watch this movie because of the high score from IMDb. I did not find the trailer attractive at all and I thought it can be a movie I watch on DVD rather than going to cinema. I trusted IMDb score and went to watch it. Just to say I almost forgive every bad movie I watched and usually I see the good side of the movie.First of all, for people think this movie is funny, your laughing point is really low. I would rather watch 'Lair Lair' again for some meaningless laugh than this one. There is no clever humour in this movie, I have no idea what this movie is trying to achieve in there jokes. I think the complaint of Scott's hair is a bit funny and also annoying. The romance between Ramona and Scott is not moving whatsoever and I think the writer trying to implement some hidden meaning to imply personal relationship of the real life. All I can say is that there are plenty of other movies have done a better job than this.If I didn't believe what IMDb score said, I would probably rate this movie a little bit higher. Plus the screen I went was an absolute nightmare. I thought I was watching a pirate movie. Anyway, I rate this movie 5 as a fair score in my opinion.

The plot is very weak, bordering on non- existent and the acting isn't great.Unless you are under the age of 16 or you like films in the format of video games, I would be surprised if you enjoy this. I should have read the reviews more closely as I see that a lot of people have also given this film the score it deserves. Don't waste your time on this atrocious film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scott Pilgrim may be the beginning of a cult film,"(Synopsis) Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is an unemployed 23-year-old bass guitarist in an up and coming garage rock band who is dating a cute 17-year-old high school girl, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is having fun in life and rolling along at a nice even tempo until one day Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) rollerblades into his life. Ramona moved to Toronto from New York City to find peace and quiet and leave her past behind. No one knows what her past is, but Scott will find out very soon as he tries to make Ramona his new girlfriend. Before Scott can begin dating Ramona, he must prove himself by defeating the league of her seven exes who controls her love life. They will do anything to get rid of and destroy any new boyfriend Ramona may consider. If Scott wants to find true love with Ramona, he must defeat all seven, before the game is over.(My Comment) Scott Pilgrim is a comic book/video game and love story fantasy/comedy all in one movie. Scott is kind of a geek who falls in and out of love with many girls and Ramona has commitment issues. Putting them together only made for an incredibly funny experience with many laughs at one-liners and sight gags. The movie has a lot going on, with a love story, outrageous fight scenes, to awesome music, and visual effects with points and coins when Scott wins. The fight scenes are non-bloody and you don't have to take them too seriously. Each fight scene is more outlandish than the last one and some of them are used just for comedy. I was surprised to find myself enjoying the movie, because I am not the target audience for this. This is definitely worth watching, but I'd recommend it for the younger crowd (20's & 30's), it may even become a cult film.

Fight for a Reason,"Based on a popular series of graphic novels, this elaborate action comedy focuses on an unemployed youth who finds his life turning into a video game in which he has to 'battle' an attractive girl's exes to secure her heart. Director Edgar Wright uses several dreamy scene transitions to establish a blur between reality and fantasy early on with characters in one frame seeming to interact with the action in the next frame. The film is also populated with eye-popping special effects, ranging from info graphics to words and lines that jump off the screen to comic book style punches and blows during the fights. In short, it is visually arresting motion picture through and through. The universe in which the film exists does not always ring true though. Much of the fun comes from how lead Michael Cera is absolutely baffled by the superhero-ish powers of the exes, but nobody else seems to think anything of comic style fights breaking out in the middle of concerts or on movie sets. None of the fights come with much sense of danger either as Cera bounces back being dropped and whacked unscathed like a cartoon character. Never to mind, the film offers a sufficiently engaging parable of the issues facing young adults today with everything that occurs in the film highly metaphorical. It is about Cera standing up for himself (and to himself!), getting over his old girlfriend who he is still pining for, and going the extra mile to win the heart of a girl he fancies. Whether he ends up with the right girl is debatable, but the journey alone is worth experiencing at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgram stays true to its roots and allows for a home run by Cera and Wright,"In an age of comic book blockbusters around every corner rarely do we get to experience the piece's film adaptation how the original visionary, the comic book write, saw it. Scott Pilgram vs. The World Changes that. It gives you the humor, excitement, visuals and rapid pacing commonly associated with comics during 2 of the most enjoyable hours you will spend in a theater this summer. The writer and director of two of the better comedies of the past decade, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright takes on this interesting piece and does an incredible job. And casting Michael Cera was perfect. He may get a lot of hate for having the tendency to play the same role, but I believe that is because he is so talented he makes you feel like he truly is that character, a skill that is many times overlooked in comedies. At times it may fell lengthy, but that is due to the pacing of this movie. There is absolutely no down time. One scene blends directly into the next and so on. It is a very unique concept that many other comic book movies should consider in the future too. The only thing that is going to hold this movie back is the HORRIBLE advertising. If I hadn't won free tickets I can honestly say I would not have gone. Whoever is in charge of these advertisements should never be given another job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"What video game movies should be, and it's not even based on a video game!","By nature, I do not care for rom-coms in the least, but for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I'll make a rare exception. It's unique, funny, and oddly romantic in parts, mixing your traditional romantic comedy with video game and comic book elements.While calling a movie a video game is usually a derogatory thing, here it's part of what makes Scott Pilgrim so much fun. The fight scenes are what a video game movie should be: colorful and completely over the top in every way. Imagine if the Super Mario Bros movie from the early 1990s had been shot like Scott Pilgrim-- or most any video game adaptations which try way too hard to cram their sources into realistic and traditional cinematic narratives. Another plus is the way this movie subverts rom-com clichés, from the character types seen in these pictures to the way the plot goes.I had to borrow the DVD from a friend, but I totally need to get this one as soon as possible.

Scott Pilgram vs. Me!,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (or at least the first 45mins of it) is the most Putrid, Disgusting, Insulting, Vile, Humourless, Trendy, Ugly, Offensive, Appalling, Awful, Detestable, Dreadful, Obnoxious, Hideous, Loathsome, Pretentious and Repellent piece of film making i have ever seen! The acting was awful, the dialogue was awful, the characters were all horrible people, the editing was obnoxious and annoying, the special effects were obnoxious and annoying, the story was Annoying, the music was awful and there was Not one Single Redeeming or Likable Feature about The Whole Thing!The frenetic editing style mixed with lots of colourful flashing things almost seemed like a desperate attempt to keep the audience focused on the film, treating their aged 16-25 demographic like magpies with short term memory loss, if there isn't something flashy, colourful and new on the screen every 10 seconds their eyes might wonder away from the screen and down to their iPhones, since they just can't stop themselves from updating their Facebook status in the middle of the cinema. Besides that i found the whole arcade game mixed with comic book style tiresome and ugly to look at.The whole film is so obnoxious and in you face all the time with its ""oooh we're so geeky, cool and retro, yeah 8-Bit rules, i'm in a band!, Pac-Man is so totally awesome"" etc attitude which is pretentious and sickening. The attitude of the film is that of Pseudo-Intellectual student/trendy/hipster/cool kid posturing, it was trying too hard to be clever, i couldn't focus on what was going on because the editing and the special effect were giving me a headache, the characters had nothing interesting to say and were (for the most part) horrible people, i couldn't relate or care about them at all and the whole film was messy, unfocused and most of all Uninvolving.I was so full of rage that i felt like i was about to have a panic attack, i was hyperventilating, my whole body was shaking, my knuckles were white from clenching my fists and i felt physically sick! We Just HAD to Walk Out, i was so ANGRY i started screaming in the middle of the street and my hand had a steel like grip over my mouth to try and stop me from swearing on top of my lungs!

I have Never walked out of a screening in a cinema before and its my ultimate golden rule never to do so even if its really bad, i stick with it until the end so i can say i have seen the whole film and i can make a fully informed opinion about it BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN PUT UP WITH!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
one of my favorite movies ever,"This movie is strange. It is not going to be good if you can't accept that it isn't supposed to make sense. Scott Pilgrims alternate version of Toronto runs on video game rules. Everyone seems to be some sort of kung-fu master or have superpowers/magic weapons. At one point, Scott's band summons a giant ape made of lighting simply by playing really well, which then does battle with two giant energy dragons. Yeah.The thing is, the movie is so good because this weirdness is hilarious once you accept it. The fight scenes, even though they were really good action scenes, had me laughing more than any of the jokes because of how ridiculous they are. Speaking of, the jokes are hilarious. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The action scenes are also freaking awesome, especially the final battle.the weirdest thing about this movie is that beneath all the jokes and battles, it is a totally serious and mature movie. It has a lot to say about romance and relationships, but it is kept fun and accessible by processing the serious bits through filters of video games and comic books. Although it slowed down a bit at the end, this movie is meaningful without taking itself too seriously, and I love it. I definitely recommend you go see it. It would be a shame if a movie this good didn't do well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
pure fun served in new ways,"i had a lot of fun watching this movie, so i'm giving 10/10 without any hesitation. it is a very ""today"" movie - very flashy and very pop - and if you wanna let go any back thoughts and simply enjoy it, very much live you'd enjoy some new music band even if someone says it plays along many clichés, but you like it despite that. to me, of course, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" was very innovative. the comics-like format, the funny lines, the likable characters...everything built up am experience that true cinema should provide. we live in times when it is very hard, if not impossible, to create something truly new. so you often find yourself building on what essentially is a stack of clichés. but as in chess a new superb game can be played following a known pattern, in any art, you can still be innovative and creative and productive. ""Scott Pilgrim..."" achieves this. it somehow reminded me of ""Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194530/) which was also fun, and also with and original format. ""Kick-Ass"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/) is also close in presentation and an attempt for novelty. hope for more of these...of course too many would soon create a line of clichés, which we would have to escape by looking for another art, and maybe then you'd look back at these movies and label them pointless clichés, but here and now...the search for love continues :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Bonkers,"It's crazy to think about how many Hollywood stars were in Scott Pilgrim just before they really stepped into their primes as actors. This was a year before Chris Evans played Captain America for the first time, Aubrey Plaza had just begun Parks and Rec, Anna Kendrick was just nominated for an Academy Award that year, Brie Larson hadn't done Room or Short Term 12 yet, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead was finally getting cast in bigger budgeted films. Knowing all of that now, makes going back and watching the film a little bit more fun than it probably should, though it is certainly an entertaining film on its own. That's putting it mildly. For all intents and purposes, Scott Pilgrim is a balls to the wall bonkers comic book adaptation, the kind of film that almost certainly inspired Tim Miller when he adapted Deadpool years later, just purely for its irreverent humor mixed with a heartfelt romance. And much like Deadpool, you either buy into the stylistic choices early on, or you don't. Admittedly, the style does tend to wear off towards the end of it's nearly 2 hour runtime, but I nonetheless had a great time.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
An outstanding piece of work,"Edgar Wright is without a doubt one of the most creative directors working today. Having already done Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, he proves that he's still got the touch with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, an adaptation of the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley. In this film, Scott (Michael Cera) has found the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But unfortunately for him, in order for Scott to date Ramona, he must defeat seven of her evil ex-boyfriends who want him dead.This film is a visual feast. Filled with awesome gags and video game music cues, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one outstanding piece of work, and that's saying something. The cast was awesome.

This movie is non-stop awesomeness.,"This movie is non-stop awesomeness from the moment the time the Universal logo appears at the beginning until ""The End"" appears at the end. You want to laugh hard? See this. You want a love story? See this. You want kick-ass fight scenes? See this. You want great music? See this.Director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and the Brit TV show Spaced) can seemingly do no wrong. The man just doesn't make bad entertainment. He is damn funny (without having to default to humor centered around bodily functions) , has a visionary style and you can just tell that he makes the movies he wants to make, the way he wants to make them, without compromise.Part comic book, part video game, part dream... the cinematic language here is excitingly unique, daring and fun and reminds me of how I felt about Moulin Rouge, Amelie or Fight Club upon first viewings.What really makes the premise work is that no one ever questions the impossible reality of what is occurring. It seems as if they should be asking themselves ""Why can this guy fly and shoot fire from his hands""... but no one ever does. It's just taken as this universe's truth. It achieves the rare balance (these days) of suspension of disbelief and genuineness, prolific use of CGI FX and retention of character and heart.The entire cast shines brilliantly. Everything works exactly as it should. You care about the good guy, you like his sidekicks, you fall in love with the girl, you loathe the bad guys.Some folks may feel they are tiring of the 'Micheal Cera' character, so they may decide to skip this film - and they would be doing themselves a disservice. Micheal Cera has this thing that some actors have in Hollywood which sometimes works for them or against them. Woody Allen is a great example. Woody Allen perfected the 'Woody Allen' character, a character no one else could possibly play, and that character would reliably show up in any movie he appeared in. If you like that character, you are always happy to see him. If you don't, then you'll never like a film he's in, because unlike character actors, he never disappears into a role the role disappears into them.Such is the role of Scott Pilgrim - which seems to have been written with Micheal Cera in mind, because it fits the Cera character to a 'T'. But I think that is where Cera's talent lies. He has the ability to make every moment seem fresh, every word seem as if they are really his words organically pinched from his thoughts in that very moment. He is like a true Zen master, in which whatever arises in every moment is new to him, like a naive young child experiencing things for the 1st time.Great indie band soundtrack including a great new song from Beck, and a geekgasm inducing score based on old 8/16-bit video game music.Go support this movie at the box office so that Edgar Wright can continue to follow his vision wherever it takes him.This is my favorite movie of the summer, maybe even of the year... maybe even of longer than that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Scott Pilgrim wins. Flawless Victory.,"The movie opens with an 8-bit recreation of the Universal Pictures company logo, complete with a new rendition of the studio's fanfare done in nostalgic MIDI format. Ah the good old days of fat video game cartridges that never work until you blow into the microchip slot. For me, this was love at first sight as Edgar Wright (Director, Shaun of the Dead) prepares you for a crazy ride through the trying times of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a young romantic determined to literally fight his way into the heart of his one true love, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). You will find yourself entranced by the dazzling visuals backed by a score made up of head-thumping punk rock and classic video game themes. This truly is an epic of epic epicness.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is adapted from a popular series of graphic novels written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Inspired by punk rock, Manga comics, video games, and Kung Fu classics, this movie is a modern telling of a classic love story, catered to the MTV Generation. That's not to say anyone born outside of this generation won't enjoy the ride. No joke falls flat. Instead they fly at you in vivid color. The movie reads like a comic book and plays like a video game. Like a comic book, the text is an integral part of the storytelling. A series of D's flies out of Scott Pilgrim's bass guitar in rhythmic fashion as he prepares for a killer solo. An occasional onomatopoeia flashes across the screen with a THWOMP or THUNK of someone's head, reminiscent of the Adam West Batman. Like a video game, every bad guy Pilgrim kills spontaneously bursts into coins, accumulating a score that serves no purpose. It's a wacky game of Whose Line is it Anyway where the points don't matter but you find yourself rooting for a winner.I was reminded of Tarantino's Kill Bill. The hero has a list of people to kill, but unlike the Bride, Pilgrim isn't out looking for trouble. The trouble finds him in the form of The League of the Seven Exes, a dark alliance formed by Ramona's latest ex, Gideon Gordon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), whose sole purpose is to challenge any romantic soul brave enough to seek the heart of the impulsive, attractive, and elusive Ramona Flowers. Every ex that Pilgrim encounters offers a different kind of fight, a new challenging way for Scott to win, and another chance for Wright to bring you an entertaining display of light and sound.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World introduces you to a wild ensemble of characters. Scott Pilgrim himself is a scrawny, unassuming young man who seems harmless at first until you discover the impressive track record of broken hearts he's left along the way. One of those broken hearts belongs to the girl drummer in his indy punk rock band, the Sex Bob-Ombs, another endearing Nintendo reference. Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) is his Chinese high school girlfriend, head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend and completely obsessed with his band. Pilgrim's anal sister (Anna Kendrick) and his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin) also offer big laughs.Like Tarantino in Kill Bill, Wright is given a playground with no rules. The fourth wall is almost nonexistent and nobody ever asks why, not the people watching the movie nor the people in the movie. You sit back, suspend all belief, and hope that Scott Pilgrim beats the game. Like Miyamoto's Super Mario Brothers, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a game you will want to play again and again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Bar none, the worst film I've seen all year","To anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie, I tell you to not waste your time. This film is an utter travesty. It is a film crafted for people with thirty second attention spans. If you think that that's a joke... it isn't. Every thirty seconds or so the scenes change and we're in a new location with new people talking about boring things unrelated to the previous events. This film's mere existence is alarming to me. How can this be passed off as entertainment? Apparently though, all the teens in my showing loved it death. No wonder our students are failing to keep up with the rest of the world.So Scott Pilgrim falls in love for a girl (for no good reason) and has to defeat her seven evil ex's to continue dating her (again, for no good reason). You'd think that this would be all about fighting wouldn't you? Well no, because almost all of the fights end on complete deus ex machina anti climaxes. Nothing is riveting, and nothing is exciting. Apart from that, the movie has no sense of internal logic to it. Does this take place in a video game? Maybe it's a comic book world. Do people just always turn into coins when they're murdered? To quote the Nostalgia Critic: ""EXPLAIN MOVIE! EXPLAIN!!!!"" It also doesn't help that the whole affair is so lifeless. None of the actors emote. Never. They just stare into the camera delivering their lines as monotonously as possible. How can we possibly enjoy a movie where none of the characters/actors appear to be having any fun themselves? All in all, this film is a plague. I sincerely hope that it does not do well, because if it does we will have to sit through many year's worth of films imitating this travesty. I hated this movie, and if you go to see it, don't say I didn't warn you.*/*****",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

One thing you'll learn in the beginning itself that it has got a feel of video game, but that's just the start. Half hour in the movie, you'll gonna love it if you are pretty much into games. It may remind you of back years when you used to play them if you're old enough. The style of direction is the wow thing about this movie. The storyline is easily predictable. The acts are fine. All the visual effects are just adequate to manage the feel of a video game. The music is good. Few liners are good including the pac-man one and will make you smile. The co-relation of the movie can be felt if seen deeply as it follows the current code of conduct of the teenagers regarding their life.  Though I strongly feel that its not quite conveyed.

For this type, falling in love is about one moment in time, not minding a sustained flame. They're chasing the spark, that microscopic flutter that accompanies every all-encompassing crush. Eventually, hopefully, they grow out of it and learn that deeper love is about give-and-take, compassion and sacrifice, learning to care about someone else more than you do yourself. I take Scott Pilgrim's arc like that; a dawning realization that hey, I'm not the only person in the world and hey, it sucks to be discarded by someone you still see as the center of the universe. Not sure if my college buddy ever made the same transition.At the start of this story, Scott's a terrible boyfriend. He cheats because he's too cowardly to break up with his significant other, then moans about the awkward conversations to follow. He's a walking, talking relationship vortex until he's swept up in the current of another, more powerful storm. That cyclone is named Ramona Flowers, and her history is so messy she's tailed by ""Seven Evil Exes,"" an assortment of bitter former lovers who seek battle with the new guy. Director Edgar Wright, no stranger to offbeat love tales, leaves room for these brawls to get as wild and crazy as they wanna be, with most fights accompanied by a high-tempo tune from Scott's on-screen garage rock band. It's all presented with oodles of creativity, a great ongoing soundtrack and a striking, one-of-a-kind retro video game aesthetic, but does sometimes get a bit carried away with so many layers of eccentricity. Michael Cera is well-suited for the leading role, all clumsy and weird, with a shockingly rich cast of name actors present to add extra sound and fury.

"An original, smart action-adventure movie","I don't normally say that any movie is a 10 out of 10. Scott Pilgrim however deserves that honor.

a visually stunning anthem to pop culture,"There is something to be said for movies with a tight plot, a realistic approach to the material being filmed, and perhaps a clear message..., or for movies that make us think deeply about certain topics or situations... (as long as they don't devolve into drab, monotonous affairs)""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"", however, has nothing to do with any of those movies, instead it embraces and combines decades of pop culture with a fresh, insouciant approach that never fails to dazzle and entertain from the first minute to the last.The recipe for this particular movie is pretty simple, one part video game, one part comic book (especially manga), one part adolescent comedy, and one part Honk Kong action movie. Add an array of visually stunning special effects, a generous amount of quirky jokes (that at times lovingly satirize the same pop culture the movie celebrates), time it to a steady beat of very enjoyable rock and pop songs, frame it all with creative, well above average camera work and you'll have a final product that plays like a breezy, silly romp through not only pop culture but also the subconscious of generation X survivors.While other visually stunning movies, for instance Avatar, add a ponderous, clichéd, predictable morale, fortunately nothing of the sort interferes with the sheer, mindless fun of this amazing pop opera.Now, it's true that this movie would probably look like an artifact from some distant alien civilization to people in their fifties or older, but I'm in my early forties myself and I could relate to all its elements, as I grew up enjoying all of them, and watching this film was a fun re-visitation of themes that accompanied my childhood, adolescence and maybe even early adulthood, adding a bittersweet element of nostalgia to the viewing experience. Kids still immersed in present pop culture obviously will not experience that, but I seriously doubt they'll fail to enjoy it, as it brings together so many themes they will be easily able to recognize..""Scott Pilgrim"" is not for people who somehow managed to grow up unaffected by pop culture, or high brow connoisseurs that want more than fun from films...... but if the elements of the recipe hold any attraction for you this gem of a movie will surprise you, thrill you and amuse you like few others ever do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A tour de force of cheap nostalgia and creative moviemaking,"For anyone who grew up with the now vintage computer and video games of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a tour de force of cheap nostalgia and creative moviemaking, from the Universal theme of the opening credits and right until the boss fight leaves our protagonist Scott Pilgrim with $7,777,777 coins. Based on the graphic novel series ""Scott Pilgrim"" by Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley, this movie/computer game hybrid creates its own universe and its own set of rules, as director Edgar Wright utilizes a combo of bygone and modern visual effects to weave the two mediums together. The result is often hilarious, even if the story which unfolds is as dumb as the stories from the computer games it draws inspiration from, and even if the performances, even Michael Cera's in the lead, remain one-note. Some great dialogue and a well of funny details keeps the pace and fun up for an hour and a half, before it all drains up in the final part. The filmmakers should have known that this kind of film is doomed to become overlong at nearly two hours, but that doesn't mean the first three quarters of the film can't be viewed again and again, as this is potential cult material.*Review written in 2011.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Review: Scott Pilgrim vs The World,"The Pitch: The Young Person's Guide to Love. (Insert 1 x 50p to play)The Review: Cinema as a medium is threatened, if you believe the popular press. We now prefer to watch movies in our comfy home cinemas and IMAX and 3D are touted as the last hopes of cinema chains keeping people seeing movies where they were meant to be seen. But the thing that will actually keep people coming back is good storytelling, and what the great movies of 2010 are starting to show is that it's the layers of depth of storytelling, and indeed of many other facets of the production, that will get people engaged and keep them returning.Edgar Wright's first two movies have had that feeling of layers, working so well at a broad level but also with the finest details polished and then joined together in often unexpected ways. Other than the obvious directorial touches, though, it's been difficult to tell exactly who contributed what in the two Edgar Wright-Simon Pegg collaborations, so seamless has the join been. What's now abundantly clear is that Wright can blend just as seamlessly with the right material of others as well, and has honed from Bryan Lee O'Malley's comics something that actually feels a level up (if you'll pardon the pun) from his first two movies, unlikely as that may seem. Wright's had a slightly ADD directorial style at times, but one that still fit the vast majority of the material at hand, but here the flourishes are subtle, and ramped up over the course of the running time.What's truly inspiring about Scott Pilgrim is how many different cultural themes are composed into the greater structure. Where Shaun took references from the zombie / horror genres and Fuzz raided action movie lockers and thrillers (with a smidgen of horror thrown in), Pilgrim is a love story to video games, comic books and indie / rock music, among others. As Ang Lee's Hulk proved, translating the visual style of a comic book directly to the screen can go wrong in the best of hands, but the comic book sensibility is retained very effectively, on-screen writing and captions giving a well-structured feel. Somehow, the video game aspects of the comic books form the basis for a visual frame of reference on top of that; as anyone who's played them will know, keeping your interest is nigh on impossible if you can't follow what's happening, but the action is well staged, always clear and progresses effortlessly up through the gears.Through it all, character development is weaved in effortlessly to the tightly plotted but flowing story, and of course O'Malley's titanic contributions should not be understated here, having provided much of the meat, but the central pairing characters get to work through as many relationship issues and combinations as a whole Friends box-set, but in a way that feels refreshingly honest and ultimately powerfully cathartic for anyone that's made any mistakes in the past – which, let's be honest, should be most of us. That Pilgrim the movie covers so much ground in storytelling terms while successfully mining so many layers of modern culture is nothing short of breathtaking.The cast, meanwhile are all pitch perfect and uniformly brilliant, but Cera, Winstead and Culkin should all be proud of what they've done here. Much is always made of Cera's seemingly repetitive performances, but he continues the trend of Youth In Revolt of twisting that persona just a little further each time, to winning effect here. Of the exes, Brandon Routh is a twisted highlight but you'll wish nearly all of them had about three times the amount of screen time, so enjoyable is the company of the characters and the performances. But more than the acting, Wright and his production team have assembled an embarrassment of riches in the craft departments; from musical collaborators including Nigel Godrich and Beck, through Brad Allen's stunt coordination to Bill Pope's cinematography, everyone has raised their game and the final product somehow manages to exceed expectations, which started pretty high.It's the emotional depth, though, that takes this all the way up to the classic level. By the end you'll find yourself rooting for the characters and their eventual fates, and there's a delicious irony that this movie is about growing up when the cultural fabric it's woven from wants us to remain young at heart for ever. Overall, this is just another affirmation that Edgar Wright, in his own way, ranks alongside Christopher Nolan as one of the finest British directors of our times. Continue? Yes, please.Why see it at the cinema: Despite all the above, there is one reservation; as with Shaun and Fuzz, there is probably an entry level for required knowledge to get from it as much as I did, in that knowing nothing about video games or comic books that aren't Spider-Man could hamper your enjoyment here in the same way that not knowing something about zombies or action movie clichés may not allow you get the most from those other movies. But the game-mimicking aspect ratio shifts and extraordinary level of detail really do deserve to be seen on the big screen.The Score: 10 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Fresh, hyper-kinetic and just plain fun","I don't think a movie's quality should be correlated to box office success so I don't care one bit if Scott Pilgrim was a commercial failure. It's still a bold, inventive and very fun film to watch. I'm probably part of the target audience for Scott Pilgrim : male video gamer, geek and in his thirties. That being said, I don't think Scott Pilgrim will appeal only to us. Younger people and especially women will likely love it. Witness the characters who are in their late teens/early twenties yet are much too young to have known the old 8-bit games from the Nintendo Entertainment System era in their heyday (mid-1980s). It bugged me a little, but it's a very minor point. Most of the characters are also cool geeks and far from stereotypical nerds : they're part of indie rock bands or fans, not wearing glasses, more charmingly witty than socially awkward, and more often that not, amazing fighters.This film is a very unconventional action/romance/comedy with strong pop culture sensibilities (video games, comics and mangas mostly). I don't think I've ever experienced something quite like this in cinema, so weirdly it gets major points for originality despite being riddled with references. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. It was a blast to watch and listen to. Visually, it's extremely fresh and dynamic with most sound effects being written on-screen like on a comics page. It might seem annoying, but it worked very well. It has lots of quick cuts (some of the funnier bits coming from stuff appearing out of the blue after a cut) yet everything is easily followable. The fights in particular were very very cool, exciting and spectacular (for geeks : more graceful like Soul Calibur 3 than static like Mortal Kombat). A big part of the humor comes from the one-liners and friendly (or not) banter. It succeeds in doing something very difficult : using intentionally corny lines, bad puns and, by delivery and context, making them sound witty or funny instead of dumb and trite.I think it's my favorite role by Michael Cera, who inhabits that kind of nice, witty, slightly awkward, geek-chic role better than most. But I think the secondary characters are wonderful too and sometimes even steal the show. I loved most of them, especially the very likable and enthusiastic 17-year old Asian girlfriend (so likable you feel sorry and/or root for her) and the wise and promiscuous gay roommate. The main love interest and object of Pilgrim's quest is suitably enigmatic and fascinating. It shows she has baggage and is rather melancholy (almost never smiling). In a brilliant bit of casting, you also get the guys playing Superman (Brandon Routh) and the Human Torch/future Captain America (Chris Evans) as evil ex-boyfriends. I don't know if it's just me but I noticed that eyes in Pilgrim seemed bigger than normal, almost like manga eyes. Kudos to makeup (or special effects ?) for that. The flashbacks with actual drawings from the Scott Pilgrim comics I didn't like as much. They seemed a little out of place, a bit jarring. Scott Pilgrim was a success at entertaining and surprising me constantly. The action was better than expected, the humor was funny, the characters were a joy, the visuals were astounding and the writing was smart. The romantic aspects could have been a bit better, more touching, but were still quite enjoyable. All the geek references were icing on the cake.Rating : 8.5 out of 10 (remarkable)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Like a Herd of Stampeding Bon-Bons,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (1:52, PG-13) — other: comedy; 2nd string; crossoverThis flick was a hoot!""Not so long ago, in the mysterious land of Toronto, Canada, Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler"", we learn in the opening scroll. You get a clue where things are heading when you find that Scott (Michael Cera) is the bassist for the rock band Sex Bob Omb, and that 2 of his bandmates are named Stephen Stills (Mark Webber) and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons). But perhaps you've never heard of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. Not to worry! More in-jokes are on the way, and screenwriters Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright are shooting at the entire side of the barn, so some of them are bound to hit a window you're familiar with.For example, you can still relish the performance of Alison Pill as drummer Kim Pine. Director Edgar Wright gives her almost nothing to do besides glower and provide a downbeat, but she does it with flair, verve, and perfect timing. This is typical of a cast studded with tiny, exquisite short appearances.Sex Bob Omb appears thruout the movie as a framing device, as it is participating in a battle of the bands, and each performance is occasion for some fireworks (both literal and figurative). But the main storyline isn't about this band, or about the other, more successful one, The Clash at Diamondhead, featuring lead singer Natalie ""Envy"" Adams (Brie Larson), one of Scott's ex-girlfriends.No, front and center is the girl of Scott's dreams — she rollerblades thru one — Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), recently arrived from New York with her brilliantly colored hair, gothy good looks, big-city standoffishness, and relationship baggage. She has 7 evil exes (""ex-boyfriends"", Scott keeps calling them; ""exes"", she promptly corrects him) whom he must defeat in hand-to-hand combat if he hopes to win her hand. Ramona has taken a shine to Scott — a typical Ceraesque sweet, slender, minimally talented kid who means well but keeps bumbling and tripping over his own tongue — but, like an ensorcelled princess, she's not a free agent.Complicating things is that Scott has never been particularly adept at relationships. His younger sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick), acting as a kind of Greek chorus, introduces him ""This is my brother. He's chronically enfeebled."", and he's currently taking a lot of ribbing for being 22 years old while that high schooler, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), is only 17. She's clearly smitten with him and tends to cling adoringly; Scott's ready to move on, but Knives isn't, and she's got that nickname for a reason.And so it goes — POW BIFF BAM WHOMP — each development, detail, deranged improbability, and delightful turn of phrase (""flaming katana of love"") coming at you like a herd of stampeding bon-bons. The screen is awash in imagery from comic books and video games, including a digital counter racking up Scott's point totals each time he punches out a foe to the accompaniment of campy freeze-frame BOP words (straight from the Adam West Batman TV series) and a shower of coinage at each victory.It's a never-ending stream of laff-out-loud moments, and anyone who's inclined to take it anywhere near seriously should probably see it only with the benefit of pharmaceutical attitude adjusters.Kudos to the entire fun-filled team, and especially to Bryan Lee O'Malley, who wrote the graphic novels this joyride was based on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Walks a very fine line but just about manages to carry the film with good laughs and a great sense of style and design,"I heard a lot of gushing about this film's originality and brilliance so I approached it with caution. At the same time I was aware that some hated it and that it had underperformed at the box office – and again I had tried to put this out of my mind and just see what it did for me. Having watched it myself I have to agree that I can see the arguments from both sides but only partial agree with either. The film is not awful, but nor is it brilliant – but what it does do is know its intentions really well and all parts of it work to that goal.The end result is a film that will play strongly with target audience and maybe some outside it taken by its freshness, but that will leave many casual viewers cold and perhaps a little hostile to the meaningless bombardment that I imagine some will feel this film is. I understand this because the film walks a very fine line because so much of it is reliant on the style and energy of the delivery and to some, if this doesn't work, then the rest will fall flat. The entire film is wrapped in pop culture but mostly the influence on the design and delivery is that of Japanese animation, comic books and old school video gaming. While the gaming part of it speaks to me most, the rest is delivered with such consistency and energy that I found it refreshing and clever in how it is done.What helps it a lot is that it is all done with real warmth and heart – it is not a cold exercise in mimicking styles, but rather a nice little romantic comedy delivered as such. It is frequently funny and light and, most importantly, the consistency allows it to convince within its own world. Had the film had moments outside of its approach (eg scenes specifically to move the plot forward) then it would have knocked the legs away, revealing that it is ""doing"" this approach rather than ""being"" it. Fortunately it doesn't do it this way and the consistent and note-perfect delivery is really well done, bringing the viewer in and keeping them in this world so those that ""get it"" will not question it.The cast get this too and they are great at matching their director's vision for the film. Cera is strong in the lead and plenty of the material exercises the comic timing and smart wit that fans of Arrested Development loved him for before he became a bit of a pastiche of himself with his many awkward roles. Ramona is the type of girl that would annoy me in real life, but yet Winstead makes me like her (or at least not dislike her). The support cast are generally good and most of the seven ""ex's"" are colourful and bring a lot of fun to their parts. Wright's direction is great though – I would love to see the story boarding for this film just because it was so well done that it must have been planned out to the smallest detail to make it as steady as it was.Scott Pilgrim is not as brilliant as some would have you believe but nor is it as bad as others would try to convince you it is. For target audience it will be like catnip, for those totally removed from the world it uses then it may be awful apart from feeling fresh and energetic. Personally I felt that its short comings were compensated for with how inventive, consistent, enjoyable and warm it all was. Although it is mostly about the style of delivery, it has enough heart and comedy to avoid being a case of style over substance – it is perhaps close, but it is on the right side of the line.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Addicting like an NES game,"Every once in a great while, there comes a movie that makes you so thankful that you saw it in the theaters.

Style Over Substance,"Scott Pilgrim is good fun from director Edgar Wright. The cinematography and visual effects really capture the video game feel of the movie perfectly. That being said, the intended audience for this film seems a little more limited than Wright's ""Cornetto"" trilogy - this movie has created a cult following by the younger generation or anybody who loves classic video games, but the focus on Canadian teenagers and the many homages to video games makes this story less relatable than any of the films in the Cornetto trilogy.Towards the beginning of the story we sympathize with Scott's young girlfriend, Knives, who seems like such a good kid and makes us wonder how Scott can break this girl's hot. Well there's the answer - a mysterious girl Scott's own age with pink hair who he is simply more attracted to and starts stalking (not to an extreme level though). Many references to past girlfriends, however, makes us wonder how Scott is such a stud since he is played by Michael Cera.The premise is interesting and is obviously video-game-inspired: defeat Ramona's seven evil exes to continue dating her. The way this plot is revealed does not seem forced either, as Scott is unexpectedly attacked by the first ex while he is still juggling Knives and Ramona and has no idea what is going on.Aside from the great action sequences littered with jokes and references to video games, the overall humor of the film is its greatest highlight. Michael Cera may be quirky and a bit of a geek, but it is in a lovable manner. Scott's roommate is gay, but not just for the sake of being gay - he is able to turn straight guys gay with little explanation, and it is also funny to see Scott and him to share the same bed (mattress) making us question Scott's sexuality.Even the supporting cast is well cast with big names like Mae Whitman and Chris Evans, who each prove to be great caricatures for Scott/Ramona to fight. Chris Evans' scene may be the best scene of the whole film - he plays his part perfectly and draws big laughs as an overly macho actor.What this film lacks is great substance. It may be a great romantic comedy for its comedy, but the romance is not well-executed. Not only that, but the film constantly makes the audience question which girl Scott should pursue, Knives or Ramona, and it seems odd that Scott would go to such great lengths to ""save"" Ramona when Knives seems to be the better person by default. The only gratification that comes from Scott wanting to break up with Knives is the fact that he no longer has a creepy relationship (she is only 17). But in early scenes within the film, no matter how creepy this relationship, it is clear the two were made for each other. Oh well.Scott Pilgrim vs The World immerses the audience in its great style, but the story is hindered by its lack of substance.3.0/4.0",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Funny, Fizzy & Freakish In All Ways Imaginable.","Sprinting at such high velocity & packing so much dynamic energy that it feels like being hit by an express train, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World travels from its source to destination in just one gear: top. A highly charged & vividly animated roller-coaster ride, it is as exhausting as it is entertaining, as frustrating as it is amusing, and as nonsensical as it is high on adrenaline.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World tells the story of its titular character, a 20-something slacker musician who is yet to recover from his previous breakup, is dating a high-school student & falls in love with the new girl in town. Soon after, he learns that in order to date his latest crush, he will have to fight & defeat her seven evil exes, each seemingly more powerful than the other.Written & directed by Edgar Wright, the movie picks up speed almost as soon as it begins and then rides on this swiftly gained momentum for the remainder of its runtime. Wright unfolds the story as if swiftly skimming through a tale, and the only way to enjoy this ride is by allowing yourself to be swept by its tide. It's full of life, full of vigour & full of passion but it isn't a film for all.Set pieces are utilised in a way as if breathing life into comic book pages, the swift manoeuvring of camera & exuberant use of colours only ends up adding more vibrancy to its images. Music plays a key role in every segment and keeps things alive at all times. But there are also times when it ends up overdosing itself with too much oddity, plus not all its attempts at humour hit the right spot.Coming to the performances, the film packs a colourful cast, many of whom would later go on to make a name for themselves. The eponymous character is played by Michael Cera but he's easily overshadowed by others, namely Mary Elizabeth Winstead & Brie Larson who chip in way better as his future & ex girlfriend respectively. Best of all, however, is Kieran Culkin who play his roommate.On an overall scale, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is funny, fizzy & freakish in all ways imaginable, and is guaranteed to garner a devoted fan following but its uncontrolled zest & sharp tonality may turn out to be either too much or too less for those who are looking for something bit more meaningful here.

It's jam-packed with awesome fight sequences and hilarious jokes. You'll feel as if you're in a comic book. 12 years later however the main plot however doesn't really hold up well. Now don't get me wrong its great stylisitically but when we come to the main story it shows us how much societal norms has changed in the last decade. This movie was also released during the whole nerd guy rom-com phase so you can totally see how this movie is so critically acclaimed. If I had been a mind numbing fun it might have been but that's just me i guess.Characters:: The cast are studded with Hollywood A listers. It's amazing to watch so many actors in the same movie and you realise where they've come to now and feel the whole surreal-ness. Like this movie has Anna Kendrik, Aubre Plaza, Brie Larson and none of them are the main female lead is mind blowing and yet it makes me proud to think how much they've grown. And let me get it out of the way but I just love Mary Elizabeth Winstead, she's so good. She has been given to play a cool aloof character to play and she plays it to the T. I probably fell in love with her again. Michael Cera is in the center of it and you know Michael Cera plays the character of a nerd who's in a rock band and stuff. Still surprising how a tall lanky nerd got to score with some many women but alright. I guess that's just 2010 self insert.Sound:: oh the music in this movie is just perfect. I loved it from start to finish. How well it could match up with this over the top story is unbelievable. The band songs where so good and eventhough the lyrics are meh but the beat and the composition is good you'll have to head bob all the way.It's fun movie. Don't watch it if you have a lot of important problems in your own life. This is just supposed to be ""Shut your mind and have fun"" movie. Don't think too much and let the anime + games aesthetic draw you in.I also wanna say that the anime style cinematography was so well done here and its incredible to think this was 12 years ago.I recommend to watch it once as its an all time classic, with all your favourite actors in the same movie with amazing story and music for an awesome movie night with friends.Thanks for reading.

What if life were a video game?,"One of my favorite movies, and one of the better adaptations of a graphic novel I've seen. Although of course they had to condense a lot of stuff, which lead to necessary changes, it felt like the same story. I was worried it would feel limited, because there are things you can do on paper that you can't do in a movie, but they utilized sound and action well, while keeping that comic book feel.It lost a couple points only because I felt like the ending suffered a bit...I know the comics were still coming out when the movie was being produced, so even the author didn't have the ending perfectly figured out, but I thought Ramona didn't get to be as awesome in this version as she was in the comic. Also, much as I love him, Michael Cera's Scott wasn't the same Scott that was in the book; it worked, and I still liked his interpretation, but it was an odd casting decision.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Endlessly Inventive,"WHAT'S SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD ABOUT? A geek must battle his girlfriend's exes for her heart. Literally battles them.IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: B) Director Edgar Wright has directed and co-written two of my all-time favorite comedies, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The appeal of his work lies in both the originality of his direction (even the film editing is funny) and in the sharpness of his screenplays. His latest, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, represents a step up for Wright as a director, but sadly, it's also a step down for him as a screenwriter. In terms of visuals and sound, Scott Pilgrim is one of the most creative films of the past decade, and I don't mean merely in a ""Wow, that CGI looks cool!"" kind of way. The film-making itself is endlessly inventive as Wright blends the styles of comic books, video games, and rock n'roll into a charming love letter to geek culture.Michael Cera (Arrested Development, Juno) successfully stretches a bit beyond playing the affable, clueless nice guy role he's made a career out of. Those elements are still there, but so is an edge of selfishness and, ultimately, growth. What's more, he impresses with speed, flexibility, and coordination in the film's many fight scenes. He also really plays the guitar in the musical scenes, impressively shredding it up.The plot, as it is, finds amateur guitarist Scott Pilgrim having to battle the ""seven evil exes"" of his new girlfriend, who is quite literally the girl of his dreams (played by Live Free or Die Hard's Mary Elizabeth Winstead). In the mix are a gay roommate, an Asian high-school girlfriend (one of the film's highlights), a movie star (Captain America's Chris Evans), a super-powered Vegan (Superman Returns' Brandon Routh), a trail of broken hearts, and a battle of the bands. It's fun stuff, but a film this intentionally silly needs two things to blossom: more laughs and a shorter running time. Scott Pilgrim clocks in at nearly two hours; it should be about 20 minutes shorter, and the pacing lags in spots.What's more, while the film is quite funny, it is neither as clever nor as packed with humor as Wright's previous movies. Too many jokes fall flat, perhaps because too many revolve around Scott's roommate and his sex life. I have no problem with sympathetic portrayals of LGBT characters, but the character isn't well-rounded. His sexuality gradually becomes his only defining characteristic. Also, Scott's relationship with the female lead goes from zero-chemistry awkwardness to physical intimacy without any transition in between. I know the film wasn't striving for realism, but even by movie standards, that was a stretch. Though there is entertainment and ingenuity to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there are also some flaws and, depending on your tastes, potentially offensive content.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Fantastic visuals and ideas...,"An absolutely beautiful experience, with amazing visuals! Edgar Wright and his team cleary put a lot of effort into the editing/cinematography. Each scene is packed with little jokes or small features that really add to the film. I don't think I can even name a film with a similar style.The acting is quite good, most of the actors manage to pull off some truly strange dialogue very well. However, sometimes I feel the editing can be a little confusing. At the beginning I felt I had to really pay close attention to every detail to understand whether the character was dreaming or not. Wright definitely perfected this style of editing in his future films.The visuals and effects are my personal favourite part of the film, being the thing I will return to the film for. Certainly worth a watch for videogame and film fans!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
More wish-fulfilment for nerds.,"My nerd credentials are reasonably high—I have a comic book collection; I go to movie conventions; I possess one or two T-shirts bearing pop culture slogans and graphics; and I obsessively review cult films on IMDb—but I'm still nowhere near qualified enough to connect with Scott Pilgrim vs The World, a film that proudly enters the realm of the über-nerd, a plane of existence where Manga is king, Japanese vinyl toys are objects of desire, retro video games are cool, web programmers are gods, and designing and building your own PC is the mark of a true man.The hero of this film is a pale, scrawny wimp, the kind of guy whose awkward appearance would normally condemn him to a lifetime of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. In director Edgar Wright's nerd-centric universe, however, Scott Pilgrim is an aspirational figure: his entire existence is played out in video game/graphic-novel mode, with FX lettering and motion lines accompanying his every move; he's a bass player in a rock band; he possesses awesome fighting skills; and seriously cute/smoking hot girls find him irresistible (he even dates the gorgeous Mary Elisabeth Winstead—talk about punching above your weight!!!). In short, he is the ultimate geek icon.For those who closely identify with the guys in The Big Bang Theory, this film is going to be the stuff of dreams, the ultimate fantasy come true, thus earning itself a dedicated fan-base; in time, it might even make its money back from the lucrative 'dweeb dollar'. But to anyone who has even the vaguest semblance of a life within the real world, it's endless geek subculture references, heavily stylised and often surreal action, incessant use of game-speak, and elevation of obnoxious loser to hero status will seriously grate on the nerves.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Amazing but characters could have been a bit better.,"To start out, I gotta just say what all I love about this movie. First there's the title card and all the awesome music throughout the movie. Then amazing graphics and the little details in each scene. And the last big one for me is the crazy cool use of cuts that speed the story along while never losing momentum.This movie is just plain phenomenal and I only have one gripe that spoils it a bit. The one issue I have is just that Scott and Romona aren't particularly good together. It never feels like they have real chemistry and the big revelation at the end about their relationship and who they are as individuals doesn't feel like it was built up to very well.But overall it's an amazing experience to watch this crazy awesome movie! Definitely check it out!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One of the best films of it decade,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a fun movie and an excellent guide to overcoming baggage from your significant other (or so l'm told). While the movie did feel a little long, it's a blast to watch - as long as you don't take it any more seriously than it takes itself. If you're not familiar with the movie or story, be prepared for a film unlike anything you've ever seen. After that, sit back and enjoy the ultimate video game coming-of-age story of all time. The plot behind this bizarre tale is based on the seven volume independent developed graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley in which Scott Pilgrim runs into the girl of his dreams Ramona Flowers but Ramona is carrying more baggage then Scott is used to. Baggage in the form of seven evil exes; (I say exes since Ramona had six ex boyfriends and one ex girlfriend this is the 21st century after all) So Scott must defeat all her exes in order to be with Ramona and this is where it gets weird. For reasons unquestioned and unexplained by anyone Scotts world seems to inhabit the world of video game logic. All said characters seem to have some sort of super power or magical weapon, they go head to head in video game boss fight / fighting game style, with a system that keeps score gives one ups and where the loser bursts in a shower of coins. All this may sound like it panders to a certain audience, and it does on top of the evil ex fights the movie is filled with references and sound effects thrown in from a generation of video games. But I still feel that this a movie that people outside the video game trend can watch. What I find to be Scott Pilgrims biggest strength is how self aware it is with its absurd premise; It continually knows through out that this is a silly prospect for a movie so it plays more for laughs then to be taken straight faced. Almost every line of dialogue is building up to a punch line or just being intentionally funny, even the fights are there for comedy rather then tension. But I don't mean to undersell the fight scenes they are still awesome to watch amongst all the hilarity going on. All this may sound like it panders to a certain audience, and it does on top of the evil ex fights the movie is filled with references and sound effects thrown in from a generation of video games.

It's Weird. It's Unique. It's Great.,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a sensory masterpiece. The film is pure fun, creative, and full of satisfying action. This is how graphic novel adaptations should be done!Disclaimer: I never read the graphic novel of the same name so my review may be biased.The first thing that caught my eye about this movie is how ORIGINAL it is. Scott Pilgrim is a fun, stylish movie that's steeped with comic book and video game culture. Sprinkle a bit of ""randomness-rawr"" comedy and you have a movie that epitomizes the late 2000s culture. But the cringeness holds some of the best parts. This movie is full of clever one-liners and natural jokes that keep this film rewatchable.Transitions from one scene to another are seamless and keep the momentum going. Fighting sequences are always fresh as different exes have their own distinct style. It's hard to know what to expect jumping from one scene to another.Did I mention the eye-catching effects? It feels as if you are in the middle of a video game/comic book. Musical performances were also quite enjoyable.And the cast is absolutely A+. I was surprised at some of the cameos that this film had. Also, leave it up to Michael Cera to play the part of awkward Scott Pilgrim to perfection.Yet this film did have some flaws. I found that Ramona's character was reduced to damsels in distress with little say in the film. I was also disappointed that Knives' character arc did not turn out the way I was expecting.Still, this is one of Edgar Wright's most memorable works.4/5.Well Done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"For a sweet, funny video game-style action thrill ride, Scott Pilgrim makes the score","It's funny, it's clever, it's undeniably sweet, and it all comes from the pages of Bryan O'Malley's hit graphic novel series of the same name. This romantic action comedy is not your average romantic comedy, it is a subversive action comedy that shuttles far from the usual rom-com conventions. Director Edgar Wright, following the success of 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', orchestrates an electrifying love story with a style that echoes the works of comic books. Blending the action with subtle humor, clever pop culture references, and video game-style elements; this movie pulls viewers in for hyper-kinetic, stylized fun from beginning to end. And the main figure in the film's spotlight is charming comedic star Michael Cera, stepping in the shoes of the eponymous character. Set in Toronto, Canada, this film star Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, a 22- year old slacker who's life consists of playing guitar with his band known as Sex Bob-Omb and sharing an apartment with his gay roommate Wallace (played by Kieran Culkin). While dating an underage Asian girl named Knives (played by Ellen Wong), Scott fantasizes about a hot American girl named Ramona Flowers (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Upon meeting her at a party, Scott forms a relationship with her while dumping his Asian girlfriend in the process. Their relationship quickly becomes disrupted however, when Ramona's seven evil ex-lovers are targeting him. With his relationship with Ramona at stake, Scott must defeat her seven ex-lovers in a series of comic book-style battles in order to win her heart.This movie is a sweet romantic comedy that takes its genre and polishes it with a shockingly creative twist that is likely to win the hearts of a much larger demographic. Unlike most romantic comedies which often nowadays slip in the cracks of formula and corniness, this entry pedals on a radical execution that transcends an average love story into a cartoon-style battle of good versus evil. As eccentric as this concept sounds, Edgar Wright makes diligent effort to make this one work. Opening with the Universal Pictures logo pinned an 8-bit fanfare, this film sets the character in a world incorporated with video game elements including a soundtrack from the 'Legend of Zelda' series which makes it way a dream sequence. The concept however, plays a major role in the hyper-kinetic fighting sequences when the titular character is force to face down against the former lovers of his new girlfriend. With animated heads-up display popping on screen and retro video game sound effects playing, these action sequences deliver pulse-pounding thrills that not only intend to keep viewers glued to their seats but serve as love letters for the video-game nerds. The sequences and the story itself move at a solidly fast pace, and there is rarely a moment that is wasted here. Although the caricature style of the action will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea, it sets out to be entertaining and not be taken seriously.Michael Cera makes a reasonable impression in the eponymous role. Suiting in his typical awkward teenager typecasting, Cera gives a charismatic portrayal of the titular character, sparkling the role with charm and humor. His quirkiness makes a match for his lover Ramona Flowers who is beautifully portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. While her bold performance stands well, the real driving force behind her romance with Michael Cera is not their cold chemistry but his desperate will to win her heart no matter what it takes to do so. The duo share a good amount of comedic bond with humor and dialogue that veers in the realm of subtly. Easily one of their most witty scenes takes place when Ramona metaphorically says ""we all have baggage"" and Scott responds ""Yeah, well my baggage doesn't try to kill me ever five minutes"", lines that shed small light in each of the characters's pasts with ex- lovers. Meanwhile, the story is driven the action between Scott and Ramona's ex-lovers which include a cast of Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzmann, Mae Whitman (Yes, a girl), Brandon Routh, Satya Bhahba, and a duo of Chinese actors -- most of which get a nice swipe at some clever humor. The rest of cast including Johnny Simmons, Kieran Culkin, Mark Webber, Anna Kendrick, and Alison Pill make good use of their screen time; nothing more, nothing less.Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a sweet, funny, video game-style comedy polished with plenty of stylized action and brainy humor, and makes for an entertaining testament to Bryan O'Malley's source material. Edgar Wright embraces an over-the-top cartoony style, and makes surprisingly good use with it. And for those who believe only video game fans or teen rom-com fanatics will find appeal out of this, think again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Still, it was nice to see him branch out into something a little different for at least part of this film.I was glad to see that a lot of the more adult themes (which I thought put the books out of the ""Teen"" range) were cut for the film (more sex and homosexuals mainly).

When it became known that the master of English humor Edgar Wright,"When it became known that the master of English humor Edgar Wright would not invite the duet that brought him immense popularity to his next comedy, many moviegoers took this news with hostility. Moreover, as the basis of the picture, the director of ""Type of tough cops"" and ""Zombie named Sean"" took a series of Canadian comics. However, all doubts should have been discarded even at the production stage, since Mr. Wright always made a brilliant combination of reality and fiction the main highlight of all his films. This film was no exception, in which he tried to connect two worlds - reality and imagination. This time Edgar decided to play with us a game called ""What if ..."". And what came out of this venture? Yes, it worked out well. At least I enjoyed watching it. The plot turned out to be quite interesting, sometimes unexpected and, most importantly, well thought out. Although, of course, it could be better. But this is a question for the writers.""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" surprises with the swiftness of its plot, it feels like one moment and you no longer understand what is happening. I think this is the genius of the film and the reason for its failure at the box office. This way of narration is not for the aspen layer of viewers. The main viewer does not want to delve deeply into what is happening and also quickly run along the plot thread, as the film requires.What is that speed?In everything, in every little thing that happens on the screen. This, and smooth transitions through objects in the frame, and funny inscriptions that pop up out of nowhere, and pseudo-clumsy effects in which you can see every pixel. All together, it gives such a strong charm that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with the picture.But the film would not have caused that very vivid feeling of genuine admiration, if not for the excellent musical accompaniment, which fully complements the complete immersion in the atmosphere of the film: the world of rental housing, bad companies, second-hand shops and cheap cafes.

They were picked out perfectly for this movie.What disturbed me at this movie was the amount of video game stuff involved. Seriously, with every single ex that Scott was battling, there was some sort of special powers involved, and we've seen some sort of a battle as we would see it in 'Mortal Kombat'. Not to mention all the people turning into coins when being defeated. Probably that is because the movie is based on a comic book? Anyhow, leaving such stuff out of the movie would certainly raise my vote up to at least an eight.Overally, it's definitely still a great movie, and I'm already looking to see a few more works of Edgar Wright.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

It's edgy, subtle, sublime video gamey, comicy stuff. A decent and clever adaptation even if some of the magic and spirit of the comics is lost, but I guess something else is gained; The cast for example and the creative editing and the library of sound effects and visual references from my past.
The film manages to say something about possessive ex partners, baggage, the human condition and growing up. Pilgrim is like no one I've ever seen on film; a narcissistic, weak, lucky, sneaky, cowardly, loveable sociopath and I've met and befriended a ton like him. Not all of them learn the self respect to treat other people better like Scott does.

May be the most surprising film you see all year,"From Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz), a fresh director with his finger on the comedic pulse, comes Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, an original, unconventional and interesting meld of several genres you wouldn't expect to work well in conjunction with one another, but actually complement each other nicely to produce a very entertaining two hours.Socially-awkward-but-somehow-a-woman-magnet Scott Pilgrim is the bassist for aspiring band Sex Bo-bomb, who meets the mysterious Ramona Flowers once in his dream, then again during a live show. They hit it off, but before the relationship can get serious he must defeat her seven evil ex's (not just limited to ex-boyfriends, either). Intertwined within all this is his current girlfriend Knives, who takes action into her own hands in this unlikely game of cat-and-mouse.If you wanted to make things really simple, and tried hard enough, you could look at any single film and justify which two films that came before it are, in fact, its illegitimate parents. This much is true for Scott Pilgrim. It combines the offbeat, new age & contemporary humour of Mean Girls with the bizarre, risk-taking cinematic style seen in Natural Born Killers. Many of its similarities to the former can be attributed to what is at least a half-decent screenplay, and definitely the most ambitious script of any film currently out. Writers Bacall and Wright employ quick wit and, although many of the jokes do possess a hit-or-miss factor, much of the humour is well constructed whether it be a case of art imitating life, or some insane set piece involving superpowers and epic battles.As for the latter, there is no doubt in my mind that this film took as much inspiration from Oliver Stone's twisted fairytale as it did from the Scott Pilgrim comic itself. The entire film is essentially a video game come to life, with a heap of fourth-wall-breaking, self-reflexive techniques that, for all their simplicity, have never been seen before on such a mainstream level. Honourable mentions must go to Scott's 'battle' with second evil ex Lucas Lee, as well as an excellent scene referencing Seinfeld, displaying the theme music, conversational tone and plot of the show briefly for no other reason than to entertain.The film did have its negatives, and I'll start with the most pressing issue: Michael Cera. Here we have an actor who, in his few years in the industry, has become typecast like no other actor before him. Once again, he plays the nervous, wimpy teenager; the only difference being his character is actually 22. He is not necessarily terrible in Scott Pilgrim, but his performance suffers tremendously from its stale aftertaste, mainly because we've seen it all before.Also, some people may take offence with the implied moral of this film. A friend who didn't enjoy the film for this reason (among others) actually summed it up quite well: 'cheating on your girlfriend is OK if the new one is hot enough.' Personally, I'm all about suspending disbelief while watching a movie and judging it on its on-screen efforts, rather than criticizing the way in which some people may interpret it wrongly. But, as mentioned, this can be an issue, and so had to be raised accordingly. However, if you appreciate innovation and directors who think outside the box, actually making the effort to make a film stand out as one of their own, I recommend Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

However this movie had a lot of freshness to it.The characters are interesting were I could not look away when Scott and Ramona were on. I think this movie has so much going for it fresh / cool / hip/ true to teens ( and older) / I think anybody can appreciate the epic -ness ( if thats a word ) / humor / wacky / unique and many more words could describe the movie.Cera and Winstead did an amazing job.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the world,"""Scott Pilgrim"" is a unique and peculiar individual. This movie is a very chaotic movie with animated onomatopoeia's. This movie is really not my cup of tea, don't get me wrong it was a funny movie and I enjoyed watching it but this movie is most likely a better choice for teens that like video games and like graphic novels. This movie is about Scott pilgrim who is in a band with his friends and gets girls after girls, he meets a girl named Ramona, who has a very long past. Scott ends up falling in ""Lesbian"" ;) with Ramona and has to fight her long past to ""keep"" her. Ramona and Scott have some issues during their adventure of love. Most people say if its meant to be, it will be.I.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Made for 20-somethings, and not all of them!","Scott Pilgrim came out when I was 25 years old. As a child I had a Nintendo and a Sega. I read comics and I played games like Street Fighter, Zelda and Sonic the Hedgehog. Upon watching this movie, all I could notice was how much of my childhood seemed to be referenced, used, and often exploited! But in a good way, a really good way.Pilgrim is at its heart a coming of age story. Our main character acts like a child, takes no responsibility in his actions and is 100% self-centred. How this makes him a likable hero is largely because he is so human. I often compare him to the legendary ""Dude"" from The Big Lebowski. Both characters are hugely likable because they remind us so much of ourselves, each of us has moments of selfishness and laziness but like the characters also value our friends and our own morality. Scott, despite cheating on his girlfriend, constantly complaining and letting his band down, remains very appealing because we care about his redemption - and how do the film makers do this? By throwing in literally everything from our childhoods to make his story seem like a supercharged, action packed version of our own experiences of becoming an adult.There is no logic to this film. Scott despite his mostly normal behaviour is magically blessed with fighting abilities, super strength, endurance and a slew of other super human abilities.. No explanation is given or is needed. No characters in the movie comment on this. Part of this films charm is how it absorbs you into its world of seemingly normal super human feats - all of them very cool, flashy and somehow reminding you of your 10 year old self dreaming of being a ninja!This is why I can understand people not liking this movie, it was made 100% for people who, as children, grew up with arcade style video games as shown in little gags like Scott's ""pee meter"" or getting an ""extra life"". These gags are not subtle or clever, they are face value jokes that the audience is supposed to laugh at. Scott and his friends seemingly amazing powers are basically the imagination of a child and this is anything but a subtle movie. Its large IN YOUR FACE style is very reminiscent of the early 90's when everything was EXTREME! Its references to what was recently called ""nerd"" culture are very modern. There are little to no references to Star Wars, Star Trek or anything considered classic ""nerd"" appeal, literally everything is from the late 80's/early 90's onwards, IE its audience's childhood.For a film that seemed tailor made to suit my viewing demography, naturally I loved it. A particular ""nerd"" moment for me was when Scott proudly proclaimed ""Hey I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy II!"" which would mean literally nothing to someone who has never heard of the Final Fantasy video game series. I can only be impressed with this film's decision to appeal to a relatively narrow section of the audience, as so many films go for the catch-all approach and usually end up being terrible.I can see this film easily becoming a classic, along with the likes of The Big Lebowski and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Those films were received poorly at their release and have become ""cult"" classics, and I feel as we grow older and more nostalgic this film will become even more appreciated by us 20-somethings, and maybe even a new generation will find its ""retro old school-ness"" appealing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Review of ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World""","Director Edgar Wright brings Bryan Lee O'Malley's famed comic book character to life with ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"". The movie, of course, tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Cera), a young musician who must battle all the evil exes of the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Winstead). First off, try not to take this movie too seriously - because it's not. If you walked into this movie expecting a tour-de-force tale of love, passion, and perseverance you'd be sorely mistaken. This movie is not meant to be thought-provokingly philosophical. It's meant to be fun - and boy is it fun. I had a pretty darn good time watching ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"". The most entertaining quality of this movie is it's special effects. Granted most of it's CGI, it doesn't hinder the entertainment value. I only wish I would've seen this movie on the big screen - it would've been exponentially more fun to watch. Another great quality of the film is that it features a wealth of tongue-in-cheek throwbacks to some of the classic video games of the late 80s and early 90s. A lot of video game clichés make their appearance in this movie and I (being a nerd) found them highly entertaining to spot. The acting is what it is. It's not really anything worthy of note, but it fits the bill for the overall tone of the movie. The same goes for the script, which, for most of the movie, should not be taken seriously. Wright also employed a lot of CGI to really make the film feel like a comic book. I feel that a lot of these techniques were really fresh, innovative, and even, at times, funny. In the end, Edgar Wright's ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" remains an impressively entertaining adaption of the popular comic book series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The first movie I was embarrassed to watch,"..and still I've watched it till the ending credits.Some of my friends recommended this movie saying how cool it was and how ""the crowd"" was not getting it so it's not for everyone. Turns out the crowd is the smart side here.First the good part - from the technology and CGI point of view - it's done extremely well, visuals and sound effect fit perfectly. Too bad it would be more entertaining to use those effects on a video of a dog taking a dump (that movie would definitely have more character development).The plot (and I'm very brave to use this word here) can be described in half a sentence but I'll not spoil it (cause it's impossible, pun intended). Character development is non-existent as I've previously noted and the whole setting is far far away from reality.Video games themselves (their 8-bit style is heavily featured here) have been moving away from this type of presentation and more into reality and SPvtW perfectly sows us why - many video games right now are more thoughtful, engaging and a better representation of art than this movie. Seriously, if you play all evening on your couch - you'll be a better person afterward than if you choose to watch SPvtW.P.S. I'm off to finding and downloading some transformer-Pokémon crossover hentai, because it would be less embarrassing to get caught watching that.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Pretty enjoyable,"Despite this movie being my only extent of the Scott Pilgrim franchise, I still found it quite fun to watch. Granted I do have some complaints that I will further discuss in a moment, but I think it is still worth the watch.In terms of positive attributes, I don't really have much to say.As far as quality and budget, it holds up quite well and gives off the impression of like a fun indie project that happened to have a AAA budget. The editing and special effects were neat with nothing particularly standing out while still meeting the threshold to be convincing. And as far as the story, it's a pretty cool concept with some interesting characters alongside a fairly simple plotline.That being said, I do dislike a few things. One of which being the the characters. Now as much as I love Wallace, a bunch of the characters just annoyed me; most notably, Scott himself. He is too cliché and his entire story just makes me cringe from second-hand embarrassment. Furthermore, I find that the plot and order of events was almost too simple, sort of seeming like it was written by a middle schooler. Just fight scene after fight scene.Lastly on my list of complaints are actually the special effects themselves. Even though I stated that they had the budget of your typical AAA title, the directors' ideas of what videogames are like just felt outdating. I found it quite similar to a movie such as Pixels. Just made me confused on whether or not that was their goal.Anyway, even though I have some gripes, it's still a pretty sound movie that I think is worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Awesome, Quirky, and Engaging... Just Edgar Wright Being His Edgar Wright Self","In this incredibly stylistic comic book superhero comedy, ""Scott Pilgrim"" a young adult who in order to court one ""Ramona Flowers""(an American who is running from her past) is tasked with fighting her ex-boyfriends.Edgar Wright executed every single part of this film perfectly starting with the writing, this film had a very unique style that all kicked off with the perfect first narrated line ""Not so long ago... In the mysterious land... Of Toronto, Canada... Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler"" which set the tone for the truly original narrative to come. The story is equally matched with an editing style that is well suited to the story furthering the narrative, and I think it is crucial to mention his inventive transitions which shows Edgar Wrights extraordinary vision in the pre-production process. Casting is another category where this movie exceeds, Now I know that many people have developed a stigma around Michael Cera labeling him a character actor who plays the lovable all American nerd, but this should not diminish the fact that his awkward stage presence fitting his role. Besides he played a Canadian character.Now I must admit that I am a huge admirer of Edgar Wright and all his work, but I find that he is very consistent in always creating an enjoyable viewing experience without ever repeating himself, and it is for that reason that I chose to give this movie an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs My Patience,"I loved the first 1/3 of this film. Meeting Scott and his off-beat pals thru a skewered lens set to comic book crazy. This unique visual take on the rom com is courtesy of game boy but didn't lose its sense of fun and reality: These characters are not so far off as to be unreal. Cera and company are (at core) really likable and I would have liked the whole film to stay firmly rooted in Scott's romantic ambitions. And there's enough inside humor to keep the non-game playing public amused as well. But the film's lengthy plot about conquering seven evil exes just got tiresome and frenetic. I could have done with several fewer exes and more about the core cast. Maybe a ""Scott Pilgrim"" TV series would solve that problem? Maybe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

The style is amazing as well. The video game and comic book like visuals, the color, etc.The music is also great! My three favorite songs in the movie are: garbage truck, under my thumb, and teenage dream. The songs sound great and fit the scenes perfectly.The actors are undeniably funny and surreal as well.

Nearly all style and no substance...,"There is a lot to be admired in Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim. The quirky visuals, the pop culture references and his inventiveness with the conventions of mainstream cinema -which have all become a visual trademark of Wright's directorial style - are all here in abundance. In this respect the film is a visual treat; the special effects are impressive and used effectively; the stunts and set pieces are well handled and the mixing up of various genres lends the film a pleasant eccentricity.So far so goodWhat the film lacks however, is heart. As impressive as the visuals are, there's just something missing which meant I found myself unable to connect with the film in any meaningful way. What made Wright's previous outings Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz so good -apart from the visual inventiveness, was the sharp script and the great comic performances from Pegg and Frost. Whilst there's no one better at playing the sensitive loser in love character than Michael Cera, I'm not sure how long he can keep this up, we've seen it all before and it's wearing a bit thin now, and as a result it's hard to really care about the central character.The film has good intentions with regards to human relationships but it is ultimately let down by a script which falls short of any genuine sincerity. In the end the film is carried by the strength of its visuals, and its overall genre mixing quirkiness, which is not a bad thing but it could have been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A fresh burst of comedic brilliance mixed with the comic book genre that left a mark on my movie loving heart,"A fresh burst of comedic brilliance mixed with the comic book genre that left a mark on my movie loving heart. Edgar Wright leaves every jaw dropped with this peculiar masterpiece of a flick. In combination with: the impressive use of letterboxing to enhance dramatic scenes; flawless VFX that although never realistic, added to the overall style; clever, childish (for lack of a better word) sound sound effects; and Edgar Wright's brilliant scene transitions that merged each and every action; the constant cartoonish style was amazingly executed and gave plenty more than it took. In addition, the pacing was sensationally expeditious, being vehemence and in doing so fashioning the final 'boss battle' and most of the movie to feel that of a video game. Dialogue was seamless and overall clever, sentences streamed from one to another as witty remarks were thrown from character to character. And with help from that, the characters felt perfectly entrenched in this world far before the plot called for them. All characters were perfectly casted, Michael Cera of course nailing the performance of Scott, who although nerdy and odd, had a strange charm that aided in connecting to him as the protagonist. The humour was absolute comedic genius, a joke never overstayed its welcome and every humourous moment could either give you a small smile, a slight chuckle or send you bursting into tears of laughter. The fight choreography put modern day fight scenes to shame as every battle handled more as a dance than a conflict, giving the audience more to enjoy rather than to endure. This movie is a complete masterpiece in my eyes, bringing a fresh take to comedy and bringing something we never knew we needed on film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I think it is always impressive when a film feels so cohesive, and this movie does that. The plot is wild and the world thats been created in the universe isn't the same as reality, which really works for the life of Scott Pilgrim.

Where does the 8 out of 10 come from?,"Right from the beginning, I had trouble watching this movie; the movie is simply just boring. The only thing that actually kept me awake was a box of popcorn and the constant really fake fighting scenes, where there was no blood until someone was slashed by a sword. Anything supposedly funny in the whole movie, I did not laugh to at all and the story was not entertaining in the least, which was the only thing I expected from the movie: comedy. There is just no point to the story, and it was in no way memorable. The acting was also terrible, as no one was convincing as their character. Perhaps it's just that I find a stupid movie made to look like a comic book (a comic book I would never read)uninteresting. To me, this movie is a lot like Kick Ass, another terrible movie, and adding a ""boy meets girl"" over tone. It is possibly due to the fact that they can't think of any new, decent stories for a love, so adding a superhero theme was the only way to bring new life.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A ten might seem high but this movie will always have a place in my life.,"Edgar Wright is one of my favourite directors of all time and this movie just gives you every reason why.
Perfectly adapting the graphic novel series this movie introduced me to whilst also adding original plot-lines and arcs. The acting talent of the whole cast just makes it even better, Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim (Age 22, Rating: Awesome) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers are perfect for the whole run time, not even mentioning Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells (He's gay).

Scott Pilgrim vs the World is remarkably entertaining with its extravagant Video Game/Anime-Inspired visuals, a befitting score, and music numbers that rock (literally), and on top of all that, we get to witness (once again) Wright's inherent expertise in pulling off buttery-smooth transitions and framings.When it comes down to writing a Screenplay that will keep the audience mesmerized while being over the top and peculiar, all at the same time; there is nobody like Edgar Wright. He is truly exceptional, one of a kind!

Pumping teen-angst fantasy fun,"Based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel series 'Scott Pilgrim', Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a surprisingly great teen-angst fantasy as you get to watch an almost live action computer game take place before your eyes. Geek, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) must defeat his new girlfriend's (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of Die Hard 4.0) seven evil exes in order to win her heart.Packed with famous faces, game references, kung-fu action, Street Fighter-like stand offs and a pumping soundtrack, Brit' director Edgar Wright pushes the visual envelope while keeping it mostly reality based with everyday locations.It's heroic enjoyment that is difficult to categorise, a hybrid of mix of Super Mario Bros.(1993), DOA: Dead or Alive coupled (2006), Mortal Kombat (1995) with The Matrix's (1999) fight scene excitement and American Pie's (1999), Road Trip (2000) humour. This with the teenage coming of age theme, first love etc running through it. It's also reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) and Disturbia (2007).Pilgrim is developed popcorn fun that gamers and teenagers will eat up, but it's also witty and slick enough to be enjoyed by all.Michael Bacall's screenplay & director/ writer Wright's latest offering will become a re-watchable, quoted guilty pleasure for many.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ready Player One,"Inspired by a Brian Lee O'Malley comic this film is a nerdy, yet super hip film, that is visually stylish and entertaining. It was released in 2010 and directed by Edgar Wright who has also made fun films like ""Baby Driver"", as well as the Cornetto trilogy - (""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", and ""World's End""). The plot unfolds in a version of Toronto that makes it seem like 'the' place to be. It stars Michael Cera as the titular hero Scott Pilgrim. After falling head over heels in love with Ramona Flowers, played by Mary Elizabeth-Winstead, despite already having a girlfriend, Scott must do battle with Ramona's 7 evil ex partners to prove that he is worthy of her. In true video game style, The battles get harder and harder and will all culminate with a final boss battle that could be Scott's downfall.The journey of this love story plays out like an 80s or 90s video game and pays homage to them throughout. Whether it's explaining the story of PacMan, the coin drops and their sounds, the music from Legends of Zelda, or the unique fight sequences - there is a nod to video games around nearly every corner. The film quickly becomes a visual delight and one that is unique too. In addition though, the fun soundtrack and musical score (and Scott's band ""Sex Bob-Omb"") make the sounds as well as the sights of this film a really fun experience.The acting ensemble brought together here is like a who's who of current and future films around and post 2010. With the Marvel and DC film craze only a few years away it's fun to see future superheroes in attendance here, such as Superman, The Human Torch, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Huntress, The Punisher (OK, some of them aren't necessarily super super, and yes, two of those supers are technically the same person too but I'm still counting them!). Aside from the future cape wearers, there are plenty of other big names on display in this film, some of them who hadn't reached the heights that their careers would earn them yet, and some are already established in their art; Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Alison Pill, Kieran Culkin, Jason Schwatzman... plenty to admire about the cast. Without a doubt though it's Cera and Winstead who lead the film though, their performances are dynamic and engaging. They both display a range of emotions which should hit home with the core audience that the film received in 2010.One downside to the film is that it's of its time, which means that this review must comment about how it feels slightly dated. It's only 10 years since the film was released but there are already certain things that seem a little out of place - but some might see that as kitch so let's not get too worked up about it. I just wonder though, that given another ten years, will this have dated worse still. Maybe not, maybe it will be seen as a classic and soon enough there will be a cool/hip remake of it with some people saying ""how dare they remake it"".The general summary of this film is that it's a bit of fun, it looks great and sounds good. It's well worth a watch if you have some spare time on your hands. It's not too complex that you need to analyze the plot too much, and you are likely to have a chuckle along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Great style,"This is a pretty fun and quirky movie with a unique and creative visual style. The side characters are great, the cast is good and it has some very funny moments and good action.This is a fun ride and not plot heavy but it has some major problems that take away from the movie. The movie is about Scott growing up and becoming more responsible but he spends most of the movie being such a selfish man-child that I couldn't like him even after he sees some consequences and makes some apologies. Being played by Michael Cera doesn't help his case. The plot is very geek male fantasy with Scott chasing after the manic pixie dream girl and punching a bunch of people in the process. The main conflict is he has to fight Ramona's exes, which is a very chauvinistic concept, and to make matters worst, Ramona is completely passive throughout and underdeveloped as a character. She doesn't participate in the battles with her exes (minus the one that Scott finishes at the end) and even her relationship with Scott is underdeveloped and very passive like she's just dates him because he's there and keeps asking (whish tbf was maybe intended). She's less fleshed out than most of the side character and this might be partially due to the actress. The other love interest Knives, gets more character growth and gets to fight the big bad at least. All three main characters all get their arc, but Romana's seems to happen mostly off screen and Scott's and Knives happens at the end. I think the film should've spend a little more time on the characters, specifically Ramona, and maybe less time on the fights (7 evil exes are too many, even though they were all fun). However, Edgar Wright distracted me with the great visuals and humor so much that I didn't mind the shallow love interest as much as I would've otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Ingenious, clever, touching. Edgar Wright was at the peak of his powers.","Edgar Wright's magnum opus. An exceptionally ingenious, yet surprisingly heartfelt film about the struggles of relationships and themes of commitment, change and self-belief. The film delves into an troubled young adult's psyche and puts him in a bizzare world of magic-realism, which fosters Wright's typical blend of visual comedy. It is an exhilarating and awe-inspiring watch that showcases Edgar Wright creativity, humor and deft direction, whose endless improvisations and defiance of conventional filmmaking points to him being the INFP soul that his protagonist is.The film opts for the usual light-hearted and fast paced approach to tell its story. It is impeccably scripted with great comedic touch, filled with cleverly layered callbacks and foreshadowing. The pop culture references are genuinely hilarious, especially the part concerning veganism. The film also subtly covers broader social themes such as racial inclusion. Despite of its unique flare, it never throws itself off the track in all the dazzling visual spectacle and frivolity, delivering on a solid emotional core that is relatable and meaningful.Scott Pilgrim is a clever and detailed film with the usual blend of visual comedy that Edgar Wright is known for.

"Misses the mark slightly, but still good...","I really got a kick out of the audio/visual style and the method of story telling.

The two main female leads however were good in my opinion and perhaps the point could be made the film was more about them anyway.I think the film's biggest flaw was that all the characters were presented in a one-dimensional fashion, on purpose. It would have worked better to have them all act 100% normal most of the time but then change into the one-dimensional characters during the battles. As shown, NOBODY in the film really acts like a ""normal"" person, but is stripped-down, reduced to their single purpose.

"An energetic, inventive and visual comedy that delights on every viewing.","While not quite as good as the already classic 'Cornetto trilogy', this perfectly and distinctly directed comic-book adaptation uses its energetically unconventional editing, fantastically unique framing and wonderfully written, often terrifically tangential screenplay as pure extensions of the narrative instead of just tools with which to tell it, representing the perfect combination of behind-the-lens talent and pre-existing source material. This extends to the point where the endings of both were written independently and differ greatly but still adhere directly to the style and tone of their respective pieces, strangely both feeling wholly canonical and appropriate. 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World (2010)' is funny in a very low-key kind of way and the jokes come so fast, subtly and visually that it is often hard to keep up with them, but every frame is packed with something to appreciate and that makes this a joy to re-watch (as is usually the case with Wright) and a blast every time you do. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

10th Anniversary!,"""I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own.""Snarky rocker and video game fanatic Scott Pilgrim is just days into a relationship with 17-year-old Knives when he is smitten with a new girl, Ramona. Besides ""juggling two chicks"" Scott discovers that Ramona has seven evil exes who still jealously pursue and fight for her. In blind pursuit of Ramona, Scott dives into rabbit holes that blur fantasy with reality. ""I think I needed this,"" says Scott ""whatever it is."" This new awareness, or perhaps deeper cluelessness, is all well and good, but to survive what is coming he needs to step up his game.One my favorite things about this film is the focus on relationships; discovering new love or new menace, mending wounds or moving on, and more. The knives of emotion cut in different and unexpected directions. This is especially the case for young and free city dwellers, the characters of this film, who are not so limited as previous generations were in the type of people they choose to woo. There are many intriguing and thoughtful relationship quips such as ""you should not have to rip yourself into pieces to keep others whole.""This fun, independent and super snarky comic book tale takes place on the cold streets of Toronto, which is fascinating for me because I love this city. Fast-talking and sharp-tongued young adults dominate the screen with quirky characters played by Michael Cera (Scott), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ramona), and rising stars Anna Kendrick and Brie Larson. At first glance wimpy looking Cera does not look right for the part, but one would be wrong, for Cera's dead-pan delivery, inner spark and caustic wit pair well with the character.

"Original with cool visuals, but a below-average film overall","Scott Pilgrim is a highly original film, no one can deny that, but it's just that. It don't has a good story or whats ever. It looks like a homage to the nerd and emo world, with constant references to video games and symbolism used in the modern pop rock culture. Of course, it's not boring, and the visuals are very interesting. You can see some inspirations of the film 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind' in it, such as the ice ground location and the fact that Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is impulsive and always change his hair, much alike Kate Winslet's character in the aforementioned film.But unfortunately, the story is way too dull for my taste. Almost dull just for the sake of being dull.Is just...dull. Some funny moments, or at least supposed to be funny, don't works in it. The acting was also terrible and dull. I couldn't stand the underacting of most actors. Too bad. In a quick and short resume, Scott Pilgrim is original, it's a disappointing style over content kind of film. 6.3/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Very entertaining,Very cool and entertaining to watch. This is something different and i respect it. The comic book style is really well done and the movie was great overall.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
So predictable all along but very entertaining,"The story is nothing special, just another story that revolves around romantic relationships. But what makes it interesting is that it caters to the appetite of the majority of the population of the movie goers, the youngsters. The movie tells story in a very hyperbolic way with all those comic styled written sound effects and all those game style detail notifications. But what make it even more hyperbolic are those battles with the exes. It's a great homage to Kill Bill movies in my eyes, as well as a great tribute to the more geeky youngsters who are in the band scene and the other youngsters who are gamers. The finale gives a very nice twist in line with the all too common gaming culture of save points and redo lives. The acting is just standard overall fr me. No one in this movie offers anything special with their acting parts, even having Chris Evans doesn't really help at the acting. But the whole movie feels very much entertaining, and that should be enough to cover for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
WHAT WAS THAT! AMAZING,A unique comic styled movie and for 2010 movie it is quite relatable as well as fun! A must watch if you looking for something out of the box with all in one box!,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Scott vs. Captain America, Superman and Katara","As a comedy, this movie works great. It has so many hilarious jokes edited to perfection with Edgar Wright's signature style. He knows exactly when to cut to a new shot for quick pacing, or when to hold longer on a shot to have someone tie their shoes. The movie is one of a kind in its presentation, wearing its video game inspirations proudly for all to see. As a classic gamer, I love their use of Mario, Zelda and occasional Sonic sound effects. I also love the fact that, as strange as the world gets, no one really comments on how crazy it is. They just kind of take the fact that someone bursts into coins as a fact of life.Where the movie needs to level up is as a romance. And with that being the main inciting incident and conflict of the story, it is hard to be invested in Scott's plight. I am one of the people that would have preferred the original ending of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Great fights, but...","...like a lot of Hollywood movies these days, SCOTT PILGRIM feels very insubstantial. So much money has been put on-screen to make it look good, with special effects popping out at you all the while and all manner of technical wizardry, that real, grounded storytelling and 'meat' has been left by the wayside. I appreciate the constant homages to geek culture and video games, but at the end of this film I was left feeling curiously unsatisfied.The fight scenes, which pop up with an almost routine regularity, are spectacular. The choreography is often brilliant and the addition of the special effects is the icing on the cake. The film is colourful, fast-paced and quick witted with it. But what is there beyond the visual spectacle? The humour isn't all that. Michael Cera, who I've never seen before, is intensely irritating with that whiny, lispy little voice. It is possible to make geeky leading men likable (it happened with KICK-ASS) but Cera remains an irritant from beginning to end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is much better as the object of his affection, but if you're expecting romance you'll be disappointed; such moments are non-existent.This is a flashy but ultimately unrewarding movie, something that jettisons proper plotting and character work in favour of a self-knowing, video game-style atmosphere throughout.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You can't hate this film.........,"Such a fun film. Very offbeat and very memorable. Scott Pilgrim Vs The World manages to capture the feel of comedy, and offbeat feels to a dime. Edgar Wright proved that these films can be great, and knocked everything out of the park. The actors all did great and each gave a feel for there characters as quirky and weird but funny. And also the way its filmed, the video game feel was great. It gave the right feel. Overall this is a fun, quirky, funny film that is highly rewatchable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. Seven Exes,"Edgar Wright comes back with a bang with his first American movie which is none other than 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'. Wright has proved his love for comic books and movies in his earlier excellent works like 'Spaced', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. I haven't read the original Scoot Pilgrim comic series (I've been meaning to) but as a stand alone it works fantastically.Stylish, colourful, energetic, classy and loaded with fun and action, there's hardly anything like 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'. The story is quite silly and even absurd at times but there is plenty to like and it's funny as hell. It has a very comic book/ manga feel to it and even though similar style has been witnessed in other films, Wright gives his own unique touch.I was also surprised to see how he managed to assemble so many popular young actors like Michael Cera, Jason Schwartmann, Allison Pill, Johnny Simmons, Brie Larson, Anna Kendrick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh... and the list continues. The acting overall is very good. Michael Cera's Pilgrim has shades of characters he's played earlier but I can't picture anyone else do more right by the part. Ellen Wong and Mary Elizabeth Winstead fit their parts brilliantly.Fans of Edgar Wright shouldn't expect this to be anything like his previous films because it's not. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is one of the most refreshing films to come out this year and it can be enjoyed by anyone with an open mind.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A fun watch,"Wow, the create approach for this movie definitely speaks.This movie went all out with the world feeling like a video game. You can just feel how passionate the people storyboarding this movie, we're. The dramatic shots, and character placement? I mean wow.The pace of the movie was great, the humour was relatable and realistic that is not forced onto the audience.The soundtrack was probably my favourite part. I certainly enjoyed alot of the main themes, however the instrumental parts just hit the spot. It did a great way of expressing the emotional state the characters feel.My only problem was I personally started to get a bit bored right at the end, but overall I really enjoyed this movie.I recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Surprisingly exhilarating,"When I decided to watch this movie, I was planning on stopping after 10 minutes, but immediately got glued after the engaging graphics ensued. Although some may think of the graphics as extra, they were comical, well executed, and not distracting. The cinematography was also superb and really exemplified an excitement that Wright seems to bring out in all of his works. Cera's classic innocent character works perfectly with Winstead's scandalous behavior and both manage to keep the movie's realness while in their one-on-one scenes. The Scott vs. 7 exes scenes could have been different variations of any marvel fight, but Wright makes each encounter unique with very unconventional qualities. Overall, the acting was strong, cinematography outstanding, and directing amazing, but the script was not perfect. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue seemed like it was taken out of the movie script I wrote in 5th grade, but was ultimately overpowered by the consistently strong relationship themes. Yes, I certainly recommend this movie, especially for young adults and teens!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Both new and retro,"As someone who had never read the comics, I'm really happy to say that Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is still a really good film. Right off the bat the obvious visual style of a mix of retro games with real life is super well done. The characters are funny and are great conflicting personalities with Scott. Scott's struggle and awkwardness is quirky and fun. The film is perfectly paced thanks to the total plot of the multiple ex's evenly spacing out big action scenes. The sound effects, music, and visualizations of said music is perfect and overall the plot is just really concise and interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World - 4.5 Stars,"The world that Scott Pilgrim dwells in seems like a paradise for all who cherish the activities and cultures of the teenage life. Here is a world centered on teenage relationships, video games, comic books, and rock n' roll. It allows a freedom that the youth could celebrate on a daily basis. The influence and sightings of adults in this movie are almost, if not entirely, absent.Not only are the young characters here privileged with such an exciting reality, but they are also presented with powers of many possibilities. I am thinking of a scene that could be used as an example. Oh, yeah. After an evil ex-boyfriend has been stripped of his supremacy by the vegan police, our hero head butts him, and the weakened villain explodes, leaving a pile of coins just waiting to be the fed to greedy slot machines. In a world where sudden death turns into instant riches, one would suspect that murders would be much more rampant, but not here. Given the limitless possibilities, the characters actually behave quite well.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/scott-pilgrim-world-2/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Don't waste your time or money like I just did.,I have never walked out of a movie until this one. I can't believe I just wasted $12.50 on this awful garbage. Anyone who found a point to this movie needs some help! I can't believe we sat there for a whole hour before we left and had to stop each other from killing ourselves with how boring stupid and pointless this movie was. Look out Napolean Dynamite you have competition for the worst movie ever made! I would rather watch a blank screen on my TV for several hours before watching this movie again. I would rather watch dancing with the stars. I would rather watch little house on the prairie. I would rather watch old people sex and when I say old I mean really really old grandma and grandpa old people sex before I would ever watch anything this horrible again.,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What Have I Been Missing?,"For some reason I was never drawn to this one. Every time I saw a trailer or snippets here and there I was not interested and thought it to be just not my style, similar to how I felt about 'Spy Kids' growing up. Finally, I decided to watch this over ten years later; my initial impression could not have been more inaccurate.Also, I happened to overlook that Edgar Wright is the director. 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Baby Driver' are two of my favourite movies, and I'm very much looking forward to 'Last Night in Soho'. His vision is something to behold. In many ways it's so crazy and out there, but at the same time so unique and majestically crafted that it's very entertaining to watch. The hilariously clever dialogue is something to marvel as well. And I was hooked after the initial 'Zelda: A Link to the Past' sound effects.Michael Cera was great in 'Arrested Development', but this has to be his best outing, especially since he's the lead. An all star support cast too.Last note, since I'm Canadian (not at all from Toronto) I thoroughly got a kick out of the Canadian references. Specifically, when the coins fall on the ground in the one scene near the end you can see the loonies and twonies!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I love it! This's Edgar Wright!,"To date with the girl who Scott Pilgrim likes, he has to beat seven ex-boyfriends of her!
It had the funny development. For example, the psychic battle was happened suddenly and the alphabets of the sound came from the guitar. It was similar to comics! Also, the cool effects like the animes were used a lot in the images!I thought the battle scene looked like the fighting games or rather the movie. I laughed the most in the Bollywood dance scene. But I prefer the live scenes than the battles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"""Scott Pilgrim"" is truly an epic, original, and unique movie experience, in other words, it's a MUST SEE!","I have been seeing the trailers, television spots, and internet advertisements for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" for several months now and I have to admit they have gotten me super excited for the film. I kind of worried, however, if this film would gain an audience. Sure the concept looked original and unique but Michael Cera, who I particularly like, doesn't seem to have the star power yet to headline a big budget film. This didn't matter to me because I knew I would see the flick right away regardless of how it did. So this past weekend, I grabbed the girlfriend and we ventured into the local theater to see just how epic ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" would truly be.""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" tells the story of Scott Pilgrim played perfectly by Michael Cera. Scott plays in a rock band and has a high school girlfriend named Knives (Ellen Wong) because he still hasn't gotten over a woman from his past who broke his heart. One day, Scott Pilgrim sees a beautiful woman at a library and lets just say its love at first sight. A few days later, Scott runs into this mystery woman again at a party and learns that her name is Ramona Flowers (the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and she is from New York. Scott is now determined to win Ramona's heart, which is easier said than done. He soon finds out that the only way to truly win Ramona is to defeat her seven evil exes. A lot of epic awesomeness ensues...While I have seen some pretty great flicks this year, ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Inception"" probably being the best, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" hits theaters and pretty much finishes out my top three films of the 2010 list. That's right I am actually going to say that ""Scott Pilgrim"" was one of the best films of the year. Why you may ask? Well there are several reasons. The first reason is because it's a fun filled ride. This movie hands down is the most fun I had at a movie in years. The next reason is the way it's shot and the overall look and feel of the film. Like ""Avatar"" it truly was a unique movie experience. The third reason would have to be the fact that the film itself is wildly original and featured a unique story about a clichéd topic. The idea of a guy having to defeat his girlfriend's seven evil exes is original enough but the way Edgar Wright filmed it only makes it more unique and enjoyable.With that being said, I guess I should talk about Edgar Wright, who to me is a fine director. Sure he isn't that big in the United States with movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" being cult classics in the states but he really does know how to direct a good film. I always enjoy how he brings the script to life and in this case, I really like how he brought the comic of ""Scott Pilgrim"" to life. No I never read the comics themselves but heard from fan boys that he literally did a near perfect adaptation of the book to film. I really like the way he shot the film, the weird screen angles, the action sequences, and just about everything was truly unique. It's like the new ""Sin City""/ ""Matrix"" from a visual perspective.Acting was solid all round. The chemistry between Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Michael Cera was perfect. They both played well with the sweet and touching love story. It felt like a match made in heaven. The supporting performances by Rory Culkin and all of Ramona's evil exes are all note worthy especially Jason Schwartzman, who I always love seeing on the big screen. I really am amazed he isn't a bigger actor at this point. The casting was pretty much dead on with all the characters really playing off one another.In the end, I really don't have anything negative to say about ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and that's odd for someone who is usually pretty harsh on films. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is a movie that dares to be different. It's a fun filled ride that never becomes too silly or too serious. It's a truly unique movie-going experience not only because of the way it's shot but because it mixes a whole bunch of genres together including comedy, drama, action, video games, and music. The script is fresh and original. It features some great one liners as well that will be quoted by several fan boys and fan girls in the months ahead. Great one liners that include, ""I am lesbians for you,"" ""Let's both be girls,"" and ""I'm just a little bi-furious!"" Don't know what I am talking about, well than you haven't seen the epic awesomeness that is ""Scott Pilgrim"" and I highly recommend you venture out to your local theater to see it. Its definitely one of the best films of the entire year!MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" is a solid 9 out of 10. It's a fun filled movie-going experience unlike any other you have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Visually amazing, the perfect graphic novel film .","Films such as Watchmen, Kick Ass, Sin City and Iron Man. These are films that are based on graphic novels and how their big screen adaption made a change to the novel itself, well sometimes.With Scott Pilgram movie and its part of the graphic novel, which is about a 23-year old hero who plays bass with his band 'Sex Bob-Omb'. He then falls in love with a roller blading delivery girl Ramona V. Flowers. He then realizes he as to defeat her seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to claim her heart.It's previews may make you think its not enough to keep you interested, you might want to think about changing your mind whatever way. It's special-effects are dazzling and sharp, its whole setting as a fast forward video-game also references video games we all know obviously.The cast is pretty well done and furiously good. With help from Michael Cera, Chris Evans, Mary Winstead, Ellen Wong, Brandon Routh and Jason Schwartzman. And with its overloaded characters on the list, it's also fun to just look and learn about them.Overall, i recommend this film to anyone who wants to have crazy and furious time at the movies, totally worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
25 years of my video game obsession rolled into one movie,"I have never left a movie wanting to round up my friends and immediately going back to see a movie a 2nd time right away, but Scott Pilgrim did just that to me.Problem being since I am a video game nerd I don't really have any friends.Never the less I will tell you why you must see Scott Pilgrim Vs The World. The movie on a purely visual stance is breath taking, the over the top fight scenes are done extremely well and all the little words and status bars throughout are cleverly placed. You do not need to be a nerd of epic proportions to enjoy this movie. You do however have to enjoy silly humor and suspend your disbelief.There is nothing realistic about this movie, characters are knocked through four walls before being punched in the face. Through hundreds of feet and have wall speaker dragons coming at them. It is a goofy movie at its core but its so much fun and the performances all around are so well done that you will not care how silly its truly being.Enjoy this wild ride, see it in theaters now! And buy the Blu-ray whenever it comes out! There is no reason this movie should be earning less than Step Up 3D!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Wonderful Deviation into a Video game-like World,"By far my favourite movie ever. This particular movie did not get the best reviews by movie critics, but recently I have found that a good 50% of movies that critics rave about tend to be just awful while movies they claim are terrible are actually good.Who should and should not see this movie? This movie is NOT for people who: do not like videogames, do not like dry or slap-stick humor, hate slightly sexual scenes, only find bathroom humor funny, and/or people who hate anything even slightly romantic.This movie IS for: anyone who has ever played videogames and liked them, anyone who likes funny/silly movies, anyone who likes fight scenes, and anyone who enjoys a little romance in their movies.The movie is filled with video game references. If you are a video game nerd (like me), you will love it. Zelda music is used quite a bit, as well as many other well-known music in the gaming world like Mario and Final Fantasy. A lot of video game themes are also used, for instance there is a part in the movie where one of the characters says to Scott, ""Where are you going?"" and Scott, after looking up to see a 2D cartoon-version of his face revolving in the air next to him, snatches it (the cartoon face disappears to be replaced by word ""1-UP"") and responds, ""To get a life."" Things like this are all throughout the movie and you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying their incorporation. This movie is also full of fight scenes, which are done in a very Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat fashion.Everything about this movie was done extremely well. I can find no fault with it. It is just a wonderful movie. If you haven't seen it and you fit under the ""This movie IS for"" description above, go see it. You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Overrated reviews and 15 years too late,"I went to the video club to get a movie I hoped would not disappoint. I usually check reviews on IMDb on my iPhone if I do not know to much about a movie. So I did about Scott Pilgrim. When I saw an average of 8 stars I immediately grabbed the Bluray thinking it would be great. Unfortunately, as I sat through the show I kept wondering how Pilgrim got such high marks; it's an OK flick but nothing to get excited. I suspect the producers paid people to write positive reviews on IMDb and other boards to improve DVD sales.This film would have been innovative if done 10 or 15 years ago, but today it's bit too late. For the Scott Pilgrim comics books aficionados maybe this is a great movie but for the rest of us it does not impress much.The story is a bit flat; it's about a guy who must kill the exes of the girl he is dating. The killing happens in a video game fantasy world that is set in reality. That's it! Video game arcade world is so passé! The movie takes a bit from several films of the genre like The Matrix, Hero, etc, it' a melting pot of ideas that other movies rendered with much better results and inspiration. There is nothing profound to be discovered here and apart from the few funny moments, it's insufficient reason to justify renting that movie.'Kick-Ass', similar in style and genre, is a much better and funnier movie than Pilgrim, a pale imitation of the genre.For this one, one can wait for it to play on TV.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Amazing in every way.,"I saw this on Friday with my friend, and we were stunned at how great this movie was. Both of us read books 1 and 2, and this movie was AMAZINGLY faithful. Everything was fantastic. Acting, cast, and especially effects. Everyone in the cast played their roles perfectly. I can't think of anyone better to play any of the characters. They were perfect. The effects were amazing. So well done. It feels like a video game movie, which was fantastic, and I loved it. For those who haven't read the books, the movie is exactly like the books. Goofy, and ridiculous. And I loved all the video game references. I also loved the Thomas Jane and Clifton Collins Jr. cameo. It was hilarious.

Great action/comedy with a love story thrown in.  All for the Nintendo generation.,"I, for one, was not impressed with the trailer for this movie. I had never heard of the graphic novel at the time. Basically, I never planned to go see it at the theater. I don't know if it was the lack of marketing or maybe bad timing.I will never base another movie off of just the trailer alone. This is an amazing movie and I feel like I missed out on an amazing experience by not seeing it in a theater. Edgar Wright(Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) does an amazing job while completely changing gears from his normal style of directing.At the beginning, the story itself isn't that unique. Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) has a girlfriend and he's in a band. He's kind of a jerk. He finds a new girl that he likes better. It's when he goes out with this new girl, Ramona(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), that things start getting interesting.I'll admit, it starts off fairly slow at the beginning. That changes all too quickly as the usual stumbling, bumbling Michael Cera(Superbad, Juno) turns into a martial arts expert that has to fight off Ramona's seven evil exes. The visuals are extreme, as well as the soundtrack which revolves around a lot of the band's songs. Anyone from the Nintendo generation will get a kick out of these, as there are multiple times when various scenes will include an homage to classics such as Mario.These fights are all done in a unique manner and surprisingly well choreographed. Each of the evil exes are type-casted perfectly, in my opinion. From Chris Evans(Fantastic Four, Captain America) playing the over-the-top bad boy, to Brandon Routh(Superman Returns) and Jason Schwartzman playing their roles perfectly. Great supporting roles done by Anna Kendrick(Twilight) and Kieran Culkin(who is hilarious in this). Ellen Wong makes her major motion-picture debut and impresses.If you are a member of the Nintendo generation(or just a fan of video games in general), or if you like music, or if you like comics, or are a fan of pop culture, or if you want to just have a really fun movie experience done superbly by the director, Edgar Wright, then you need to check out this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the Classics.,"Scott Pilgrim has to be one of the top 10 most entertaining movies ever made. It is fast paced, full of humor, and has the most insane action sequences in a comedy. Anyone who likes video games will love this little under-rated masterpiece.It is clear that this movie was inspired by comic hitting sounds like ""Kapow"" and ""Thwack"", but actually shown in the movie like the original Batman TV series when it showed those kinds of words; also the biggest inspiration was Nintendo 8-bit games. This was inspired by video games but not based on video games, so it's safe from a train wreck of a video game movie like Alone in the Dark.Michael Cera actually acts in this movie and makes his role seem like the same character he always plays, but a thousand times better. Cera plays Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Ramona. However before he can be Ramona's proper boyfriend he has to defeat Ramona's seven evil exes. A linear sounding plot but grade A+ ++ entertainment as a result.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most entertaining feel good movie since Back to the Future. No one should miss out on this now cult classic as it has romance (good and not boring romance), great and funny characters, great action, great dialogue, great comedy and most of all, an unforgettable experience.

"Video games, Fire Balls, Action; Mama Mia!","Scott Pilgrim is a 20-something small-time Canadian bass-guitarist living with a gay friend. He is dating a seventeen year old Asian girl, Knives C, much to the chagrin of those around him. Scott is smitten by Ramona Flowers, a mysterious girl with occasional tendencies of appearing in his dreams. But in order to get her, he has to battle and defeat the seven people she last dated or as they prefer calling them - her seven evil exes.The story is not very intricate or clever. A boy loves a girl and must do something extraordinarily difficult (you know, fight someone dangerous people, climb Everest on his hands, listen to non-stop Justin Bieber for forty seven days) to win her over. But the way it has been portrayed is rather brilliant. It has been told in a nonchalant manner you can almost hear it saying 'who cares?' In a world where every movie is trying to outdo the other in terms of complicated plot lines and overwhelming stories, SPVTW comes like a burst of breath air. It doesn't make you think very much. The director Edgar Wright keeps things simple. However, unlike most other no-brainers, it gets the concoction right. Nothing has been overdone and the film falls strictly under the walls of sanity. The detached light-heartedness, the comic-timing, the ease with which the story flows all makes it delightful. It is the kind of film that you can watch multiple times yet not get tired of.All the characters in the film are well-rounded and the actors play their parts with ease. The upcoming Michael Cera does an endearing job of being a cross between a bass guitarist with a penchant for pink- haired girls and a video-game uber-nerd. He makes a good lost-in-the- dark kid as creepy men repeatedly try and mash him to pulp. Scott isn't your stereotypical 'oh-he-is-so-nice' hero. Chicks won't swoon over him. They simply won't see how fighting seven incredibly powerful lunatics (most with superpowers) is being a better boyfriend than stalking, ditching and vampirizing your girlfriend. Alas, he can't glow in the sunlight; maybe that's the reason.Though the film has plenty of side characters to toy around with, it manages to get them all right. The exes, Ramona, Knives, Scott's gay roommate Wallace, among a plethora of others, are all distinctly characterized. You don't get confused between any of them, remembering each of them by their individual personalities and idiosyncrasies. They carve their own identities within whatever little screen-time they are given. Many great movies have fallen in this trap, but Scott Pilgrim doesn't, making it all the more commendable.The movie has a noticeable retro-gaming touch to it. It shows that the little things matter most and define the quality of the film. There are pee-bars, bass solos, anti-gravity stunts, bold subtitles, a Vegan, one- ups, KOs and plenty of other things that remind you of antiquated games. Defeated villains explode to coins. The action is very Matrix-like. Each villain enters like fighters in Street Fighter, or Mortal Kombat if you prefer. The action sequences are fast-paced with lots of fancy animation, effects and impact-verbs like 'whack!' or 'slam!' There is tons of eye-candy which also makes it a visual treat. Since it has been adopted from a comic, they are like a tribute to the original, glossy paper-back version.Unfortunately, not much of the audience enjoyed it at first go. It proved to be a sleeper, blazing onto #1 on Blu-ray after its unceremonious exit from the theatres. The reasons were plenty and obvious. The sense of humour is impeccable. The jokes are funny, dark, caustic, satirical; yet always funny. The romance isn't mawkish and is one of the best I have seen in a while. It is refreshing. It doesn't make pretensions or allusions to something it could have been. Everything is right in front of you. Video-games, comics and cartoons truly make a spectacular movie.It also teaches a very valuable lesson. Before you decide to date a girl, know if she has any ex-boyfriends with superpowers you might want to be careful off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Refreshing FUN Movie!,"I am not a fan of Michael Cera. I've never liked him after seeing Juno or Superbad. I felt his comedic timing and delivery was off. However, Cera has redeemed himself in my eyes with this movie.Scott Pilgrim (Cera), is dating a 17-year old named Knives (Ellen Wong) when he has a dream about Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). After meeting her, he asks her out. Shortly afterward, Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) shows up and claims that in order to continue dating Ramona, Scott has to defeat him and the other six ""evil exes"".Right from the opening Universal studio logo shot this movie is just wicked fun. It's hilarious right from the start, it's like watching someone play a video game, and not to mention, the action is pro-kid! Bring an two-year old to this because when people are killed or damaged, they don't bleed, they burst into coins. It's romantic at times and the story is quite simple to follow.I simply loved the way that the text appeared on screen at certain times. I enjoyed all the comedy and it's nothing brilliant or deep about it which makes it all the more intelligent. The fact that Edgar wasn't trying to be a big blockbuster hit makes this movie that much greater! I find this movie to be a sleeper hit. It might not make as much as Inception or The Expendables, but in my eyes, this is a summer blockbuster.I think another great addition to Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is that the f-word is bleeped out and they work that fact into the storyline and make it even funnier. Michael Cera's delivery is spot-on and I love the look of Mary Winstead as Ramona. I remember Winstead from Final Destination 3, but she's never looked as hot as she does here, especially with the pink hair.Even parents who go with their kids to this film will have a good time. It's a fun movie, and shouldn't be viewed as anything else. I don't care about the physic errors or anything because that's not what the story is about. It's a fantasy movie mixed with comic book aspects and it plays out like a video game. It's great fun for everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
This film about emotional baggage has brilliant simplicity in its hi-octane mix,"Every so often you come across a film with so many layers of complexity on what appears to be a simple subject you either become engaged in the drama of it all or have a headache by the end. The therapy of reversing this in Scott Pilrim Vs The World is so cathartic, refreshing and entertaining who could be left with a headache? Certainly not the cast and crew of this wonderfully original take on love in all its many guises. And certainly not the audience, either.We take the complex subject of emotional baggage and exorcise it in the simplest way we can, visually, with cues, cartoons, music, fantasy, and energy in abundance. Love wins out in the end, no matter how hard we try to stop it happening. And we are only victims if we decide to be victims. And what can be wrong about a story that is designed to be so very uplifting? Nothing.Please see this and enjoy it for what it is: sheer inspiration in education, entertainment and enlightenment.

Scott as a main character isn't bad, it just shows him being vulnerable to this whole adventure he's going through for the girl he likes.

Ultimate geek fantasy,"After seeing this movie I just had to read all 6 volumes of the comic this movie is based on. I must say I liked the comic a bit more since the movie didn't have some of the good parts in the comic. But that is understandable and this movie really is a very good adaptation. This movie is very unique and really got the essence of the comic and the vibe as well. I heard Edgar Wright made a lot of effort and time in making this film and Bryan Lee O'Malley even pitched in and helped with certain scenes and it was worth the effort and time. I personally think to get the most out of this movie, watch this movie first before reading the comic. Although, like I said the comic seemed to be a bit better but the movie does things in a way where some of the witty dialogue and direction that isn't in the comic gives a lot of flare to this movie. Maybe it's just the slightly different approach in certain angles and parts of the film, the humor in this is done better than the comic itself. This is probably one of the best video game style movie I have ever seen and it's not even based on a real video game although that game after the movie. Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this movie and hit the mark almost entirely. Fans of the comic this movie is based on won't be disappointed, it might even surpass most people's expectations. Sometimes pop culture references doesn't work in movies sometimes but it worked just fine in this one, especially about the way certain group of people dress, mainly hipsters. The constant things happening in the background was interesting as well, even if it was random or didn't make much sense. My favorite Ex's out of the seven Scott has to fight is the two superheroes, Superman and Captain America...Yeah it's a lame joke but those two actors was very entertaining to watch and seemed to be enjoying themselves. What is really shocking is how this movie has like seven villains in one movie but it still works really well and doesn't fall short of almost anything. I think this 2 movies might have worked better in order to get more of the stuff in the comics in movie form. Like the first movie would be called ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and the second movie to end it all be called ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the Universe"".

So Odd but so Right,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was such a silly and quirky movie that it worked. This was one of those movies that would not make any sense to most people you explained it to. If you tried explaining it and why you like it then you'd look stranger and stranger the more you explained.I found myself either laughing-out-loud or smiling approvingly the entire movie. I enjoyed just about all of the movie from the relationship quandaries of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) to the animated fight scenes. It was all so odd but yet so right.Michael Cera is so plain and deadpan that it makes his character (a heartbreaking serial romancer on the rebound that plays bass in a band) all the funnier. This is an excellent relax-and-enjoy movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A good film wasted on a weak lead actor.,"This film has a really spectacular supporting cast and what would have been a great premise IF it had been built around a better actor. I doubt even readers of the comic imagined the weedy, sunken-chested, round-shouldered, soprano-voiced Michael Cera as Scott (except possibly in their nightmares).Honestly, what was Edgar Wright thinking? Cera is the vacuous center around which this film careens and I don't think that was the intention. He's eclipsed by Kieran Culkin (who obviously intends to be Robert Downey Jr.'s successor in acerbically droll performances), Anna Kendrick and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who looks as if she could crush Cera). A shame, because with a strong lead this could have been a great film, one which actually made money.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Not bad, but barely qualifies as mediocre.","Scott Pilgrim vs the world is such a boring film. This is from the guy who directed Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead? *shakes head*. If you've seen the trailer you don't need me to explain the premise, but suffice to say Michael Cera is a terrible actor. He's not funny in this movie, he looks like he doesn't care about anything that's going on, and we have no reason to care about him or his plight.The movie is pretty much 100% eye candy. There's a good use of sound, and despite the fact I grew up during the height of the 8-bit gaming era, I felt a strong disconnect with this film. I mean what reason do we have to be interested in this film? The Evil Ex's are kind of interesting but their screen time is fairly minimal.The protagonist is a jerk, and frankly the most interesting character in this film is Scott Pilgrim's gay roommate(Portrayed by Kieran Culkin). Even as a Gamer this movie was bland and uninteresting to say the least. Seriously, the fight scenes were pretty, but when I can say the fight scenes in Matrix Reloaded look better, something is terribly wrong.Yeah, the visuals are cool, but even with those visuals this movie is still lame. It's really a marathon and really hard to sit through.

Scott Pilgrim vs. The World 2010 Review,"""When i'm around you, I kind of feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs. Unless you do drugs, in which case I do them all the time. All of them.""
Personal Ancedote:
I personally know nothing about Scott Pilgrim, the day before today I found out that this is actually based off graphic novels which was a pleasant surprise. I knew the film had some comic book flair to it, but not based off actual comics.I was originally going to go to the theatre today to see Wrath of Man, but instead I saw they had a showing for Scott Pilgrim for its 10th / 11th anniversary. I couldn't pass up seeing this beloved movie in an actual theatre.This is definitely a movie worth seeing on the big screen compared to at-home.Review:
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a delightful, visually stunning film.It's a weird comic book / anime / video game hybrid-like film that blends all those genres in such a unique and wonderful way.It's an understatement to say that this film is extremely visually appealing. From its comic book onomatopoeias to its vibrant color grading this film is pure eye candy.I don't think there's too much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said? It has some awesome characters, quotable quotes, a great fast paced story, fantastic editing, good comedy, and of course a banging soundtrack / score.""You were once a ve-gone, but now you will be-gone.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A different kind of movie for a different kind of audience.,"I loved this film but, sadly, most people will be confused by it. Anyone who understands the basics of Japanese Anime and video games will feel right at home is this stylish mishmash of Manga, Nintendo, Kung-Fu, and Indy Rock. The plot is ludicrous, Scott Pilgim (Michael Cera), an unassuming Canadian geek that meets the girl of his dreams (literally) but must first defeat her seven deadly exes in order to be with her. The battle scenes are half video game, half Kung-Fu Anime, with each ex possessing a different power or ability that Scott Pilgrim must overcome, ranging from double duplicates to bass guitar telekinesis. The effects and choreography are very well done and even the most insane aspects of the movie make a certain kind of sense once you let go of your sense of rationality and go with the flow of the film.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not for everyone but it was definitely for me, the music was cool, the directing was clever, and the story was original and entertainingly presented.

Very Good,"Just saw this on DVD. It isn't the type of movie that I want to see on the BIG screen. The big screen to me is made for big block buster special effects movies. For movies of a more personal rom-com nature that could be really good, bland or stupid I prefer a smaller price tag. I do have to say that of I saw this in the theater, I would not have been disappointed and consider my money well spent. This movie is a creative imaginative out there kind of movie and it really hit me on most cylinders. Being that it is off-beat, not all people are going to appreciate it. I found it very funny and it was done in a comic book fashion that took a minute to get with the program. The dialogue was interesting and the plot unfolded well. The actors helped the movie in that they had the ability to make believe they were serious, even if the whole movie was not serious. It is a key ingredient to movies like these.

"Unique, witty, epic and above all entertaining.","Scott Pilgrim VS the World is a rare gem that caters to the comic geeks and gamers of the world. It's an adrenaline-fueled flashy good time and the most fun I've had with any other movie of 2010.The film follows Scott Pilgrim, a jaded slacker who's still coping from his bitter break up with his ex Envy. In the middle of a rebound relationship with a young school-girl named Knives., he comes across the girl of his dreams (literally); Ramona Flowers. But as Scott soon discovers, claiming this girl as his own is easier said than done. And in order to win her heart, he must defeat her seven evil exes.The story plays out much like a video game. But where video game movies in the past have failed, this movie succeeds. Usually with video game movies, they strive on trying to be as realistic as they can. With Scott Pilgrim it is the opposite. The film welcomes the surreal, and the further it shifts from reality, the better it gets.It's quirky graphic novel style is a colourful work of art and looks absolutely stunning. Kudos to Edgar Wright on bringing this comic book style to life on the big screen.Scott Pilgrim is full of an amazing cast, fun music, and plenty of 90's references for 20-somethings to enjoy.

Movie vs. Graph Novel,"The Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series is a great mix of comedy, romance, science fiction and fantasy. I was fortunate enough to see a screening of the film at San Diego Comic Con.I am also a huge fan of Edgar Wright. His vision of the film turned an epic genre mash up into a big screen video game. It was fun to watch but a poor substitute for the books. The jokes were there and the action was EXTREMELY there. A few illustrations were even there.Wright did his best to include as much of the books into the film, instead of skipping over smaller details the way other book-films do. It was refreshing to see this but it hurt the movie. The film felt rushed and the characters lacked arc. I give Wright props for not trying to turn SP into another comic book sequel ruining genre but if the film was split in two the characters would feel real the way they did in the books.Ultimately the film is a fun summer action comedy. If you're a fan of the books you won't hate it but you won't love it. And if you're a fan of Edgar Wright you'll probably call it your least favorite Wright.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim is the BEST blend of Comedy and Action in years!,"So, before seeing the film, I was in no way a fan. I hadn't read any of the books. I'm the farthest thing from a hipster. All I knew was that Edgar Wright directed it and the trailer looked pretty neat. But, after actually watching the film.IT'S FRAKKIN AMAZING BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR FOR THE LOVE OF KNIVES CHAU!!Okay, fan girl moment over. In all seriousness, Scott Pilgrim was a brilliant film that probably won't receive all of the attention or accolades it deserves. Not in years has a film been able to nail both hilarious, sharp dialogue and meticulous action sequences dead-on. First of all, the movie was hilarious. The lines were sardonic and tongue-in- cheek, and very much aimed for our generation.Secondly, the director Edgar Wright probably went about adapting the comic/ graphic novel to film in the best way a director has ever adapted a comic to film - by having it play like a comic within the realm of live-action film. It was probably my favorite element of the film. At times, the scenes played out like panels on a page, with the zany transitions and narrative headings. Even the fight sequences - which were epic but still hilarious in their own right - maintained this video game feel, with use of the ""K.O."" and ""1-UP"" terminology. I'm not a big video game fan, but I really appreciated that approach.And, lastly, the characters supporting Scott Pilgrim were so dynamic and lovable. Two words: KNIVES CHAU. The funniest little Asian high school girl ever. ""You knocked the highlights out of her hair!!"" Kieran Culkin's Wallace was also notably hilarious and I loved Brie Larson's Envy as well.Bottom line: Inception was cool and super deep and all, but Scott Pilgrim is the most all-around entertaining film of the year. I know it's still only August, but no film has come anywhere near this one yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It actually kicks *ss,"I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before.

Some months later(obviously) it came out on DVD and I decided to watch it with my girlfriend who was also quite excited.All I can say is that we were so disappointed that after around 20-30 minutes we switched it off and watched something else.For starters I'm a nerd, I love video games and Nintendo but the constant references were just dull and repetitive. It was far too over the top. The characters were also dull and their one liners were as punchy as a pacifist. The story was linear I felt that it should have lasted literally the 20-30minutes of my viewing.The main reason I didn't like the movie was that Scott Pilgrim was a jerk. I mean how can you empathise with a character who cheats on his girlfriend? And thinks it's OK? And then carries on like nothing happened?One more thing, how can a weedy nerd with no training beat up anyone especially 'evil' people who seem fairly tough? He's a weedy loser.My advice, if you're between the ages of 12 and 17, you might (not definitely will) enjoy this movie because it has a lot of references to retro stuff that means nothing to you, 'cool' indie music and random untied extra garbage. If you're 18+ and genuinely like this movie, I literally have no idea why.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Brilliant cult, comic book movie that hits its target audience on the dot!","Seriously? Reading some of these reviews (I started from 1* upwards to see what people actually thought) it's become apparent that people have totally missed the point in this film. The world that constantly crops up to these imbeciles is 'emo'... How the hell is this film emo? Its fun, witty and action packed to the brim. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is purely because of how the ending slightly differs to the better comic book original.Cera does a great job as Scott. I had my doubts as 99% of Cera's roles are the same character... he really changed his ways for this. My hats off have to go to Winstead who plays Ramona... just fantastic. And wow, did she look good.I'm not one to waffle so I'll clear things up quickly. This is a great movie. Don't listen to the idiots who just don't get it, I expect they won't get any of the music or cult references either. These same people probably liked Kick-ass but again, not get the quirky little cult jokes (as a brit seeing Durham Red on a poster in Kick-Ass made me laugh and be proud at the same time). One review for this film said something on the lines of 'It focuses too much on video games yet never mentions Scott been into video games' ... I laughed at this.. again missing the point. He's not imagining the video game stuff.. It's that world, that creation of Bryan Lee O'Malley.If you have read the Scott Pilgrim book series, you WILL adore this film. It does it justice. If you haven't read them or never read a comic or played on video games in your life, and/or are over the age of 35 and have no imagination... then avoid it because your only putting on stupid reviews that make no sense.If you have any social and cult awareness, you will love it. Just... go see it... see it twice. Pre-order the blue-ray. Make them some well deserved money (seen as the terrible movie Expendables stole it all in the US)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Edgar Wright knocks it out of the park...,"Let me start this review by saying that I did not see this film at the cinema, it didn't draw me in, and I was foolishly unaware that it was directed by Edgar Wright at the time of cinema release.I'm a huge fan of Spaced (TV show directed by Wright) but I wasn't an enormous fan of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. I did think they were exceptionally made films, but for me they lacked something, a heart a sense of substance. The comedy was there, but it still felt like as a feature film director Edgar Wright was cutting his teeth, still working with Simon Pegg et al (no complaints, but you would always compare the work with Spaced and that would be hard to top). I always felt like Edgar Wright would do more once he left his Spaced roots behind.Then came Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, like I say I didn't know it was a Wright film, and I wasn't drawn in by the marketing of it and didn't see it until it arrived in my living room on a movie channel. But I have never been more surprised, amused, filled with joy and just ****ing entertained by a movie. It was one of those moments, like seeing Fight Club for the first time. You didn't know it was going to be that good. And after that it becomes one of the films you always consider to be exceptionally good and a milestone in cinema.I believe this film will be entertaining and a joy to any audience over 12 but perhaps Scott Pilgrim will appeal in a particular way to anyone who grew up with Nintendo games. Being in my late 20s (and a boy, although girls play Nintendo too I'm told :), I'm the perfect audience for this film. The Zelda, Mario bros, Street Fighter etc references are wonderfully placed and never feel like they're getting in the way of the plot or the characters.What this film does in a way in which I've never seen a film do before is seamlessly blend the real world, computer games and young romance, and the conflict, struggles and bliss that it brings into a cohesive and endlessly entertaining couple of hours. It's just the most brilliant fun, and I am extremely cynical about modern films.I don't use my words lightly when I say that the last film that impressed me this much and reminded me of how incredible films can be, was Fight Club. Though in tone, subject matter and style they are different beasts altogether, they really both share the same frenetic pace and sense of limitless imagination. Edgar Wright has come into his own with this film, pitching special effects, stylistic combat, humour and pace to near perfection. Usually you would sacrifice humour or depth or a sense of human emotion through the use of such fantastic and supernatural elements, but Edgar Wright pulls it off. Exceptionally cast, with Kieran Culkin stealing every scene he appears in... The music couldn't be better (Beck wrote the songs that Scott Pilgrims band plays throughout the film). The dialogue is relentlessly funny, with too many one liners to quote here. It's hard to find fault with this film, although I'm trying to. If I had read the comic books the film is based on (I haven't) I'd probably have some fan boy gripe about a missing character or a misrepresented event, but I have not.All I can say is, if you haven't seen this film, see it as soon as possible. It's one of the best films of the past ten years and I can't wait to see what Edgar does next. I never give ten out of ten because perfection in anything is impossible, but please see this 9/10 as my version of a 10 for Scott Pilgrim vs The World. It's quite simply awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Too much special effects and a poor plot don't work well together.,"Let me begin by stating that I don't know if Scott Pilgrim vs the World is either unique or weird. Probably both. Fact is, while watching it, I wasn't very entertained. See, I believe that if a movie has an interesting plot, deep and likable characters and witty dialog, it can get away with not having top-notch special effects. My main problem with Scott Pilgrim vs the World is that it fails in these three important aspects. As I watched the movie, all I got was special effects, and special effects, and more special effects. While these wouldn't have bothered me if the movie was good plot-wise, this is not the case.The story revolves around Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera), a slightly nerdy guy in his early twenties who is dating a girl in high school, Knives Chau(Ellen Wong). While everything was good at first, he starts to feel like she's too childish sometimes, and feels unhappy with his relationship. Then, he has a weird dream about a woman with purple hair, Ramona Flowers(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), whom he later meets at a party. They eventually start dating, and Scott finds out that in order to continue going out with Ramona, he must defeat her seven evil exes. Yes, seven evil exes, you read that right. Now, my main problem with the plot is how little importance they give to it, since after all of this has been explained the plot feels like an excuse to show off special effects in colorful fights. The fights itself are okay at first, but start to get repetitive after a while. It usually consists of Scott getting kicked around the area, then finding a miraculous way to save himself and win. Even with all the special effects, I eventually got bored of watching Scott go through brick walls and beating his enemies in the stupidest way possible(remember the words ""vegan police"").Another thing that bothered me were the characters. While I liked Cera in movies like Superbad and Juno, his character here wasn't very likable, and often came off as annoying. Also, I didn't believe the chemistry between Scott and Ramona until the very end of the movie, it just felt unrealistic. And, yes, even though this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie, if I don't buy the interaction between the two main characters, then how am I supposed to enjoy the fights when I don't understand what they're fighting for? There's one character, Scott's sister Stacey(Anna Kendrick), that is completely useless. If she wasn't in the film, nobody would notice, and I assume they left her in for ""comic relief"". The only REAL comedy(and props to the actor)comes with Scott's gay roommate, Wallace(Kieran Culkin), who uses dry humor to entertain.If I had to highlight the best part of Scott Pilgrim vs the World, it would be the quality of the effects. It's not like I'm changing my opinion all of a sudden, I never complained about their quality, I complained about their usage in the movie. Sin City, another movie based on a graphic novel(although much darker), managed to keep the visual flair inspired from the comics and added an excellent narrative to keep the viewer interested. Scott Pilgrim vs the World has the visual flair but has no narrative to keep us from leaving our seats.I remember the days where all you needed was a good script to make an excellent movie(Pulp Fiction! Yay!), even if I wasn't even born at that time. Scott Pilgrim vs the World suffers from the now common disease of ""many special effects equals good movie"". It's colorful yet bland. It's annoying when it should be fun. Still, Scott Pilgrim vs the World isn't an awful movie, and I'm sure there are many people out there who think it's some sort of masterpiece, but if you're like me and enjoy good narrative over special effects, then you likely won't enjoy this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Geek Heaven,"Hello everybody who likes to read excellent reviews! well done to you. From the opening credits to the end scene, this film is one of my all time favourite comedies. It is some of Edgar Wright's finest work, it is almost certainly some of Micheal Cera's finest moments, and it really is a change of style to the gross out comedies that seem to have inflicted cinema and TV screens over the past few years. I am not going to bore you with going through the plot, as nobody reads reviews for that, they read them to canvas the viewing audience's opinion. Instead i will merely say this to you.IF YOU WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, WATCH THIS.Wow that was a bit much. Anyway, if you are still reading this and haven't been scared off by the angry text i previously displayed, then let me talk you through why you should see this, or more to the point, why I saw this.I missed this whilst it was at the cinema, and wasn't to keen from the reviews i had heard from it. I expected it to be another let down like most comics that have been converted into films (apart from Sin City, love that film.) A few weeks after it had been showing on Sky, my girlfriend at the time said that we should watch this film. As we had just began to start dating, everything was fresh and exciting, and as we could barely keep our hands off each other, this film blended into the background at first. But as i moved my now ex girlfriend aside to focus fully on the film (ohhh maybe thats why i am now single?) i wish i hadn't of wasted all that time at the beginning by heavy petting (yep, definitely why i am now single!)This film is hilarious, in every way a film can be. Excellent fast pacing, with some truly great performances along the way. Micheal Cera is at his best, but also the one liners from Alison Pill (who plays drummer of Sex Bob-omb Kim) are pure comedy gold. Also, the performance of Scott's roommate Wallace (played by Keiran Culkin) is one to watch out for.This film should be watched by everyone on the planet, a pure work of art from everyone involved!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World - LOVED IT,"This review is obviously super late in coming. However I have to say this movie was amazing. I saw the trailer on a plane and lost my mind. I knew I absolutely had to see it. However, it came and went - it flew under the radar! Anyway, I've seen it on TV, and am buying the Blu-Ray & sound track. This movie is in it's own genre, and stands all on it's own. This is a cult classic to me and should go down as such. This is one of the best live, video game flicks ever. And BTW, it not only covers gaming. It covers geeky/nerdy/hipster/pop cultures and so much more. I haven't found one person yet who doesn't love this movie. And the music was fantastic. I'm in my 40's, a geek, and I LOVE this movie. I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone played their role perfectly, the fighting and effects were great! This was an all-around fantastic flick. I only wish it would done better in the box-office so a part 2 would have come around. If one does come around, please be careful and do it right. Major kudos to everyone involved in bringing this movie to life. Thank You!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scot Pilgrim vs the World is a masterpiece that's just been born.

Surprised!,"I was surprised how awesome this movie is. I read many great reviews about it but I thought it would just be for fanboys. Well, the great reviews sucked me into this film. The moment the Universal graphic was changed into video game style, I knew I would be in for a treat.The plot is very simple. It's about one guy who has to defeat his new girlfriends seven exes in order to successfully date her.The acting is not bad actually. I don't know much about Michael Cera only previously seeing him in Juno, but he was pretty good. His roommate portrayed by Kieran Culkin gave me many laughs. Mary Elizabeth Winstead looks cute here.This is the perfect movie for everyone to see. This is mostly a drama movie with hardcore action mixed in. I hope this movie gets nominated for an Oscar or two which I doubt. It should have done better at the box office too. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film.

A creative adaptation that brings everything you love about film together,"Take every genre that can be adapted into a film, then slightly go beyond that, and you will find this film categorized under that utterly creative and unique blend. Mixed with a visual style that moves like a video game but captured into the theme of a comic, while amplified by musical exchanges that resonate like a live concert, this film is a rare compilation that manages to reach every level flawlessly, without becoming too cliché or complicated that a wide audience cant appreciate the subtle nuances that make it so imaginative. With a young cast that is superbly led by Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead but wonderfully supported by Allison Pill, Ellen Wong, Kieran Culkin and so many others, every character is essential to what makes this film so fulfilling. Yet, underneath this cinematic marvel there is also meaningful insight into relationships and love, its capacity to fail and in those rare instances succeed, even when it feels like every obstacle is in the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Horrible, Pretentious Movie","I don't get this movie. I feel that it really sucks and very seldom do I find modern cinema that fails as bad as Scott Pilgrim does while getting good ratings at the same time. Excellent rating, even. IMDb, you failed me once again.Lets first say that no wonder this movie failed horribly at the theater. The acting and the special effects were not bad. Unique, should I say. What made this movie such a bad movie is the fact that the storyline was so boring and don't make much sense.You try to find some meaning out of it but in the end it is what it is. Crap covered in chocolate. It's still crap, but hey, it looks cool.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Bold Masterpiece That Defies All Norms,"Edgar Wright is a creative genius and crafts one of the most delightful pieces of entertainment that unites a set of insanely likable, charismatic characters, a unique visual style, a truly original plot, charming dialogue, nuanced comedy, innovative editing and a soundtrack that kicks ass.The story follows Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old guitarist who plays in a not-so-successful band and who seems to stumble from one social misadventure to the next. He starts off dating a 17-year-old but is soon enraptured by purple haired Ramona Flowers who works in delivery service. However, to be with her, he first needs to defeat her seven evil exes.This set-up, although seemingly ridiculous, paves the way for a film that captivates the viewer with its colourful set designs, smart dialogue and of course its over-the-top, awesomely choreographed fight scenes with video game aesthetics. Despite the exaggeration, the story never feels forced or contrived. Instead, it flows amazingly naturally and the comedy never falls flat, which is certainly also due to the superb performances of the cast.I couldn't praise this film enough. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is one of these films that succeeds on every level. You see it once and immediately want to re-watch it. The creators obviously knew what they were doing and the result is a well-paced, highly entertaining film spiked with references to pop culture. It dares to be unconventional and geeky but never gets too absorbed in its references. The film knows when to be quiet and when to be loud but most of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously, granting an out of this world, two hour spectacle that couldn't be more epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Awesometastic!,"Do you love video games? Do you read comics? Listen to indie/alternative music and find Michael Cera tolerable, then you're going to love this! The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim, a 22 year old bass player who falls in love with a girl with a dark past that comes a'knocking soon after she responds to his courtship. The past consists of 7 evil exes that would like nothing more than to destroy Scott and pound him into dust, Scott must fight all of them in order to survive and ""get the girl"".This movie isn't for everybody, it caters to a certain audience (""Kick Ass"" lover and ""Zombieland"" fanatics who drink Redbull or Gatorade). It has a unique style that captures a video game/comic book style perfectly. Visually speaking, this movie is top notch, with many fine details to go around and an electric soundtrack to go with.Michael Cera steps out of his comfortable shell and gives a slightly different performance as the lovable Scott Pilgrim. He is funny, quirky, but not as neurotic and he looks believable as he pommels through Ramona's beefed up exes. The supporting cast is solid and there are a couple of cameos and Pop culture references for the hardcore fans out there.Overall, it's a fun, action packed comedy with solid visuals, great soundtrack (done by Beck), and it's made for an audience that most likely will wait for the DVD since they haven't been outside from the days that World of Warcraft came out, and that's a shame!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Awesomely Surreal Hilarious Comedical Thrill-Ride,"This film is amazing. With great characters, surreal special-effects and total randomness, it's packed with jokes, quotes and numerous cultural references (mostly to do with gaming.)I felt that every single part of the film was well-timed, well-placed and well-laughable (if that's a word...) Everything about it was ludicrously amusing, and I'm pretty sure that there were a couple of deep metaphors. The lines are very memorable, and off the top of my head I can quote most of the movie (I can't say the quote for fear of writing a spoiler in the review.)Having said this however, I do know some people who didn't quite get it, so I reckon it depends on your taste of humor. Someone who likes a very idiosyncratic, haphazard craziness will love this. Those who want something normal and mundane will not. A couple of moments in the film do require the viewer to ponder a little, or wonder why on earth something happened, but not in a way that makes you completely lose track; it's good or bad depending how you view it.As for comic book adaptioning, I saw the film before reading the comic (The film encouraged me to do so) and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. Some thing's are missing from the film, but most of it, down to costume, lines and special effects, is relatively the same.So, overall, watch it. You'll either love it loads or just think it's slightly weird, but only by watching it will you find out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Video Game Warrior,"One of the rarest things to ever happen to me, is finding a movie that has about everything I want, or even as a fan of a comic book for an adaptation to live up to my expectations. This film does that just like the graphic comic mini series it was derived from it is a film I feel was made for me.This film just has so much that one watch just isn't enough. The action is great it is well filmed just old fashioned style (which I prefer) where you can see the hits as well as who's hitting who. It is well choreographed, it really looks like a video game or even comic book/anime come to life. From the visual effects and sound when we see the attacks delivered down to the power moves. Just seeing this makes me wonder why the hell the live action ""Street Fighter"" movies couldn't of pulled this off.This also creates sort of a fantasy world, kinda like with the show's ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" and the underrated ""Community"" or even the video games ""Earthbound"" and the ""Persona"" series. It's a world that is one foot in reality but also just one foot away, everyone acts as though what is going on is all a part of everyday life. I love those kinds of fantasy worlds because their more accessible and feel as though anything to even a random everyday person is possible. The music is also great most to all of the songs are memorable, two of my favorites are the theme song and Threshold. But what really gives this movie power is in it's dialog and characters.The dialog and humor is just hilarious, this film is one of those rare movies where sometimes by re watching you can uncover something new, sometimes I find a joke that might of went over my head, that just makes the film all the more funnier. There is also a great amount of reference jokes much like in ""Futurerama"" and ""South Park"", from video games like ""Street Fighter"", ""Double Dragon"", movies like ""The Warriors"", you name it it's there.Characters even the minor ones are all great and I felt cast just right. Even though for the record I'm not a fan of the actor, Michael Cera I thought did very well as the character, I really felt like he was Scott Pilgrum. What I love about Scott is just how relatable he is, Scott is a bit like myself in real life; he's shy, insecure, ill confidant but not short of courage, loves video games, and trying to find himself. I also love the fact that Scott looks like any other everyday person, he's not some stereotypical pretty boy, this helped in the relatablity.Mary Elesebeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Ramona Flowers, I've always imagined that actress's voice when I read the series, so her playing Ramona is a dream come true. She is hotter than hell (in my book anyway)and capable actress to boot. Ramona is feisty, fiery, spontaneous, rebellious, bitchy (I mean that in a good way) despite these things she's capable of warmth and mature, and like Scott is also trying to find herself (heck her changing hair color reflects that).I love the chemistry between the two it's one of those rare examples of a romance when done the right way, because it feels true to what I've been though with my significant other. Like the moment both first met in an awkward conversation, that's happened to me because what do you say to a girl you've just met, it's not like there are guidelines. The conversations they have with one another and the time they spend together, it just feels right you know both are right for one another and you want them together.Like the minor character Knives Chaou played by Ellen Wong whom is also hotter than hell and a capable actress hoping she gets more in the future. Knives is 17 (though in reality the actress is 25) she's young, full of energy, sweet, has some fire in her which we see in the final fight, a bit immature though I don't mind. The way the film handled her I could of gone either way (though on a side note I like Ramona even more but that's just me) but we know who the right one is so it makes sense who Scott chooses in the end.The villains are all colorful, just like in a ""Street Fighter"" video game each have different abilities to do serious damage. However all of them are unlikeable, their just all dirt bags with a capital D, their the kind of people that have pushed me around in my middle school, man did I hate them; all the more reason we want Scott to win.The film has multiple themes, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film as the situation progresses Scott becomes more of a man and Ramona becomes more of a woman. For Scott it's doing things for yourself as well being more than what you are if you want things to get better, Scott's life has always been on hold because he wasn't doing what he should be doing, but once he stepped up to plate that's when life got better. Ramona it's finding what she needed as opposed to what she thinks she wants. All of her evil exes had one thing in common they didn't give her what she really needed, Scott was able to give her what she needed which is kindness, warmth, and understanding. All the more reason why he's right for her.Well that's all I have to say, Scott Pilgrim is an epic, well sort of.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I Grew Tired Very Quickly,"Maybe, I am getting too old, maybe, this is a part of subculture that I do not grab or embrace, maybe this is that comic book culture that we did not and largely do not have here in Russia, but one thing for sure and this is this: Scott Pilgrim is a really utter rubbish, awful nonsense and a terrible fetid crazy kaleidoscope of whatever which makes you feel tired, dizzy, angry and laughing at the same time. The film presents a very impressive crew of great actors, such Micheal Sere or Kieran Culkin, or a very sweet Mary Elizabeth Winsteadm but what we have is a headache and a very silly mix of all unimaginably poor comics and a very shallow plot that can appeal only to very young, green, immature and silly willy kids who know no life. This is a bright wrapping with no real candy underneath, nay, it is empty and vapid inside. Scott Pilgrim fails to entertain, to deliver message, to excite or thrill. Insread, we witness a bad, poor, shallow, mediocre broth with no meat, only thin layer of some fat on top. Poor and miserable",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The new blade runner,"OK, I see all those bad reviews about this movie, but you guys are insane! If you guys thought this would be a philosophical movie, you are wrong. This is a movie for the Nintendo generation, with lots and lots of pop culture references, and not a movie that makes you question the world. I'm 13, but I'm a huge cinephile, so I watched lots and lots of great and acclaimed movies, and by far this is one of the best I've ever seen. The edition of this movie is the best ever. I just can't believe you guys disliked this film. Come on, the way Edgar Wright turned the graphic novel (that you should read, by the way) into a movie is incredible. I felt like I was in a video game, or inside a comic book. The songs, the battles, everything! In my opinion, this movie is the new Blade Runner... In 10 years you'll all regret what you said about it. I can't write much more than this, because this movie is just indescribable.

Scott Pilgrim rocks the world!,"Scott Pilgrim vs the World is similar to Kick-Ass with references to the comic book world and the pacing and tone of the film where it takes you by the balls and goes on one heck of a roller-coaster ride and blows off any expectations you have of it. No doubt with the sequel of Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall (A brilliant title if I might add) will produce the same hopefully. The one difference between Scott Pilgrim and Kick-Ass is that Pilgrim is more tame and not as violent and crude. But it is still excellent.Scott Pilgrim vs the world won't be to everyone's taste as I found out when I took my fifty year old father to see it with me. Director Edgar Wright previously responsible for the hilarious Hot Fuzz with Simon Pegg and Shaun of the Dead (though I've never seen it). I believe he has specifically targeted a younger audience with this movie. It's highly unlikely (though not impossible) that anyone over thirty will enjoy it. And even then there are those who wouldn't enjoy this film as it won't be everyone's cup of tea, which is fair enough. But I did love this.From the start it's clear to me that Wright goes for a more visual and style movie more than substance, but this isn't a bad thing. Comic strip words fly across the scene at different angles and speeds and makes the experience more vibrant. With that coming with the excellent action sequences makes it even more exhilarating. It's wacky, nuts and over the top, but it's so much fun, it left me on a buzz, Through the comic element of the film comes numerous references to the pop and rock culture and old computer video games. But also it's hilariously funny. Thanks to a good script, which has moments of wit. The comic timing with Micheal Cera as Scott and particularly his gay roommate Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) is perfect, which brings me onto the acting. Micheal Cera makes a capable enough lead and he has a certain charm for the character. He even looks impressive when fighting Romana's evil ex's, but for some reason I couldn't help thinking he looked more fifteen than twenty two. The other actor who I really liked was Kieran Culkin. He gave for me the most and best laughs and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau who plays Scott's first girlfriend before he meets Romana was entertaining to watch.Initially some of the problems I had with this film and stopped short of giving it a ten for a start is Mary Elizabeth Winstead who played Romana, she was okay, but I just didn't like her performance much and she looked bored for most of this. Another problem is the lack of character development. I could never really believe that Scott really loved Romana. There isn't really much chemistry between them and the film fails to have an heart or charm when it comes to their relationship. I could see in a couple of moments between them that the movie tries to be touching, but it fails and just comes across as shallow. However they do look cute together so at least that is something. The story also is quite predictable where Scott has to defeat Romana's seven evil ex's in order to win her heart.However I'm not going to put this down to much as I generally loved it overall. So much so I had the biggest grin on my face afterwards and it stayed on my face for so long I began to wonder if I would ever be able to change my facial expression. In the end Scott Pilgrim rocked my world and if your under thirty and want to see something wacky or have a fondness for the comic strip genre. You will love this. Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one of the most refreshing and original films to come out this year. An exhilarating blast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A movie that created its own insane world and loved every second of it,"Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one of those rare movies of today that actually tried something new and original in today's movie market of formula and repetition. It may not be a film everyone may enjoy but for those who can get by the ridiculous idea will have one of the most enjoyable movie experiences out there.The plot behind this bizarre tale is based on the seven volume independent developed graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley in which Scott Pilgrim runs into the girl of his dreams Ramona Flowers but Ramona is carrying more baggage then Scott is used to. Baggage in the form of seven evil exes; ( I say exes since Ramona had six ex boyfriends and one ex girlfriend this is the 21st century after all) So Scott must defeat all her exes in order to be with Ramona and this is where it gets weird.For reasons unquestioned and unexplained by anyone Scotts world seems to inhabit the world of video game logic. All said characters seem to have some sort of super power or magical weapon, they go head to head in video game boss fight / fighting game style, with a system that keeps score gives one ups and where the loser bursts in a shower of coins.All this may sound like it panders to a certain audience, and it does on top of the evil ex fights the movie is filled with references and sound effects thrown in from a generation of video games. But I still feel that this a movie that people outside the video game trend can watch. What I find to be Scott Pilgrims biggest strength is how self aware it is with its absurd premise; It continually knows through out that this is a silly prospect for a movie so it plays more for laughs then to be taken straight faced. Almost every line of dialogue is building up to a punch line or just being intentionally funny, even the fights are there for comedy rather then tension. But I don't mean to undersell the fight scenes they are still awesome to watch amongst all the hilarity going on.My only real problem with this picture is while good taking a seven volume graphic novel and condensing it to just under two hours really doesn't do the work justice. Some of the characters don't get as much screen time a lot of the story has been cut down not to mention the change in the ending. However even with these flaws I still give the movie a perfect 10 cause the scenes and characters we do see are still well developed. Besides I don't think you can do much better for a seven volume comic book condensed into just two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Truly Hip to Be Square,"Could it really be possible? Could one movie company really release two movies in under two months deserving of my greatest accolade: a perfect score? I don't give them out easily, many times feeling at least one little thing was out of place or lacking in the overall composition of the film, but almost in back-to-back form Universal Studios has made their mark on the summer with the release of one of the most anticipated comic book adaptations of the summer (at least by a small group of fanboys and fangirls).Scott Pilgrim vs. The World brings to life the tale of an adorably square hipster/bass player named Scott Pilgrim. While trying to mend his broken heart and shake his unwelcomed status of 'dump-ee', he dreams about a punk-chic on roller blades and his world trips down the rabbit hole when he finds that the dream girl is real. Compelled to court her, he discovers that to win her companionship he must defeat in battle her seven evil Ex's, each still equally enchanted and desperate for the love of this oddly endearing young girl.While so many things came together in perfect harmony here, for the first time in a long while, first credit and top billing for the success needs to go to the man on top of the totem pole, director Edgar Wright. Erupting from the mind that brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (plus the equally amazing, but woefully less well-known, Spaced), Scott Pilgrim displays the same skill and amazing amounts of research into the genre, which helped transform his earlier efforts into trophy case pieces of what makes a great film. So many tiny moments, pixelated pop-ups and even audio reminders of the original Nintendo generation helped shape the universe of Pilgrim into one we not only believed in, but recognized from our youth. The tone, the atmosphere, even the overly romanticized quest, it all hearkens back to the roots of comic book caricature mixed with action hero devotion. Without diving into too much more detail and turning this into a novella of wonderment about Wright and his talents, I will just say that as the captain of this ship, he steered brilliantly and I would very much like to see him awarded for it, even if that seems unlikely (although with a 10 movie Best Picture category, it's not impossible).Moving on to those lucky souls who got to inhabit these wonderful characters, it is a pantheon of young Hollywood elite who earn each and every second of their on-screen glory. Michael Cera, once dangerously on the verge of over-exposure and being perennially typecast, has surged back with his touchingly awkward, yet awesomely heroic rendition of the lead, Scott Pilgrim. This time Cera really feels like he is fully in touch with his capabilities and embraces the geek charm which many were beginning to feel was holding him back and turning him into a cultural antique before its time. What was also great is no one would really find a fight scene with Michael Cera truly believable in a normal world, but the world of Scott Pilgrim is legions away from normal. Blending comic book candor, anime stylings and 8-bit video game action gave Cera a universe he could truly become the nerd warrior of our fantasies. As the woman of his quirky and vivid dreams, Mary Elizabeth Winstead delights as Ramona Flowers, creating one of those tragically cute girls all men want to win and make happy for the rest of their days. She also tiptoes down that tightrope between confidence and cowardice, showing humanity in its most simple and pure form. Peppering the outskirts of this incredibly creative world, much can be said about the co-stars and side characters. Amazing on all counts, they helped firm up the reality of the world by embracing their individual quirks and all playing in that same wonderful tone. A special mention needs to go out to Kieran Culkin, who played Pilgrim's sexually voracious gay roommate. His darkly comic timing and constant calling of 'bullsh*t' to the rest of the characters helped keep the story from spiraling off into a cartoonish purgatory.Anyone who owned the original Nintendo should love this film. This is made specifically for you. As for the rest of the world, there is heart and humor to be had, but it might get lost on you behind the screen of random quick edits and constant cultural in-jokes. It has not gotten its due in the box office, but I guarantee this will become a cult classic on the DVD market. I'm already dusting off a space on my shelf for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A disappointing mess.,"This film marks an event in Wrights directing career, as I believe he has finally run out of talented crew and production personnel's coat tails to ride on.Scott Pilgrim should have been awesome, it had all the right elements, hot girls, martial arts, good soundtrack, and yet Wright failed massively.The mixture of styles on screen doesn't look eclectic and innovative, it just looks like a 'throw everything at it' mess.The fight scenes are the most disappointing element. The directing is boring and bumbles along at a single pace. There are no 'wow' shots or unexpected turns, it's like watching The House of Flying Daggers if it had been storyboarded by an infomercial director.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
In the land of pixels and make believe...,"One day, I saw a headline about the trailer to 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' being released. When I watched it, I was entranced by it. It was fast, flashy, and funny and when I finally saw the movie, those three words are exactly the way I'd describe the final product.The film starts with about 15 minutes of quick cuts and snappy dialogue and if it makes you nauseous, shut the film off. But really, that's two of the many things I must praise the film for. Its editing sets the film at a break neck speed and stays that way throughout the film. There's no down time and the director, Edgar Wright, packs every second of it with references so small yet so effective that one must be hyper aware if they want to catch them all. The best part about all of these references is that they all fall into the script flawlessly. They never strain it. The other thing that could turn you away is that most of the characters are very cynical but if you're like me (a somewhat cruel teenager,) you'll find it very funny.Another thing this movie does brilliantly is how it juggles genres. It has action, comedy, romance, and even a scene that has a musical number and the cast pulls it off perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is beautiful and tough as the mysterious Ramona Flowers and the evil exes are all delightfully despicable. People have been heaping praise on Ellen Wong with her portrayal of Knives Chau, the insane stalker ex-girlfriend of Scott Pilgrim. For a new comer, she's very good, but I was annoyed by her, maybe because I know all too many people like that in real life. However, that's the idea with the character and she does it very well. Personally, I think the best actress in the film is Alison Pill as the drummer Kim Pine. Really the biggest problem with the cast is Michael Cera. Yes, he's playing only a slightly more animated version of the character he's played in every other movie he's done. While this isn't a huge gripe as it does kind of fit the role, he just doesn't offer much new and it leaves us annoyed.Okay, I got off topic back there. As I was saying, the movie juggles genres perfectly. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, this film has it. If you like action films, this movie's got it. Hell, if you're a fan of anime, musicals, or flashy effects, this film has it! It's Edgar Wright at his best, as before he's handled three genres at the most. Now he's handling every genre but horror, although if you like his style, there's his past film 'Shaun of the Dead' that covers that. It's just one of those films that anyone can enjoy.I also suggest the comic series. They expand on the story that the film has. Really, you watch the movie to get the basic idea of the concept of Scott Pilgrim and you read the series to learn more about it. I'm saying you shouldn't watch the film. Quite the opposite, really. One should read the books for the story and watch the movie for the artistry that went into the film making.In the end, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is a fantastic movie. It has beautiful visuals, a lightning fast pace that you either latch on to and follow for the whole thing or just can't catch up with, and a lot of energy from all who are involved.And as a side note, for anyone complaining about the ending, GUYS, it's a fairy tale. How else would it end?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The boy who had the b*lls to challenge the world,"I wonder if you remember the short by Pixar named ""When day meets night"". There was a voice at the radio which said ""People are afraid of changements, people fear everything that is not usual"". I think this sentence perfectly fits the situation. Why hasn't Scott Pilgrim been a success at the box office? The answer's very simple: Because it's too different. What about a ""pee bar"" that empties little by little as the protagonist piddles? Mhm...too ingenious for we poor people that think Avatar is the maximum the world of cinema can give us.I do not care what many people could think (and many reviewers, I outta add), Scott Pilgrim deserves (or maybe deserved) a great success. Because it is something new, something that anybody had never seen before then I'd award it even just for that. We shoulda go watching this kind of movies, because so doing we would show the Hollywood world that we viewers need something more than the usual Blockbuster.Anyway, I'd give this movie a 10 stars rating. At first for its protagonist, Michael Cera. Oh my God, his performance has stroke me so much that made me think I'd be gay for him (lol). Even all the others characters, so fascinating, original and histerically funny. The character played by Chris Evans, who perfectly fits his role, is in my opinion the best of the seven evil exes. Elizabeth Mary Winstead adds a little drop that doubles the value of the cast.There are a lot of brainwaves (Do you remember in the first teaser trailer ""What are you doing? - I'm getting' a life!"") which make this movie pretty precious. Colorful and funny even in its smallest detail, it reminded me of the graphic novel the story comes from, adding some elements we often find in videogames.Finally, I rally in support of this movie because I think it deserved much more than what it is getting at the box office. Come on, go watching this movie or maybe someday the industrial world of cinema will be still thinking that another Avatar is always better than something new and then risky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Crazy. Amazing. Retro and Funny.,"This movie really deserves to be watched at least twice to appreciate it even more. I'm glad I'd never heard of this movie because it didn't give me any prejudice. I saw a preview and thought ""that looks silly"" which is probably why it didn't do well at the Box Office. First of all, this is visual art at its' best. For a movie buff, this movie highlights some really creative approaches to telling a story in a nutty but entertaining manner. Secondly, many of the retro sounds, characters and effects were an enjoyable throw back to my childhood with remnants of Donkey Kong, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Mario Brothers and more. The pace varies between mostly fast and brief tidbits of slow which made a mockery of typical film presentation and this was a bonus.Overall, this is unique, visually impressive, presses retro buttons, heaps of fun and I've got to say, musically rocks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

A veritable zeitgeist of pop-cultures mashing up against each other.,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a veritable zeitgeist of pop-cultures mashing up against each other to deliver a romance unlike anything we'll likely see for the next decade.A great comic book is made up of a delicate blend of artwork and storyline that leaps off the page. With comic books adapted for the screen already having made said leap, they must do more than simply use the source material as a storyboard – a vibe must be captured, some kind of sync between the creator and the director must be demonstrated, an evocation of nostalgia for the reader of the comic must be stirred and ideally, those not familiar with the material will be swept away onto the bandwagon. Edgar Wright manages to hit all of the above-mentioned notes to create a Torontonian experience unlike any other, blending elements of comic books, video games, indie music, and most importantly, movies.Chances are, you've met a guy kind of like Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera); a likable slacker who is lucky and clumsy with the ladies, and plays bass in a mediocre indie band. Scott is taking some time off from serious relationships by spending his time with a high school girl 6 years his junior when he meets the girl of his dreams, literally. Ramona Flowers (the completely unrecognizable Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a roller blading courier for Amazon.ca, recently transplanted from the United States, has been taking a subspace shortcut through Scott's subconscious. When he finally meets her face to face, he is instantly smitten, and Ramona soon warms to his less awkward than usual Michael Cera-esquire charms. There's only one problem, Ramona's got some skeletons in her closet. Skeletons covered in muscles, flesh and clothing with crouching tiger kung fu skills in the form of Ramona's ex-boyfriends (and girlfriend, rrrrraow!). Turns out that if Scott wants to be with Ramona, he'll have to defeat the League of Evil Exesand maybe even clean up some of his own messes while he's at it. Fortunately, Scott is the number one rated fighter in all of Ontario, so he can handle them. (It might not say so in the movie, but trust me, it's in the books.) (Besides, the fights are just allegorical for the personal issues Scott and Ramona have to lay to rest before they can get together, so why does it matter whether this 98 pound weakling can nail a 64 hit mid-air combo?) The first thing you'll notice about this movie is the pre-credit Universal logo, rendered in glorious 8-bit like a Donkey King table top at your favourite seedy tavern. And with that, the tone is set for the next two hours. Just about everything hat unfolds on screen, from the bathroom breaks to the high scores in the aftermath of each skirmish is coloured with the same playful Nintendo brush. Edgar Wright, the mad scientist behind such genre benders/blenders as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead has proved himself to be positively soaked in the language of cinema. And I don't mean the techniques of Orson Welles or Jean-Luc Godard, I mean every pop-culture gem of the last 20 or even 30 years. He understands exactly how we glean information off the silver screen and he's devised his own cinematic shorthand to deliver that information faster and funnier than anyone else. It's the kind of style that comes in handy adapting a book that tends to express itself in images in feelings more than thoughts and words.What is at the heart of its triumph, besides its innate sense of fun, is the tension/conflict/torsion between Toronto's reality in which it is so cozily nested with locations like Lee's Palace, Casa Loma and Pizza Pizza, and the fighting flights of fancy as Scott engages in fisticuffs that are one half Street Fighter 2 and one half Dance Dance Revolution. The mundane and the magical collide with each other to a deftly handled soundtrack as only a music lover like Wright could deliver.With all of this bombast going on, it's easy to forget that this really is a love story. And that is perhaps where I find this movie's only shortcoming. Even if it's Wright's scrambled take on the ""boy meets girl"" story, there needed to be a tender heart to this take, and that is what Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is lacking. Everything is just too neon & plastic – and perhaps that's the point. Perhaps Wright was trying to make a statement of the transitory nature of young modern love or perhaps Wright's directed a little too much bromance and not enough romance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Incredibly PERFECT!,"I never thought i would put a pure 10 without hesitation to a new released movie. But yes, this one deserves it. I won't say anything about any scene or the plot. I will talk generally for this movie. Why? Because its an experience and if i talk i will spoil it. Stop reading reviews and go watch it. I started watching it, like ""what the hell"" and ended up with a permanent smile that i can't wipe out even after 3 days. This is one of the worst periods of my life people. I have broken up with my girlfriend, i am too stressed with my College, i am looking for a job and let's say that this is not the best time i had in my life. This movie gave me back the smile i lost, when nothing else could!This movie is one of the best i have ever seen, because it touches you deeply. It is exceptional. It is fresh. It is genuine. It is mostly fun! It is for everyone. I can't think of a movie that i would enjoy more to watch at a cinema or at my living room, with friends. This was a revelation and i wanna share my opinion with the world.By the way, i can see some people judge in a way they show me that they MISS THE POINT! A few examples:""...forgets about keeping it real"" Oh, really? So in your opinion a movie MUST look like reality or what? Or 4/10? Can you really believe that people? Why then watch a movie? Watch reality from a balcony.""...childish..no message that its trying to convey."" Aims also and mostly at adult audiences. Period. And i strongly disagree, it has plenty of messages.""All flash, no substance."" Excuse me???? I strongly disagree. Did you actually saw the movie or did you people copy - paste something you just read about it?""leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable."" Another 2/10 that shows me that even he was sleeping before the movie ended, or he doesn't... oh forget about it....Some guys (as i read at another review) even complained for making the audience laugh too much?

"not for everyone, but definitely for me","This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The fast paced direction and witty one- liners make this an actual comic book movie, not just a movie based on a comic book. The second the movie starts, the viewer is bombarded with crazy sights and sounds. Video game- like music and hilarious banter between establishes what kind of movie this is. As the story develops, it gets more unpredictable and hilarious. Every single performance is perfect and hilarious, from Michael Cera as Scott to Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate. The only problem with the movie is that it has a fairly specific target audience, and I can definitely see people outside that demographic finding this movie. Go see it if you're below the age of 30, enjoy video game references, don't mind ADDish editing, and enjoy indie rock music. If fit in the target demographic, you probably won't be able to describe how awesome it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I'm honestly thrilled that day happened.I was certainly not expecting this movie to be how it was. The premise of it was ridiculous - so much so it was amazing. If you don't look at this movie from a ""WTF? What kind of reality is this?"" kind of way, you will think it is amazing too. The fight scenes are incredible, as are the actors. Michael Cera is, in my personal opinion, his best in this movie. This is the movie where I fell in love with him. Everyone else was awesome as well.I suggest to everyone to watch this movie - adults and younger ones as well (although not too young, there are some small sexual scenes...). Younger ones will enjoy the action and adults will also enjoy the video game references from way back when. Make sure to actually watch this movie because it moves fast and requires one hundred percent attention. otherwise, things will be missed.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) - This Video Game is Addictive!,"A retelling of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel, hits the big screen. At first, I thought the movie was going to be some random movie with weird elements. The strangest thing, I never even read the graphic novel. But when I started to know more about the story and its elements, that made me want to see it, and made me change my mind! The film tells the story of Scott Pilgrim, who falls in love with a mysterious girl, but he must fight for her love, by defeating all of her seven ex-boyfriends, ""The Evil X's"", to be exact! The film was an excellent piece about fighting for love, and the film was like playing a video game. The whole film had the neatest cast that includes Michael Cera, Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, & Jason Schwartzman. Michael Cera made a funny performance in the title role, that made me laugh at times, and it was easy to cheer him on! Although sharing a pretty good chemistry with his co-star, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, this movie is more of a stylish action-comedy, than it is a romance. Also, the film had both awesome visual effects and amazing graphics that made the movie into a hand-held video game. Filled with stylish cinematography, and gorgeous editing, it's nearly impossible not to smile! Every scene is filled with such memorabilia to pay tribute to the many classic video games out there. You want find a movie like this anywhere else, I promise you that! Many elements of the storyline has it's own visual style, and it's really impressive! This film is one of the most awesome movies I had ever seen, and made me want to play more video games, or maybe not! This is a ridiculously enjoyable film that I hope I'll see again soon, and it's also one of the best movies of 2010. You don't have to be a video game fan to like this movie, this is also a tribute to those who are a fan of film. Go check it out, if you haven't seen it!

Just Plain Dumb,"My family and I just watched this film and within the first few minutes, I could see why this movie bombed at the box office. We forced ourselves to watch it to the end, and we all agreed that we just lost a couple of hours of our life that we will never get back. To try and describe just how much this movie sucked is difficult. I like Edgar Wright's films, and I like Michael Cera, and Jason Scwartzman, so to see them in this ridiculously stupid film was especially painful. Nothing about the movie made any sense, and there is nothing even remotely redeeming about it. I have posted on Twitter and Facebook about how terrible this film is in order to hopefully save my friends from having to endure this mess of a film. Sometimes films tank at the box office and they are good films, but this time the audience got it right by not paying to see this disaster in theaters. Lucky for us, we got it via Netflix so the dollars we wasted on this nightmare were minimal. Avoid this mess and you will be glad you did.

The entire movie in fact is a wonderful blend of video game culture, hipster culture, and pop culture in general. The indie rock locations, the 8-bit music, the garage band music, the arcade action sequences, the quirky comedy (but not in the usual nails-on-a-chalkboard way you see in other hipster comedies).

Amazing,"After seeing some bad reviews, I thought this movie needed more good reviews to offset it.I am a 48 year old person, so not a kid. I grew up with video games though. I mean, from Pong to the latest Tomb Raider game, I have played countless games. This would give the movie a favorable bias to me vs. someone who is not into video games.It's not a teen movie, IMO. Remember, the guy is like 22.Is is a movie about relationships gone bad, emotional baggage, insecurity and other important topics. Is the plot good? I thought so. Just assume the movie is a bit allegorical, and it makes sense, at least to me.The main character is probably not to everyone's taste. The love interest is a bit blah - not sure why they did not give her more personality. But some of the support characters are amazing. His roommate was amazing - loved his character. The female member of his band did such a great job and had such a good character, I can't imagine her being better.The fights are of course stylized and influenced by video games. You just have to accept that the movie is a fantasy of sorts. Don't try to insert logic into it.There's some very funny scenes. Not all the dialog is amazing, but a lot of it IS amazing and funny.The characters in many cases responded to situations realistically when the situation was something we all may have experienced. In cases where the situation was completely different than reality, the characters usually acted like this was totally normal - I found that to be a great approach. Their world was normal, except for the occasional video game style battle - why not?I could understand some people won't get the humor. The movie dares to be a bit different, and as such won't fit into some people's conceptions, and that will result in them hating the movie. I don't think you can blame the movie.There's a few things that didn't make too much sense to me, but didn't hurt the overall movie.I found it thoroughly refreshing and enjoyable. I dare say there were even some lessons to be learned from Scott's journey.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Ehmm why do people say this is brilliant ???,I had very high hopes when reading the various reviews and i normally like the actors when they play in other films. The story starts slow and it is the same over the whole movie and that 7 times.. Its nice when they try new things in movies that is the only aspect which i think is nice but to be honest after 10 minutes i thought i was back watching the old batman series. And in my opinion i did not really bring anything extra to the screen/story the fighting parts are nice but after one you've seen them all. There are some good things about this film and some interaction between the actors was very good and also the lead was done OK.

But if this movie were totally terrible in every way but visually, I would still say it's worth it for the effects alone. The crazy blend of comic textures and live action, little sound effects. As they say, the devil is in the details, and the people who worked on this movie were tuned into those minute things that make a movie great.
What can I say about the plot, maybe the end loses the slightest bit of steam, but more movies nail the opening than nail the ending. What I can say is, if you've ever played in a (preferably crappy) band, it'll hit you in the heart.

The videogame effects are extraordinary.The acting is a bit sloppy, but I guess that's the point considering Scott and Ramona are relatively awkward people. Aubrey Plaza was her sarcastic self, obviously. Brie Larson was amazing as Envy and I will be blasting her cover of Black Sheep until I pass of old age.The soundtrack is stellar.

Pure fun and entertainment!,"¨Every Pilgrim reaches the end of its journeysome sooner than others.¨ I can guarantee you one thing about Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: It is like no other film you have seen in 2010. You might love it or hate it, but it definitely won't be for its lack of originality. What some viewers may find off-putting are the eye-candy arcade style visuals, which I really enjoyed and found original. I completely loved this movie and was rooting for Scott Pilgrim all the way. This film is as close as anyone will get at adapting a graphic novel. Some scenes felt as if I were passing the pages of the comic book itself since it was full of texts throughout the action sequences (Zombieland tried this successfully last year as well). British director, Edgar Wright (of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame), successfully adapted the screenplay along with Michael Bacall, in order to bring Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novel to the big screen. The visuals, the action sequences, and the soundtrack are all highly entertaining, but what I really enjoyed the most in this film were the characters. The film moves at a really fast pace and it is surprising how much stuff they get into this movie in only two hours. It brought me so many different sensations at the same time: I felt like I was playing an arcade game, watching a live concert, and reading a graphic novel all at once. There are so many talented actors as well, but I will get into that in the next paragraph. All I can say is that director Edgar Wright keeps on demonstrating that he can make highly entertaining and fun films one after another, and isn't afraid of taking risks. He always goes all in and pushes the boundaries of filmmaking.For those of you who aren't familiar with the graphic novel I will introduce you briefly to the plot and characters. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-two year old who is in between jobs at the moment, living with his gay roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and currently dating a seventeen year old named Knives (Ellen Wong). She is slowly becoming obsessed with him, but he seems to be enjoying her company as they hang out mostly in the arcades. Scott is also the bass player for a small band called Sex Bob-Omb along with Kim (Alison Pill), Stephen (Mark Webber), and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons). Scott is still trying to get over the girl that broke his heart, Envy Adams (Brie Larson), who has now become a famous pop star. It has been a year since he was dumped, but now things begin to be looking all right for Scott and his relationship with Knives. That is until Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) shows up and Scott falls head over heels for her. Ramona is the girl of his dreams and it is love at first sight for Scott Pilgrim. She doesn't seem to be interested in him at first, but Scott manages to get a date with her and she gives him a chance. The only problem is that Ramona comes with some heavy baggage and in order to date her he will have to defeat her seven evil ex lovers: Matthew (Satya Bhabha), Lucas (Chris Evans), Roxy (Mae Whitman), Todd (Brandon Routh), the Katayanagi twins (Shota Saito and Keita Saitou), and Gideon (Jason Schwartzman). To make matters worse he also has to face Knives and let her know that he is in love with someone else.The cast is absolutely amazing. Michael Cera is great in the lead role and he plays his usual self although this time around he can fight really well. He has to face two ex superheroes: Superman (Brandon Routh) and the Human Torch (Chris Evans), who actually have pretty funny and entertaining scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is gorgeous in this movie and it's also love at first sight with her. Jason Schwartzman is always entertaining too watch as well. However the person who really steals every scene he's in actually is Kieran Culkin who gives a terrific and funny performance as Wallace. I really fell in love with these characters and with the movie as well. The dialogue is very witty and funny, the visuals are stunning and really fast paced, the soundtrack is incredible, and I really loved the video game effects introduced in the movie. The story also served as a metaphor for love. Just like Scott we too have to face the evil exes of the person we love if we want to win their heart. If we can't manage to make them forget about their past they will never want to move on with you. I thought it was an interesting metaphor anyways. It's not a film you can take seriously, but it is one of the reasons why we love to go to the movies: Its pure fun and entertaining.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
A Matter of Experience,"I reckon this has to be a polarizing film, seeing how Wright chooses to make sure there is very little middle ground to tread on. But, hey, I love polarizing films as long as I'm on the right side of polarization.Rarely have I enjoyed a film experience so much as I enjoyed this one, thanks mainly to the excellent blend of fantasy, adventure and...realism. It covers the essential basis of tangency and then takes you through a fantastic journey of self-discovery and bemused romance. Particularly if you're transitioning from teenage-hood to adulthood, when the ""real world"" starts catching up with you really fast, this is something that allows you to take your mind off things, to find refuge in a faithfully familiar place.The story of Scott Pilgrim, our oh-so-subtly named protagonist (like so many other characters, actually), describes a fairly restless and isolated guy, who happens to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. Literally, as she turns out to be very much alive and kicking. Yet, everything about her is dreamlike, from the snow melting under her roller blades to her eccentric way of being and becoming. As with every fantasy world, there are a few obstacles involved in conquering the fair lady, in this case manifested through the presence of seven evil exes that need to be defeated. So Scott has to get through this series of challenges in arcade style match-ups, as if it were that simple to get what you've always dreamed of. Can't say though that the thought never crossed my mind.The film's comic sense is sometimes ridiculous, but it always seemed fulfilling. Regarding the actors, Michael Cera is enjoyable, even though I'd say Kieran Culkin was the more delightful actor to watch - or Ellen Wong, who portrayed her character in a virtuous Japanese anime style. Clearly however, a dreamlike central figure like Mary Elizabeth Winstead was essential to the well-being of Scott Pilgrim and I reckon she was an excellent choice, even without needing to do too much to affirm herself.Ultimately the film captures the spirit it is trying to convey so very well, that spirit of a naive and noisy youth, filled with cultural and pseudo-cultural pillars of reference. If you can resonate with this (as I assume anyone who still has some vague memory of teenage years can), with all that is implied by the bizarre and childish world it creates, then this has to be an experience worth trying out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Only one word is necessary ... Fantastic!,"Oh my God! This movie completely took me by surprise. I had thought it to be just another teen comedy, but was I in for a surprise.This movie is so far out there, so extreme in every way, but it all works so well. There is so much weird stuff going on all throughout the movie, and you just sit there trying to take it all in. From the very beginning, where you had the Universal logo and music coming at you in 8-bit sound, that simply laid the line for what you were in for. A movie in the extremes. A movie that rocked. And a movie that will blow you away.The story is good and fast paced, a weird, but sweet romantic tale, if you will. And you throw in a lot of, oddly enough, really cool fight scenes, cool CGI effects, quirky characters and lots of comedy, then you have ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" fairly much summarized. Plus there is a bunch of really, really cool cameo appearances. And you also have a good amount of fairly nice music. Not personally the type of music I listen to, but still, it worked very well for the movie.I was laughing throughout the movie, especially at the scene where Knives came asking for Scott unannounced, and he jumped out the window. It was by far the best scene ever!The cast in ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" is very good, lots of really awesome performances being put on here. And people portray their characters with passion and a lot of believability. And it is hard to say who stood out here, because everyone was really adding their own unique touch to the movie. And the cameo appearances also spice up the movie quite a lot.This movie is definitely a keeper for the DVD collection. And it is so far out there and bizarre that is most definitely have repeated watch-value. This is not the type of movie you just watch once and put it away, never to see it again.I stumbled on this movie by sheer luck, and I am very grateful for having found and seen it. This is definitely a movie you just have to watch!Fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Not perfect, but still a win!","When Scott Pilgrim meets Ramona Flowers, he discovers he has to defeat her seven 'evil exes' to win her heart...Edgar Wright, who made two of the most enjoyable films of the past few years, Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, here tackles the ever-growing comic book film adaptation. And for the most part he has succeeded.I will state now I've not read the comic books the film is based on. But taking the film as is, it is very enjoyable. The script is very funny, the supporting cast, lead by Kieran Culkin, Brandon Routh, Chris Evans and others are all very good indeed. But the key to the film working are Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the leads.For this film to work you have to care about Scott and Ramona. If you don't then you don't care what happens to them. And while both characters have qualities that could make them unlikeable, thanks to the performances of Cera and Winstead, you do find them appealing, if flawed characters.But the film itself is not without flaws, and these fall on some decisions by Edgar Wright. While it moves at a quick pace, with some excellent set-pieces, including the fight scenes, it's the use of visual aids on screen that at times is a problem. Because I've not read the comic books, it is possible they work in that format, if used there, but in the film I did find them distracting at times.But this is a small issue. The film has a great soundtrack, and as stated, is very funny and full of energy, and while not up to the level of Kick-Ass, which I found more enjoyable overall, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is much, much better than Iron Man 2 in this years comic book films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim Ramona Flower's evil ex's in one of the best movies of the summer,"This really was the surprise of the summer.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is easily the best comedy of the summer and I would say even arguably the best movie of the summer. The humor is very clever, but this was to be expected coming from the director of both Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The acting was also very well executed. Michael Cera is his usual character, but he is still hilarious, as are his friends and the evil ex's that he has to fight throughout the film.Stylistically this movie is like none other that I have ever seen before, in the sense that it looks like a comic book/video game throughout the entire movie, but it does not go over the top. Because this execution was not over the top, it made for a very enjoyable movie.Don't let the trailer fool you, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, and it's a true shame that it hasn't made more money in the box office.

"High Score. (Yeah, I had to)","I don't even know where to begin raving about this movie. Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is one of the best movies of 2010. Here's why.I went into this movie knowing nothing about it except from seeing trailers and short clips. I hadn't read the comics or anything. Needless to say, I've now gone and read through them and while some people say that this movie doesn't hold a candle to the comics, I'm going to have to disagree. Unlike the Harry Potter films which are more of a companion to the novels than stand-alone films, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World can be viewed with no prior knowledge and still be enjoyed immensely. While certain plot points are skimmed over or cut completely, it doesn't detract from the final product.Scott Pilgrim is a love story. With fights. Edgar Wright described it as a musical, but instead of breaking into song, the characters break into fights. That's a pretty good description in my opinion. To be with the girl of his dreams, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) must fight - no, defeat - Ramona Flowers' (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) 7 evil exes. What follows is a film filled with life and energy and brilliance.I'm a huge Edgar Wright fan, he's one of my favourite directors (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). The cinematography in Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is so well done that you'll come out of the cinema buzzing. The editing of shots seamlessly really puts you in the zone. Even the rapid fight scenes that have new shots every few seconds never make you feel disoriented like in movies such as Transformers, where it's just 5 minutes of robots fighting each other in a blurry mess of steel.Maybe for a viewer who isn't 17 like me, the bright colours and video games references might not do much for them, but for someone who has grown up with video games and comic books, this movie was so good. And it wasn't just cheap shots either. There was no ""Oh look! Now we're putting in a sound clip from Zelda. Intertextuality for the win!"" No. It was done so subtly and reflected the film, the dream sequence particularly standing out for me, but I won't say any more for those who haven't seen it. The start of each fight with the 'VS' in between the characters and all the tiniest sound effects was enough to make this another great piece by Edgar Wright. The sheer number of The Legend of Zelda references alone was enough to win me over.I want to talk briefly about the soundtrack and score. The soundtrack is filled with some great songs that really fit the feel of the movie - the pure acoustic guitar and the 8 bit elements are pure brilliance. This is also reflected in the score, a more dramatic set of music but still retaining the retro video game feel that really pushes this film along.Michael Cera, who doesn't seem to age at all, gets a refreshing new role as Scott Pilgrim, and for once doesn't get to be 'that awkward guy' but rather 'that jerk who fights everyone for one girl'. He still retains his Cera-esque charm in the movie but it's great to see him become a bit of a badass. His supporting cast is fantastic as well, special credit goes to Kieran Culkin, Allison Pill and Chris Evans. Those three to me were absolutely hilarious, their comedic timing perfect. In fact, the whole cast does a flawless job of creating a great character list who connect with each other without stilted dialogue or awkward phrasing.This film is so energetic and fun and re-watchable. From every crunch of a fist against a skull to every perfectly delivered punchline, it remains one of the best films of 2010 that should really have done better at the box office considering the reception it's received.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
'An epic of epic epicness'  is another Edger epic experience.,"The familiar ingredients in this film are eminent. Love triangles, gay roommate, seven evil exes Whoa. Hold the phone, that doesn't sound like clichéd flop? That's because for the first time, in a very, very long time there is a romcom (with plenty of action, don't worry) which points its radar more to the boys than the girls – for once.Hapless Scott already has a girlfriend: Knives Chau, but then falls for eccentric haired Ramona Flowers (Cheerleading Death Proofer'). This mushy mess gets even uglier when the infamous boyfriends start to appear – but in a cracking arcade style that will easily make geeks heads explode, though that will unlikely add anymore colour to the screen. If that still isn't enough for you, the screen is burdened with oldie-style Batman film jargon's; everything from 'Whip' to 'Plonk' to the 'Dddddddddd' of a guitar note.Perfectionist Edgar has clearly exerted all his efforts into making a worthy third outing after Shaun of the Dead (his best) and Hot Fuzz (his newly instated third best after Pilgrim). True the script is barmy, but the wit is still pin-prick sharp and the momentous special effects give a gamers zest under the multitude of colour that isn't just Ramona's hair.Surprisingly not in 3D and surprisingly/disappointingly lacking a bare minimum of a cameo from Frost and Pegg, but there is so many quotable characters and realistic scenarios in an unrealistic world you'll soon get past it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
One my all time favorites,"I loved this movie! It's original, hilarious, and I love Michael Cera to death. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be just another quirky romance flick, but it proved to be so much more. The originality was stunning! It's not your average everyday movie where you can tell what's going to happen right off the bat. Cera's character faces challenges and personal demons just like you would in real life. Which brings me to my next point, the characters. All of them are far from cardboard cut-outs like you tend to see nowadays. The main character is perfect and has absolutely no flaws or debts. Scott is sort of dim-witted and frozen in time after his girlfriend dumps him, and ends up living across the street from the house he grew up in. Sad, right? It's those pathetic aspects of him that makes him into this believable, honest, even lovable character. SP vs. TW is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"You know when you go into a film with high expectations, and come out with those expectations passed more than you could ever imagine? Maybe you do, but it's quite possible that you don't. After all, this isn't exactly something that happens often, for anyone. This is especially true when it comes to a film adaption of something you're already a big fan of. These are generally, big, huge, massive, and whatever other synonyms there are for big disappointments for everyone. I didn't expect that Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the adaption of Bryan Lee O'Malley's popular graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim would be the same; in fact after what I had heard, I was almost certain it was going to be a great film. Maybe not as great as its source material, but I was pretty sure it wasn't going to suck. However, it did more than not suck. It pretty much blew me away.I watched it with a group of friends, and although only one of these friends was another fan of the comics, the atmosphere of the room as fictional band Sex Bob-omb begin to play and the opening credits began was a great one. Somehow, we all already knew we were in for a great ride. One friend commented ""even this is entertaining"" as the credits played in front of strange and colourful effects, and he was right. We were introduced to Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, and although I was always sceptical of this choice in casting, it wasn't long before I was happy with it. He didn't remind me of the Scott I knew from the comics, and this didn't change as the film continued; however, the Scott that he portrayed was quick to grow on me. It's most likely due to the fact that I already knew of Cera before watching his portrayal of Pilgrim that I saw him the way that I did, but this way that I saw him didn't take anything away from the film. The 'Michael Cera Scott' was funny, endearing, immature - everything that made the original character, he was just a different version of this character. Soon enough this version was making me laugh just as much as the original, and just like with the comics, I actually cared about the fate of this immature, 22 year old Canadian slacker.Cera was not the only one who gave a good performance here, not by a long shot. All of the funny and likable characters from the comics that were represented were represented well, definitely important in a story far more character than story-driven. Mary Elizabeth Winstead deserves huge props for her performance as Ramona Flowers. Although Ramona was never one of my favourite characters, not only did Winstead almost seem to look just like the original character (not sure how this works with such a cartoony source material, but it does), but this combined with her performance made me feel like I was watching the character I'd come to know in the comics. It was uncanny. Everyone else gave entertaining and funny performances that really brought a smile to my face. In summary: the cast rocked.What else rocked? The special effects rocked. The fight scenes were exciting, funny (video game and comic references errywhere), and packed with original effects. If they wanted everyone watching to stop caring that none of what was going on on-screen made sense, then they sure did a good job of this with both fun and mesmerising action scenes. Having listened to the soundtrack before seeing the film, I was wondering how they'd incorporate all those songs well, but I didn't really have to worry about that either. They did.I'm not sure if this would have been more or less fun for someone who didn't already know and love the comics, but as a fan, I can safely say the film-makers basically did a perfect job of incorporating both elements from the source material and new material to create a funny and consistently enjoyable experience. The quick cuts where Scott is getting ready to go out and fight the enemy, ending with the tying of his shoelaces, is simply one example of a hilarious element unique to the film, showing the film-maker's abilities to make the most of the film medium. They certainly stay true to the comics, but at the same time the jokes and events unique to the film only add to the experience.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not have the superb plot twists of some of my other favourite films such as Fight Club and The Prestige; it may not have the emotional impact of others like American History X and Atonement, however it doesn't have to have these elements. It is like no other film you will ever see, and it's exactly the way it should be, just the way it is. It is for these reasons and all of those listed above that it has become an instant favourite, and one of not many films that I would give a wholehearted 10/10 rating to. If you don't make it a priority to check this out, I personally promise to punch your life. In the face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Edgar Wright's Magnum Opus,"Scott Pilgrim is without a doubt one of my all time favourite films.Edgar Wright truly showcases his directorial ability through his use of transitions which guides the audience through its scenes and adds such a visual flair to the whole projects and at times even adding to its characters and furthering its comedy.The writing is equally as masterful. The movie is super meta and clever in its approach to humour giving the film so much charm, watchablility and giving a couple good laughs.The pacing of the film is also perfect, the combination of Wright's transitions and writing allows for such a fast paced film that keeps engagement throughout its entire run time and once again adding tons to its rewatchability.This is without a doubt Edgar Wright's most underrated movie, it's truly a shame that its initial reception was underwhelming but I'm glad people are finally realising what a great film this is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"Wait for the DVD, it'll be even better!","I hear that Wright is going to digitally replace Cera with Jar Jar binks in every scene. Early preview have shown a 90% reduction in unfocused feelings of rage and disgust among males in the 15-54 age brackets, and a 15% increase in arousal among females 18-34.If you can though, hold out for the BluRay, which will feature a scene where Cera is fed feet first into a wood chipper, slowly. Reportedly, his expression doesn't alter at all during the whole scene, and all that comes out is... wood chips.So, no, not a fan. Wright does all his usual jump-cut trickery, and finally with a budget to match his vision. Normally that would give a film a score close to fifty out of ten. Unfortunately, compressing the already trite source material down to under 2 hours knocks off a couple of points, and then Michael Cera is a solid 300 point ding.Scott - and there's a slacker hipster emo douche name right off the bat - is a slacker hipster emo douche, let's be clear on that. Note carefully that the Pilgrim fans denying that are all slackers, hipsters, emos and/or douches. So there's your market, right there.Since he's that particular sort of 22 year old just-getting-creepy slacker hipster emo douche who nails hot high school girls, that takes high school slacker hipster emo douches out of the picture. God damn 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches, stealing our girls.And since slacker hipster emo douche over 22 can't nail high school girls without getting 10 to 15 in Federal, that's another slice out of the potential market.So, this is a film for 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches. The kind of 22 year old slacker hipster emo douche who play 25 year old 8-bit games. In short, this is a film that will actually have to ""find"" its target audience by growing them in a vat. Should have spent some of the $120 million production and marketing budget on that, Universal.In all seriousness, there are only two things that you need to know about Scott Pilgrim: one, Michael Cera gets punched in the face. But two, he doesn't get punched enough. The end. Of Cera's career, hopefully, but sadly maybe of Wright's too. It really is a bitter-sweet story.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

HK Neo Reviews: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"To be frank, a bad filmI am not entirely sure, why people liked this film? Maybe, I am just stupid and did not get it. That is probably the case. However, I just do not see any point of liking it. The reason I endured the film till the end is partly by the somewhat enjoyable cast and some fast moving story telling. Still, I do not see the point of the fights and most likely than not, I must have missed something. Michael Cera is making a career of roles like these and is fast becoming a cliché. While the whole cast of actors are enjoyable to watch, I just do not seem to be able to get into the film and have fun. Is it just me?All in all, Scott Pilgrim is at its core a comic book film. Not that I read the comics, which probably answers my question as to why I did not like or get it. However, it must be said that some use of computer games effects are fun to watch. Still, a good gimmick or two does not justify me wasting a good 90 minutes. With all the rave and good reviews churning out all over the net, I even contemplated watching it in the cinemas. Now after the DVD venture, I am more than happy to declare that I didn't. Basically Scott Pilgrim does nothing for me and whether I get it or not is no longer an issue. The fact is I do not want to know(Neo 2010)I rate it 3/10www.thehkneo.com",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
I can't believe this movie exists..,"This movie is like a crazy dream I've been having since I first discovered video games. I watched it before I went to sleep last night and it triggered something in my mind.. I woke up this morning after dreaming about Nintendo characters in a fist fight with Disney characters. It was oddly satisfying to see Donkey Kong beating the living #%&! out of the evil stepmother from Cinderella. Of course my dream had to be interrupted when my phone rang ( Thanks again mum ).. And right before Pikachu was up against Piglet.. I REALLY WANTED TO SEE THAT!!I had little to no expectations but it left me hungry for a sequel.
You won't find anything quite like this. Very unique movie indeed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Edgar Wright at his finest,A re-watchable piece of art. Takes a weak premise and turns it into a delightfully fun ride with fast paced humor.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Acquired Taste,"I absolutely adore this movie but it is to an acquired taste. I guess Micheal Cera, slacker culture and pop/geek culture references can be too much for people. I find Cera an excellent actor but a lot of people don't like the geek hipster character he always plays but GET OVER IT! for this gem of a film. It also is ridiculous in some scenes when crazy fantasy duels occur but it fits in perfectly if you appreciate the comic-book setting. The inbetweener going for the hot girl is most definitely overused in movies but this film makes a overused cliché enjoyable, especially when you stick in 7 evil exes. This film is really unique and will live in my blu-ray collection forever. For this film you either need to be a geek, a college student, a loner or able to take the jokes. This is immortalized in my top 5 for being a film you can watch over and over again. No seriously, three times in a week.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
The best comic adaption yet,"This movie perfectly summed up the comic book and incorporated so many details and things that enchanced this movie. Completely kickass, fun and exciting. Highly recommened if you love video games, comics and cool/different movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
What a let down...,"This much anticipated flick was definitely not all it was cracked up to be. After hearing rave reviews from indie rockers and Scott Pilgrim graphic novel fans, I thought I was going to see one seriously awesome film. I was wrong. The acting was far below par, although kept along the lines of Michael Cera's awkward underdog preferred character. The supposedly comedic lines were delivered poorly, falling flatly amidst the silent audience; I'll admit it had its small moments, however. Some were even audible ""ha"" worthy. Those moments were far and few between. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone out of their teens that isn't heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) submerged into indie culture or does not have a tolerance for completely nonsensical films. It was truly ridiculous, with a bland plot line and bad acting. I wouldn't waste my time watching it for a second time, or spending any money on related products, such as the novels themselves. If they're anything like what the movie was, I am so not interested.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
It's a geekgasm.,"Need a director to characterise a video game, comic book and action movie in one medium? Edgar Wright's your man. You don't need to be a nerd in order to enjoy Scott Pilgrim's adventure. Just a childhood fashioned with intricacy and a longing for 'that girl'. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's starts how it intends to go on, its opening credits are loud and bright, and there's more to extract from it too. It plays on our geeky side whilst gaining new audiences. Sounds from Zelda: A Link to the Past are sly but obvious to some, 'SMACKS!' and 'THWONKS!' make a show like we're watching the original Batman, as do homages to Japanese Manga, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and all sorts of fictional clientèle. But is it all real for Scott? Michael Cera's lovable rogue blossoms when he meets Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and immediately falls for her. Is she real or fantasy? Either way, Scott must defeat her 7 evil exes in order to gain her love. Each new ex brings a new style of play. It's consistently stunning and breathtaking, and non of it makes any sense. The best thing to do with SPvsTW is to go along with it. Cera is a relatable frontman, worrying about how his hair looks and seeing his ex-girlfriend. Strong support comes from Scott's nosy sister Kendrick, his gay best-friend Aces (Culkin), his band mates, and all the exes, especially Chris Evans' movie star (who cracks his neck in time with Universal's theme tune) and Jason Schwartman. Go with the flow. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and it doesn't need to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Visual video game experience is great!,"Movies turned video games have a tendency to suck a lot more than they should, though many of them do have great potential to be turned in video games. Video games turned into movies have a tendency to suck as well, but in a good way. I have no idea why, but more often than not, a movie adaptation of a video game manages to entertain me. As a result, I enjoyed Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time (though not being a great film) and Doom (I rated Doom a 9.0 back when I was a snotty little 12 year-old brat, but even today Doom can still manage to entertain me). When I first saw a trailer for this before the excellent Toy Story 3 this summer, the first thing I said to myself was ''Damn this is gonna suck'', and even when the first reviews, who were mainly over positive, came out, I still wasn't interested in viewing this film. But having rented this film just a few hours ago, and in fact just a few minutes after the viewing, I thought I might just write a review for it.I've never read a Scott Pilgrim comic before, so I can't exactly say how faithful the film is to the comic books. But from what I saw in the movie, the story was great. We've all seen this story before, of an ordinary guy who is in love with a girl, but who must stand up to her boyfriend (usually two or three times the main character's size) in order to win her heart. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World makes our hero, an everyday normal guy (played by Cera, an actor I like very much), fall in love with crazy, colourful-haired Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But to gain her love, he must defeat her ''Seven evil x's'' (yes you read right. Not ex-boyfriends, just X's).Straight on you can say that the cast is perfect for this kind of film. It's really hard to see anybody else than Micheal Cera fill the shoes of Scott Pilgrim. He gives one of his most dynamic performances up to date, and he is definitely one of the good points of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is an actress I did not know very well (besides her supporting role in ''Live Free or Die Hard''), but she also portrayed Ramona quite beautifully. In fact all the actors in this film play their roles to the maximum without ever over acting, they just always seem to have the right amount of character in their roles.This is a film that will probably appeal mostly to teenage boys (like me) and their parents, who grew up during the NES generation. Back when the consoles only had a two-dimensional Mario character who would jump once in a while to get a penny, or stomp an evil mushroom. Being 14 years old (soon going on 15 :D), I am a person who, before buying his first console at the age of 9 (a Nintendo Gamecube), played with his dad's old NES. Even today, when I'm not on X-Box Live playing Madden, Call of Duty, NHL or a variety of other titles, I do plug out this old NES and, believe it or not, I do have a lot of fun with it. Therefore, those who have already experienced the NES will be delighted by the amount of references to old consoles this film makes. Whether the main character beats up bad guys and makes money out of it, or the opening Universal logo shown in 2-D, this film makes the most of gaming references.Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) also takes comic-book adaptation to a whole other level. This film has comic book adaptation written all over it, but that's mostly due to the references it makes to comic books when it is not referencing video games. The typical ''BAM!'' shown when the character hits a baddie. The visual effects were super, and though I'm not really a geek, I do have to say that Mary Elizabeth Winstead with her purple/blue/green hair was hot. Though some of the gags fell flat on a few occasions, most of them brought smiles, chuckles and laughs to me and my 10 year old sister. The visual effects were super. Definitely going to buy this one, and while this might be a real turn down for some, geeks and parents who experienced NES games and read many comic books during their youth should have a great time watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
"Cool, funny, geeky, madcap, wacky comic book adaptation that gets it nearly all Wright.","While Kick-Ass was busy gobbling up the lion's share of the attention and Daily Mail outrage, there was another genre-bending alt-superhero comedy mash-up last summer that rather slid under the radar, which is a great shame as, while it may not be as in-your-face outrageous, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a more engaging, funny and sprightly movie that mysteriously failed to storm the summer box office in the face of bigger, badder, swearier competition.A geek's paradise, Scott Pilgrim is chock full of gamer references, 8- bit sound-bites, and teen-rocking wannabee heroics, however what makes it more than the sum if its slacker culture nods and winks is a genuine warmth and affection for its inhabitants and their world. Brit helmer Edgar Wright, who showed he knows a thing or two about game-obsessed overgrown boys in Sean Of The Dead, tackles his first transatlantic mega-budget project with a breezy lightness; blending together bitter- sweet moments of awkward teen romance, and heart embiggening scenes of rock & roll camaraderie along with the madcap fights, and surreal flights of fancy.The young cast, headed by eternal dweeb plus ultra Michael Cera, are largely excellent, with quirky but likable supporting roles given the same care and attention as our eponymous hero. As a teen ensemble comedy it recalls the films of John Hughes, such is the ease with which it takes its outlandishly fantastical premise and grounds it with deft, easygoing character work.On the minor negative side, the film is rather undisciplined, being about twenty minutes longer than needed, with an occasional repetitious tendency brought on by its own multi-life, game-level structure, and somewhat lacks a solid dramatic shape as a result. But with so many charming, engaging characters and a sharp, witty script overflowing with quotable banter and inventive non-sequitur moments, the movie carries its excess baggage with a light touch and a giddy energy that is hard to resist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
Visually striking and fun to boot,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a stylistic smorgasbord that draws inspiration from a few key genres and pop culture elements, most specifically video games and music. I have heard it described in one corner as parody, but that I would say is incorrect. It is more a love letter to its influences, albeit with a comic bent, for certain. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that will play well to a certain segment of the population, and, unfortunately, at the box office it seemed that segment was smaller than many wished.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is based off a series of comics written by Brian Lee O'Malley. I am unfamiliar with the source material, so I can't comment on the faithfulness to them. The centerpiece is young Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), who is playing in a band named Sex Bob-Omb and has recently started dating a younger girl named Knives Chou (Ellen Wong). Into Scott's life falls Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a girl with constantly shifting hair color (she claims it changes every week and half) who Scott encounters in dreams before she turns out to be very corporeal and not just a figment of Scott's imagining. Scott, smitten, begins a relationship with her, but quickly finds that Ramona has some significant baggage: a group of 7 evil exes (don't just say ex- boyfriends, by the way) who have joined forces to fight against Scott in an attempt to reclaim Ramona for themselves. Scott, while not enamored of the concept, does his best to step up to plate as he wants to keep Ramona to himself.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World lives in a very fantasy reality that closely resembles our own. At first, it just looks like an everyday city with drama that most of us can relate to. It doesn't take long before we realize that things are not exactly as they are in our world. Dreams turn into reality, and then evil exes swoop out of the sky and challenge Scott to a duel, involving lots of martial arts fighting, flying, and comic book style expressions of action (the words POW and BANG float into view when someone fights or something crashes, for instance) and as Scott faces off with his opponents, a visual score tally appears, complete with video game sounds. So, if realism is what you seek, then it would be best to pass on Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. If, however, you enjoy video games and comic books, then Scott Pilgrim might be your speed.Director and co-writer Edgar Wright, who previously brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek with Scott Pilgrim. It is obviously not designed to take seriously, but it also wouldn't be fair to classify it an out and out comedy. It has its share of laughs, to be sure, but also is awash in visually striking, well choreographed fight sequences that rival such films as The Matrix in their energy and style. Its look is also heavily stylized, filled with obvious references to comic books without going to same degree as Ang Lee did with his take on the Hulk, which featured panels around the scenes in many cases.What makes Scott Pilgrim even more rewarding is that, for the most part, we identify and are taken in with its lead characters. Scott is a basically nice guy who seems a bit on the nerdy side, yet isn't without his flaws. Ramona seems a bit more jaded by life, and meeting Scott thaws her a bit from her rather troubled life up to this point. The dialogue between the two is lively and Cera and Winstead have an easy chemistry that works well.Wright has managed to fill many of the supporting roles, especially some of the evil exes, with names that are not superstars, but recognizable players that all offer up amusing turns in their various roles. Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and Jason Schwartzman all are having fun with their roles, and there is also a degree of satire in each character in regards to their chosen career and lifestyle (actor, vegan musician, and indie rock promoter).Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that didn't find its audience in the theater, but on video, it would not surprise me, especially considering who the film is targeted at, that it would eventually develop a cult following. Again, while I don't think Scott Pilgrim is everyone's cup of tea, if you have an affinity for what Scott Pilgrim draws from, and an ability to suspend disbelief, then I would say it is more than worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Scott Pilgrim vs My Lamp,"Would be more entertaining. I've been reading the other reviews on here and I just can't understand for the life of me how this movie ranks at almost an 8/10. Yes, I realize people view graphic novels as capable delivery devices for quality literature. That doesn't warrant a 2 hour plot that jerks to each cutscene like some guy tripping on acid, waits to deliver any sort of message till the last half hour, then flip flops back and forth about 5 times right at the very end trying to appease everyone in the audience. Combine that with preteen concepts and daydreams of love & fighting and this whole thing was like The Wonder Years in a video game played by someone with severe ADD. This is by far not the masterpiece people made it out to be.I won't lie, there were some funny bits just from the sheer nature of having the characters say random things for the entire 2 hours but there was nothing that even came close to the applause this movie has received. Originally, I wasn't going to watch this at all based on the trailer but I kept hearing good things so I gave it a shot.Bottom lineThe Good: Funny bits, decent fight choreography, interesting cinematography choices integrating the comic book/video game world with reality, hot Asian chickThe Bad: Extremely immature love story, random main character, laughable plot, terrible scene transition4/10, I recommend not seeing it to begin with but if you do make sure you do so with someone who gave this film an 8 so you can ask them to point out exactly what they were thinking",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

I'm the Bearded Movie Guy and I'm here to write a review for you to get happy and stuff.,"Scott Pilgrim VS The World is an incredibly quirky film that you either love or don't really understand. I for one thought it was awesome. It was funny, had a great cast, kicking soundtrack, was about a bass player for once, ( low end represent!) and was set in my home town, Toronto, which has so many great places to film, it was nice to see it get some movie love. Scott Pilgrim is original, directed perfectly from Edgar Wright and Michael Cera's best movie. All in all this is really cool film, and the comic and video game aspect made it even cooler, plus they have Thomas Jane as a member of the Vegan Police, which made me laugh and that alone makes it worth seeing.

"There is nothing like it - pure camp, pure entertainment","SCOTT PILGRIM vs. THE WORLD (2010)Sorry haters, this cheese-banger still holds its ground. It was my first time revisiting it since its theatrical release in 2010. It was a molly recovery day and felt like the vibe. Is it cheesy as all hell? Yes, on purpose - it does camp correctly, and stays committed. Are there things about it that are ""creepy"" now? Yes. Are teenage-to-college-age boys creepy? Yes. Therefore, it is made honestly & sincerely.The cast is pure fire. When this came out, I didn't know who half of these people were - now they're all legends (like Aubrey Plaza, Brie Larson, etc). Larson is immensely alluring in this - never seen her like this before. Her voice makes me melt. Cera is peak Cera - no one else could have done this like him. And, of course, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is perfect (as Ramona Flowers) - a lot of people still don't know her by name, but they should. She really turned up and delivered the performance of her career as the lead in 21 Cloverfield Ln - she was also the only thing I liked about Birds of Prey recently.Of course, the greatest thing about this movie is the over-the-top visuals which never stop being hyper-stimulating, the absurdism of the concepts, and the willingness to be as nerdy as possible. Due to its strange blend of things, Scott Pilgrim still manages to be a fully singular experience which is utterly entertaining even at a nearly 2-hour runtime.

Good Fun,"If you are thinking about viewing this film, imagine if Richard and Danny Elfman's expressionistic film ""Forbidden Zone"" (1980) was effectively blended with ""Napoleon Dynamite""(2003), ""Malice In Wonderland"" (2009), and ""Sky High"" (2005). If you liked any or all of those three films you should enjoy ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"". American audiences have historically been highly resistant to expressionism and it is interesting how that style is now finding an audience in the gamer and comic book crowds, apparently computer generated special effects have effectively kicked down the barriers that have long kept us trapped in the realism style.I came to this film as a fan of Alison Pill and was not disappointed, she appears to be having a lot of fun playing a variation of Mary Stuart Masterson's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (1987) character; although Alison gets to deadpan much funnier lines.And Mary Elizabeth Winstead should get some credit for putting herself out there in some unconventional stuff like this and Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" (2007). It is rare for an actress to take these kind of chances but it is a good way to avoid type casting. Ramona Flowers is the best ever ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"" - literally appearing in Scott's dream at one point.The huge cast helps explain the $60Million budget but tends to clutter the film and probably in part accounts for its poor box office showing. Gamers are obviously its target audience and it had trouble bridging its way to other viewer segments.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

Wright's best,"This is, so far, probably the best Edgar Wright's movie. However, I still have to look at his debut ""A Fistful of Fingers"", but I doubt it can even be compared with this.

He has to find the strength to break up with the kid and defeat the seven exes of his new girl. Instead of boring or pathetic love drama, this film Scott's overcoming his own insecurity and girl's emotional luggage displays in the form of fights in the style of ""Mortal Combat"". Whole movie was made in a combination of video game and comic-book style. Acting and music are good, and the camera, direction and editing will make your head spin. In this action romantic comedy, Wright once again shows his skill and genius.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
You absolutely need to be a certain person to enjoy this film...,"I was very much looking forward to ""Scott Pilgrim"". It's set in my hometown, it stars Canadian actor Michael Cera, it was directed by the brilliant Edgar Wright who has made films that I absolutely adore like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", and my college friends loved the comic book series.But thirty minutes into it, it dawned on me that I just wasn't the demographic this movie was targeting. I'm in my late 20s, and this movie seems definitely geared toward people in their late teens to early 20s, as well as people of all ages who can't focus.The storyline is not so much a storyline but a setup for the awesome special effects that pay homage to retro video games, Japanese animation and comic books. Scott Pilgrim, a bassist in his early 20s, meets a girl with wacky-colored hair who he falls head over heels for, but has to fight off her seven exes one after another before he can be with her. Let it be known that the special effects are VERY good and you'll see amusing sound and visual effects peppered throughout the entire movie that you'll be able to relate to if you've been even slightly interested in the things the film pays homage to. The film may not be much for your brain, but it definitely is a treat for your eyes.But that might be the only thing that holds it up. I felt myself coming out of the movie several times due to the sloppy screenplay. Similarly, the characters were all cardboard cutouts that I didn't care about. Even if characters are one-dimensional, they can still be endearing. Here, not so much. Most of them randomly appear to throw out some quip for its own sake without adding anything to the film, and then vanish just as inexplicably as when they appeared. This in itself isn't a problem, but this device just keeps happening way after it's stopped being interesting.I've never read the original comic, so something tells me my gripes with the film have everything to do with the fact that the source material just isn't that good. After seeing the film, I really can't imagine it being worth reading, since my main problem with the film was a lack of a story I could really grab onto. And really, unless you're a film student, isn't that what movies are for?If you're under 25, chances are good that you'll enjoy this film, because I can definitely see why it'd be fun to watch some random battles with lots of sfx that hark back to Super Mario and Street Fighter days. But if that's all there is to it, then I'll just play the video games! It just felt so long for lacking so much substance. Lots of style, though, so kudos to that. An extra point for being set in Canada, too, but a glossy dud is still a dud.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"

"A big funny video game fight, done in right way.","I've always wondered that if I should make a movie, how should it be? Well, Edgar Wright gave me the answer. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a perfect action comedy, done in absolutely right way. This is one of the funniest and most edited movies I've seen in quite a while. I love this movie.When I first watched the movie, I thought it was okay. One year later, I actually understood what movie this is. It's not that I didn't like the movie, I just didn't feel like ""This is awesome!!!"". Later that same year, I wondered what movie I would make if I should make a movie. So I listened to some heavy rock music and starting writing ideas. And in the end, the only idea I had, was the whole plot of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. So I thought ""I should rewatch this movie in case it's better the second time"", and so I rewatched it, and I sure as hell said to myself ""Wow, this is much better the second time"". This was the kind of movie I dreamt of making. A movie with stunning visual effects in every single picture. It's just freaking perfect, man!I love everything with this movie. How's it made, everyone who's in it, and the plot iself. This is a 100% original movie from Edgar Wright, who also made 4 of my other favorite movies (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End & Baby Driver). He always makes his movies different from other directors.Now, let's talk about the casting. Cause this is one of the most perfect castings I've ever seen. This is almost a superhero reunion. We've got Captain America, Captain Marvel, Superman, and that chick from Birds Of Prey. Other actors includes Kieran Culkin (Home Alone), Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Aubrey Plaza (Parks And Recreation), and Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore). But the best and funniest character and actor casted, is Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim. He's playing the main character in this movie without flaws, just so amazingly perfect. You know he's funny if you have watched Superbad, Juno or Arrested Development. But Scott Pilgrim is arguably his best performance.I really recommend to check out this movie. It is a modern cult classic and comedic gold. It is one of the best, funniest, most entertaining, impressive and most visual movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Fantasy"
