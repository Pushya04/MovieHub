Beautifully Twisted,"Two years before Hitchcock's legendary horror movie ""Psycho"" (1960) hit the theaters, our Alfred stunned audiences with another masterpiece. Perhaps not as dark, cruel and shoking as ""Psycho"" (1960) or ""The Birds"" (1963), ""Vertigo"" (1958) still manages to be called a timeless classic.First of all, Scottie's condition allowed the use of an entirely new camera technique. ""The Dolly Zoom"" is one of cinematography's most impressive camera tricks. Years before Steven Spielberg used it in ""Jaws"" (1975), Irmin Roberts was the first cameraman to ever use this technique, in a Hitchcock film.This movie tells the story of Scottie, a retired cop who's asked to investigate the case of his friend's wife, which seems to be possesed by the spirit of a dead young woman who committed suicide.As the chilling story goes on, several moments of suspense accompanied by chilling musical scores are happening. If you're not a fan of it, you can still enjoy the superb settings throughout the movie, and as well the beautifuly filmed shots. These elements alone are a pure work of art in my opinion.Because it's a 50's film, you will encounter extravagant dialogue between the characters, that still manages to look natural. It's not over the top forced as you may see in other films of the era.Toward the end of the movie, I appreciated the interesting depiction of madness that Alfred creates throughout dreams and illusions that our leading man deals with.
The beautiful lighting used in the last half an hour of the movie is also outstanding enough to be mentioned.
And, without spoiling anything, I'd like to mention how from my perspective, the leading man portrayed throughout the movie as a tragic hero, becomes an antagonist.Definetly an unpredictable and stylish classic you don't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Creepy and engaging.,"It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with ""Vertigo"" is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.The film is the story of a somewhat creepy ex-cop (James Stewart). When the film begins, he's emotionally scarred in an accident-an accident that leaves him with a HUGE case of psychologically-based vertigo. He decides to quit the job and is soon approached by an old friend--who wants to hire him to follow his emotionally disturbed wife. What happens next is very weird--and later becomes really creepy. I could say A LOT more but think it's best you just see the film--it has quite a few twists and turns that are bound to catch you by surprise.Overall, a wonderfully original film. The only deficit, for some, is that although Stewart was a wonderful actor, he was too old for this role. Still, I could look past this and enjoyed it immensely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Classic is a Classic,"There are no accidents here. Next year, in a few weeks, Vertigo will be 60 years old and it will celebrate it on top of the list of The Greatest Films Ever Made overtaking Citizen Kane and many other masterpieces. Why? Maybe when a filmmaker of Hitchcock's greatness taps into his own unconscious and reveals himself. By now we know enough about Hitchcock the man to know he was obsessed in finding that woman who'll look and behave just the way he wants and once he find them, they are destroyed to then embark on a quest to replace or duplicate her. Vera Miles was suppose to be the object of James Stewart's obsession and she opted for motherhood instead. Kim Novak replaced her and her coldness and detachment worked beautifully here. Barbara Bel Geddes the real woman who loves him he doesn't even notice, his focus is in the impossible.The magic touch in Vertigo is truly Bernard Herrmann. Try to see Vertigo without the score. No, don't. This classic is a marriage of images and music. A thriller with an uncomfortable truth at its very center. A personal truth from its filmmaker. I don't know if Vertigo will still be the number 1 in the list a hundred years from now, I will never know but I suspect that it will always be among the top.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Standard Rave,"Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous ""blondes""), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.""To reveal more,"" as Leonard Maltin wrote, ""would be unthinkable.""While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Distinctive & Unforgettable Masterpiece,"One of the many things that made Hitchcock such a great director is that he did not just stick to the same formula time after time; all of his best movies have their own unique feel and characteristics.  ""Vertigo"" is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension.  While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.There are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.""Vertigo"" is a classic by any standard.  It's a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of the most surprising films I've seen.,"Scottie Ferguson is a police officer, retired because of fear of heights. His life changes when he accepts to watch a woman at the request of her husband, who suspects that his wife has been visited by a ghost. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has script Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, with the participation of James Stewart and Kim Novak.This film is considered by experts one of the best films ever made. I never understood why but, nevertheless, is one of Hitchcock's films that I most like to see. The script is very good, mixing love, obsession, loyalty, madness and mystery in an irresistible recipe that takes the seal of quality of one of the most brilliant masters of suspense in cinema. The ending is baffling. Technically impeccable, this film has an excellent picture, sound effects and a soundtrack where the emphasis is given to the opening theme that, in all fairness, became one of the most famous of Bernard Herrmann. The performance of the actors also deserves congratulations. Stewart shows why Hitchcock was so fond of working with him and Novak can perfectly be, at the same time, the damsel in distress and the femme fatale, who leads men to act without thinking.Essential for all Hitchcock fans, this film is a must-see for any lover of suspense and mystery. It's a film that can be seen by teenage audiences, despite having some more dramatic scenes, and probably will please the majority of audiences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
You're not lost. Mother's here.,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties...Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being.Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on.Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions.Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beyond Amazing,"Over the years, this film has been regarded as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Its been called the most personal, emotional, and complex of Hitchcock's films. I agree with all of these things except for one, this film IS Hitchcock's masterpiece work. All of the others pale in comparison to this. There are phenomenal performances here by Jimmy Stewart who plays the biggest anti-hero of his career and Kim Novak whose stunning beauty and exceptional personalities shine through this dark film. Barbara Bel Geddes provides great support as well. Everything about this film, the cinematography, the story, the depth, etc. leaves you mystified and transfixed on this dizzying, surreal artwork of a film. It truly is flawless. If you are a Hitchcock fan and haven't seen this you need to get up right now and buy, not rent, this as soon as possible!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A fine story that misses the mark,"A lowly 6/10? I know that will be seen as sacrilege by those that rate this to be Hitch's 10/10 masterpiece, but as many times as I see this film and as many times as I want to like it, I just cannot get overly enthused.The premise of the film is a very good one . . . Madeleine (Kim Novak), the wife of a wealthy businessman, is acting very strangely - apparently lost in a past woman's life, mentally troubled and disappearing at times. He asks his friend Scottie (James Stewart) to follow her and work out what she is up to. We follow Scottie following Madeleine, and are invited to work out what is going on in Madeleine's mind.Madeleine and Scottie's relationship develops (unconvincingly for me) until a key moment in the film that on first viewing might seem like the film's concluding scene. In fact, that dramatic moment is just an excellent twist and the beginning of 'part two' of the movie, a part that further explains who Madeleine is, whether Scottie can come to terms with his own issues and what was happening all along.So, a potentially fascinating psychological story based on deception, suspense and intrigue with a terrific plot twist, by one of the the world's greatest directors who's films I adore - what's not to love? Well, for me quite a bit.The early scenes where Scottie follows Madeleine are necessary to the story but really very dull. Slow is fine, but slow and boring isn't. Then there's Kim Novak playing Madeleine - some say she gives the performance of a lifetime, but I found her performance as dull as dishwater; the most memorable part of her performance was the astonishingly distracting false eyebrows. Finally, while the superior 'part two' of the film elevates the movie considerably, the actual ending - as in the last minute or so of the film - just seems too ridiculous.I respect and understand entirely those who see this as Hitch's psychological masterpiece, and I wish I could join them and get the same pleasure from the film. Sadly there are just too many flat spots, over dramatisations and unbelievable characters for me to get past. At least Hitch has left us with an interesting debate.Good, not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Classic Hitchcock and Stewart,"An interesting psychological piece that richly displays Hitchcock's talents.  It is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence.  Hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958, where I'm sure a work like this, that seems tame by today's standards, appeared bizarre and risqué.  Also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak.James Stewart and Kim Novak are appealing on numerous levels, the former mainly because he doesn't wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to.This is not a film I especially like (I couldn't watch it again and again) but I respect for its strong filmmaking.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Mesmerizing.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this mesmerizing film that stars Jimmy Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired San Francisco policeman who is approached by old college friend Gavin Elster(played by Tom Helmore) who wants him to follow his wife Madeline(played by Kim Novak) who has been acting strangely. Scottie does follow her, and becomes obsessed by her beauty and behavior, eventually falling in love with her, with devastating consequences. Though that is only the start of the mystery... Barbara Bel Geddes costars as Scottie's friend Midge, still in love with him, despite jilting him years before. Superbly directed and acted film has an ingenious story and stunning imagery, making this an unforgettable romantic mystery, with a stunning ending...though if you have the DVD, watch the extra feature on the lost extended ending, which is fascinating, and changes the tone of the film as a result!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hypnotic,"The Cinema is often referred to as an Art form, although only a handful of films actually live up to that ideal.  most films, even great ones, are extremely forgettable to all but the most die hard movie buffs. Which is why Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is such a breath of fresh air.  Here is a subtle, suspensful, mezmerising tale told with the patience and sure handedness of a true artist.  At it's heart Vertigo is a tale of deception and obsession.  After the brilliantly exciting opening sequence (which has been ripped off countless times, like much of Al's catalogue) the movie slows down to a steady, almost frustrating pace.  It's main theme develops only gradually, allowing the viewer to soak in every tiny detail of character development. I fear, however, that this film may be too subtle and cerebral for most of today's action obsessed movie buffs, but for those viewers with a little bit of patience and just a drop of thoughtfulness, ""Vertigo"" will prove a very rewarding experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Surreal masterpiece,"Not very popular with critics or audiences when it first came out, probably not what they were expecting form the master director. Certainly a very different movie not in the usual Hitchcock formula. The movie probably needs more than one viewing. I can understand why some people don't like it much, but if you can get into the mood and atmosphere it's a surreal masterpiece. The movie is really about creating a surreal dreamlike world to enter. Set in San Francisco in 1958 it is like nothing before or since. Unforgettable and mesmerizing it is full of great locations, strange characters and stories. We go on a strange uneasy journey with Jimmy Stewart where there is no return and end up somewhere between sanity and insanity. Everything about this movie goes together to create another world which you feel like you have entered, the music, the 1950s grainy film, the dull colours, the incredibly shot locations, the changing light. It is certainly a strange movie hard to put into a box. It is from another time. Amazing. Like a dream... A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood. A Hollywood which doesn't exist anymore. There is just something about this movie, which you can't put your finger on. It's full of secrets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

This film takes repeated viewings to really appreciate it...,"... and perhaps that is why it bombed upon initial release.When Vertigo was first released in 1957, it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.It is unusual to see a director produce his best work after the age of 50, but that is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock did. Starting in 1948 with ""Rope"" and ending with ""The Birds"" in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. ""Vertigo"", in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever ""real"" opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart), but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Good but overrated.,"Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called.The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.,"Oscar ignored this fantastic film by Hitchcock starring James Stewart. It gave nomination for Art and Set decoration and Sound. Small acknowledgment of an outstanding film.James Stewart was outstanding as a detective that was duped by his ""friend (Tom Helmore)."" We were all led on an adventure that made absolutely no sense until we were shown the result. This film really had me going! Kim Novak was also excellent in her role as the wife. She was so good that I had no idea that she was anything more than object of Stewart's obsession. Hitchcock had me going her also.This was an excellent movie and should have had more recognition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I'm running in circles trying to like this film.,"Personal Rating: 7/10To cut to the chase, this movie didn't live up to my expectations. Coming off the back of 'Dial M for Murder' which I adored, I was excited to watch what critics argue to be the best film of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and I'm left feeling disappointed.Why? Why am I not madly in love with the thing the whole world has touted as a masterpiece? The answer lies in the movie's name and one of its many motifs. Vertigo and spirals. This movie gives the viewer a sense of vertigo, packing many many spirals into its 2hr+ runtime so that by the end... are you truly any further than you were at the beginning? Example: Scottie chases ""Madeline"" around town following her, he then receives a piece of information, deepening the plot, and it starts up the next day, following her around. She falls, gets rescued (one of the most talked-about scenes: sexual tension, desire, lust, giving in, disillusionment, the whole shebang) and the following happens again the next day, with yet another piece of information to deepen the plot. Scottie becomes infatuated with ""Madeline"" and we think little of it, just like his going to Ernies and driving down a row of trees but when all of that happens exactly again later in the film more information has been revealed, the stakes are higher. This whole film is a spiral tightening in on itself. I mean the action the movie ends on is the exact action that occurred during the ""climax"" (middle) of the film. Talk about running in circles.The fun thing about circles, is they're great to talk about, just read some of the reviews for this film, essays they really are. People project themselves onto this movie, some apply 21st-century values on this 1958 film, others attempt to see things from Hitchcock's perspective, everything. I'm not saying that's wrong, everyone's entitled to share how they interpret something! But I haven't found someone that just asks, were you satisfied at the end?Perhaps I'm daft, not a true cinema buff, but for a movie to become a personal favourite for me I have to love the story, not just question it.To conclude though, this film in all its other ways is spectacular. The score, beautiful. There's a point where 20 minutes pass with only a few words of dialogue, all you have is the score and it's magnificent. James Stewart and Kim Novak were incredible in their performances, and the cinematography, well, almost hurts how beautiful it is. Jaws eat your heart out, Hitchcock perfected the dolly zoom. And the use of colours (Green & Red), genius.There's no doubt in my mind I will watch this movie again. There are plenty of things done very well, it just is not an enjoyable movie as a whole for myself. Whether you agree or disagree, thanks for reading my review.One is a wanderer; Two together are always going somewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's most stunning achievement. A fascinating masterpiece which improves with each year and viewing.,"I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock's greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it's very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's once-overlooked masterpiece,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart, never better) is a retired detective with a severe fear of heights after a botched chase to capture a criminal. Due to his newly acquired acrophobia, he retires and wanders around the beautiful streets of San Francisco. Out of the blue, an old college friend Gavin Elster asks him to follow his wife Madeleine, as he believes that Madeleine may be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, drifting in and out of reality and into trance-like states of mind. So Scottie agrees to follow the mysterious blonde (Kim Novak) as Hitchock guides us throughout San Francisco and into his strange and dark mind. Little by little, Scottie begins to become infatuated with Madeleine, and after he saves her from suicide (she jumped into San Francisco Bay) and decides to help her, he falls madly in love with her. In finding pieces of the puzzle to Madeleine's mystery, their journey takes them to the San Juan Bautista where Madeleine meets her end by tumbling off the bell tower, presumably by suicide. Scottie tried to save his love but his fear of heights stopped him. For the next year Scottie falls into a deep depression, feeling guilty for his impotency to save his love. His depression is halted when he sees Judy Barton (Novak again). Judy isn't like Madeleine--she's plain, in touch with reality and even vulgar when compared. But her face looks so much like Madeleine. Scottie begins to court Judy first for herself but eventually he tries to mold her into the beauty he lost prematurely, unaware that Judy has a big secret up her sleeve.When it was first released, Vertigo didn't get good reviews and it didn't make money at the box office. People didn't understand the bizarre dream sequences that were so ahead of their time, they didn't feel sympathy for the characters (at the end, even Scottie is unlikable), and the BIG TWIST is given away in the middle of the movie instead of at the end, a la Psycho. Even I had my complaints about that last one, yet after a second viewing I realized that this movie wasn't even about what really happened to what really happened to Madeleine; it's about men's psychological--and sexual--desire for the perfect woman, even if she's out of touch with reality. This movie is considered Hitchcock's most personal film, as he could be domineering with his actresses, trying to mold them into his own dream. After the ""failure"" of Vertigo, Hitchcock never worked with Jimmy Stewart again, unfairly blaming him for not being able to draw a crowd on account of his age. Luckily for everyone, Vertigo has gotten better with age and is no longer forgotten. In the late 80s Vertigo started popping up on Top 10 Films of All Time lists, and today it's considered Hitchock's best film, and most definitely one of the best ever made.The biggest reason for Vertigo's late success is because it is Hitchcock's most analyzed film and because it works on a psychological level; The film points out that men would rather have an unavailable, beautiful woman who is out of touch with reality than a woman who understands her surroundings and is utterly available. This is pointed out twice, once with Midge, an ex-fiancée and good friend of Scottie and later with Judy, who tries to make Scottie love her for who she is and not because she reminds Scottie of Madeleine. The first hour is drawn out very slowly, and while it's not as fast-paced as other Hitchcock's films, he uses it wisely. He starts by first gaining--later testing--our sympathy for Scottie; when he's hanging for his dear life in the opening scene, we pray for him (even though we know that there would be no movie if Jimmy Stewart dies in the first 3 minutes). When he's chasing Madeleine up the bell tower, we hope that he can get there in time and kiss his lover. And when the romance turns dark in the second outing to the bell tower, you feel just as caught in the middle as Scottie does in that moment. Hitchcock blurred the lines between victim and villain, and he earns our creative respect for him.The key element to why Vertigo works so well in the end is because of the actors. It's practically impossible to think of anyone other than James Stewart, who embodied the everyman, and for that reason is so convincing in testing our sympathies. It's all in the minimalistic ways he does it, with the slightest crinkle in the forehead or the movement in the eyes doing evoking more emotion than most actors do screaming and crying. This is his best performance next to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. And Kim Novak is ravishing and haunting both as Madeleine and Judy, utterly convincing in both roles. With my respects to Grace Kelly, Novak just may be the most mysterious and convincing Hitchcock blonde to grace the screen. Their chemistry together, despite their age difference is explosive and natural.Buy--don't rent--this DVD and you'll find yourself falling for every detail of this brilliant film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"A thriller of undeniable complexity, and impeccably acted and directed-Hitchcock's masterpiece!","I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema. An unforgettable masterpiece, 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Among the very best.,"In Boileau-Narcejac's French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""= from among the Dead""),the revelation only comes in the last pages,but Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag long before the end. Boileau-Narcejac's novel is a pure detective story,but the Master wanted more:the movie already outdistances the book in a first part visually wonderful,with memorable scenes,wrapped in mystery ,such as the one with the sequoia,symbol of immortality or the one down by the sea,to rival with the best romantic movies of all time.In the second part,Hitchcock explains in the Truffaut's book,we know but Scottie( James Stewart) does not .And he tries to recreate a dead woman,to transform Judy into Madeleine.This folie à deux ends where the first tragedy occurred ,which gives the movie a strength that the book had not.Read it and you'll realize how its end ,speaking in terms of cinema,had to be modified for the screen.That's Hitchcock's genius.When Boileau/Narcejac learned that Hitchcock wanted to transfer ""Celle Qui N'Etait PLus "" (=les Diaboliques"" )to the screen,they immediately wrote ""D'Entre les Morts "" on the same pattern for Hitchcock to direct.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Favorite Hitchcock and likely one of the most challenging, harrowing great films ever","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies).Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images and dark scenes come into great view. Not one of the more outright 'fun' Hitchcock films, with the few chuckles plain comic relief, and maybe his best serious work. A++",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful,"Once you've seen ""Vertigo"" you can almost see the whole thing again in your head. Its haunting images stay with you. Whatever else you might say about ""Vertigo,"" (and there are those who don't like it), it's unquestionably a visually beautiful film. It formed my impressions of San Francisco, and when I finally visited that city, it all seemed so familiar. In fact, many of the locations remain unchanged after more than fifty years - Mission Dolores, The Brocklebank Apartments, The Legion of Honor, The Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point. You can even stay in the same Sutter Street hotel where ""Judy"" lived (The Empire Hotel is now the Hotel Vertigo). If I can find fault at all with this film, I point to James Stewart who, despite a great performance, looks too old for the part and his chemistry with Kim Novak is dubious (Much better in their other 1958 outing, ""Bell, Book and Candle""). When ""Vertigo"" failed at the box office on its initial release, Hitchcock is said to have blamed it on Stewart, and I tend to believe it. After four films together, he never used him again. Nevertheless, ""Vertigo"" entertains on many levels. I don't even mind the unexplained and illogical sequences (Madeleine waking up nude in Scottie's bed and neither one of them making an issue of it; her disappearance from The McKittrick Hotel). And I'm impressed by the downbeat and abrupt ending, which surely was unusual for a Hollywood film at that time. ""Vertigo"" is in a class by itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Most overrated movie Hitchcock has directed and produced,"There are many Hitchcock films that I really enjoyed watching but ""Vertigo"" is not one of them. Many parts of the plot are unnecessary or not clear at all:1. At the beginning of the film, was he really hanging from that rooftop? Was he saved? How was he saved? It seemed impossible that he was saved since he had a ""Vertigo"" and no help was no near. But somehow the movie continues without explaining how
he survived or who saved him.2. The character Midge Wood (ex-fiancée) gets introduced to the story. Midway through the film she leaves the film and we never hear from her again. What was the point of her being in the movie in the first place? Did Hitchcock really need this person to exist so that the protagonist can explain to the audience what being afraid from heights means?This list could be larger but I think I made my point clear. This movie contains lots of unnecessary elements and the pacing of the plot was too slow for my taste. I want to end this review though by praising the protagonist' acting. Strong performance from James Stewart!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I love Hitchcock but...,"Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold.James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond me—I struggled to stay awake.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Makes the Brain Spin,"Having experienced vertigo myself, the dizzying, confusing, frightening mind spinning, ""think you're going to die"" kind of feeling, I can empathize with the Jimmie Stewart protagonist.  Make him a hero who has enough hangups from trauma to last a lifetime.  Put into the plot a series of misrepresentations of fact and you have this movie.  I think what I like the most is that we have this man trying to put his life together, but he doesn't know what to do to make it work.  He also is deep in depression, caused by personal loss. Along comes Kim Novak, the carbon copy of his lost love.  He falls into a sick reconstruction of his past life, but the fear is still there and won't go away until he is able to confront his ghosts.  Once again, the Hitchcock hero fumbles his way along, trying to discover while being pursued.  There is that threat there all the time.  The cinematography is excellent.  The method used to show the feeling he gets when he looks down, is pure genius. The framing of scenes. The stairway in the tower. The scenes by the bay. Novak's ""coming out"" is really spooky, so captivating and yet unsettling. The true test of a movie, for me, is always going to be that there is something to see after several viewings.  Hitchcock's films, especially the really good ones, allow me a lifetime of rediscovery; I feel that directors like Hitchcock are a gift to humanity.  This film is one of the reasons I feel this way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Vertigo was the 19th. I'm not sure why it took me so long to get round to seeing one of the most lauded Hitchcock films but I think it was because it was so hyped and people said that it was edgy and artistic that I thought it was pretentious bullshit and didn't really fancy it.I went into the film thinking it was going to be good but that it was over-hyped and there was almost no way that it could live up to my expectations. I was mistaken. This film is a masterpiece and I absolutely loved it.Now, I'm not going to wax lyrical about the camera techniques or anything pretentious like that because that's just not what matters to me in a film. I rate films based on how captivating or enjoyable they are. I would give this one 10/10 on both. I have noticed that the reviews that ""hate"" this film complain about people who like it being pretentious and deluded but I noticed that they cannot offer a reason why the film itself is not good. They just criticise the fans of this film. That's where I reckon they are trying to be edge-lords and rebel against the acclaim this movie has received.I'm a firm believer in not judging a film by its fans. Perhaps the fans of this film are pretentious but that doesn't take away from this exceptional film itself.Some people who like with pretentiously wax lyrical about cinematic techniques and others will talk about the amazing plot, the dialogue, the tension and the fantastic performances.

A Masterpiece of Obsession,"While pursuing a criminal on the roofs of the buildings in San Francisco, Detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a severe trauma when his partner falls off the roof trying to save him. He suffers from acrophobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning: she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing.""Vertigo"" is a masterpiece of obsession by Alfred Hitchcock. The timeless complex story is perfect and full of suspense and psychological and sexual tensions. Kim Novak is extremely sexy and has an extraordinary performance in her double role and James Stewart is awesome as usual performing a charismatic character that becomes obsessed when he sees Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes performs an important support character that helps to develop James Stewart's character. The open conclusion is also excellent and the music score is also spectacular and gives a suspenseful touch of class to this film. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is walking in front of the entrance of the shipyard carrying what seems to be a musical instrument.

"Accomplished If Not ""Fun"" Hitchcock Drama","Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, ""Vertigo"" may be tough to warm up to on a first viewing. It's an enigmatic and extremely slow-moving film, and it feels personal in ways that many of Hitchcock's other, more playful movies don't. You get the sense that Hitch is working through his personal demons on screen -- the fetishes and obsessions that played such a major role in so many of his films leading up to ""Vertigo"" feel like characters in and of themselves here.James Stewart delivers a frightening performance as a man who plunges into a world of weird sexual obsession when a woman with whom he's formed a romantic attachment dies (or seems to). He finds another woman who looks amazingly like the first, and proceeds to force a complete physical makeover on her in an attempt to recreate his former love. Kim Novak plays the two women in her typical icy fashion; for once, her stilted, awkward acting works for a role and comes off as an attribute rather than a liability.In its new remastered life on DVD, ""Vertigo"" looks stunning. San Francisco and its surroundings are bathed in ethereal, dream-like lighting, and Hitchcock pays more attention to art direction and the use of color than he ever had previously. Also, there's that amazing swirling Bernard Herrmann score that haunts the film, and accompanies one of the most memorable opening credits sequences ever filmed.There are still a number of other Hitchcock films I would rather watch before ""Vertigo,"" and many others that I would qualify as much more fun, but I can't deny that this one certainly has an allure.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Karma, Deception, and Obsession.","Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo. An impressive tale about obsession.In honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday, I decided to re-watch Vertigo and reevaluate just how well it holds up upon repeated viewings. There's nothing quite like the shock of watching it for the first time, but I had a chance to dig my teeth into the legendary performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak while being dazzled by Hitchcock's meticulously crafted story.One of the most impressive aspects about Vertigo is that it's clearly framed as a story about someone with Vertigo dealing with a peculiar case, but really, it's about obsession, and a man digging just a little bit too deep into a case. A theme that Christopher Nolan seemed to take into his film, Memento, in 2000. Vastly different stories, but similar execution from the director's chair.An easy way to identify a film's tone is through the score, and Hitchcock always seemed to get the best out of the legend, Bernard Herrmann. His score here is both haunting and alluring. I love the way he balanced the score with the uncomfortable feeling we get as an audience watching Stewart's character obsess, along with the noir- ish love story that forms as well.Amidst Hitchcock's mind boggling story are a few darn good performances by Stewart and Novak. Stewart, typically known strictly in likable protagonist roles, finds himself in a more complex and even unlikable alley. There's certainly times where the lines between protagonist and antagonist are blurred, but Stewart does a great job at rounding out his character. Novak, on the other-hand, plays a more mysterious role but nonetheless just as significant. Aside from the characters in Psycho, Novak may have had the most difficult time portraying just who Hitchcock desired for this role. If there was ever a Hitchcock blonde who deserved a Best Actress Oscar, I think it was Novak.Overall, Vertigo holds up just as well as the first time I watched it, and perhaps even better in some aspects. There's a reason this film is at the top of so many greatest films of all time lists.+Hitchcock's colorful direction+Stewart and Novak were at the top of their game+Herrmann's score+Themes still hold up10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Love, love, love this movie!","Okay, so I love this movie just a little! But what's not to love! One Of Hitchcock's greatest movies in my opinion. There are so many good characters in this movie - but I almost think my favorite character is the city of San Francisco. Not really, it's Jimmy Stewart. BUT San Fran sure figures prominently in the movie. What a gorgeous city. Perhaps I'm a little partial because my husband & I spent our honeymoon there 20 years ago. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie as it is filmed beautifully. Also, there is some artistic twists like the green lights and haze in Novaks apartment.This movie is definitely a great plot twister the 1st time you see it. It of course loses some of the bang with subsequent viewings since you know the twist. However, subsequent viewings are still enjoyable as I always notice different tidbits and details I didn't catch before.I love Jimmy Stewart in his love-sick puppy, obsession role. I love the title theme music. It starts creating tension right off the bat, and keeps your pulse going throughout the movie, anticipating what is going to happen next.I just recently re-watched the movie (probably my 5-6th time) with my 14 year old daughter, who was seeing it for the first time. I had yet been able to convince her to watch any old, classic movies with me ( too old fashioned in her mind). But for whatever reason, she agreed this time. And what a great 1st classic movie for her to see. I was surprised but she not only stuck with it all the way to the end, but was actually somewhat riveted throughout the movie! What surprised me is she somewhat predicted the ending ahead of time. That kind of shocked me because I never saw it coming the first time I watched.I'm not sure why, but Midge's character creeps me out more with each viewing. Especially the painting scene - she seems like a stalker, obsessed lover. But Bel Geddes plays her beautifully.You definitely have to see this movie.

The plot is just too convoluted and unbelievable. Novak's Judy Barton portrayal is grotesque. But most of all, the pace of the film is much too slow, as if it was necessary to fill two hours of screen time, and frequently boring.

Dull and nonsensical!,"Just saw the ""restored"" version of ""Vertigo"" on video. Had never seen the movie before. First half was exceedingly dull as Jimmy the sleuth followed Kim on her aimless journeys. The pace and excitement picked up steam when Kim seemingly threw herself out of the missionary bell tower. But as the mystery unfolded, the plot and especially the ending scene where Kim falls again become so far fetched as to leave the viewer feeling like they had just experienced two HUGELY wasted hours. And Jimmy falling in love with Kim shortly after meeting her is both unethical and unbelievable. Afterall, he was hired by HER husband to follow her. And then he wastes no time making out with her and becoming obsessed with her after only a few short days. Totally UNREAL, especially for Jimmy who, as a star, is traditionally a thoroughly likable guy.The restoration effort turned out a beautiful product, full of color and clarity, and the movie serves as a wonderful historic insight into 1958 San Francisco, but other than that, this movie has to be one of Alfred's worst. Entertainment value is ZERO.OK...After reading some glowing reviews from other commentors, I just had to add a few more criticisms.Firstly, the scene where Jimmy falls off the step stool into Barb's arms is so MELODRAMATIC, namely Jimmy's facial expression, that it was laughable. Alfred should have seen how UNREAL and overdone Jimmy's expression was and changed it. I didn't buy it for a second.Secondly, though I like Jimmy Stewart, I found him unlikeable in this part. I cannot get past his UNETHICAL, UNPROFESSIONAL involvement with his friend's wife whom he has been PAID to follow. It's INEXCUSEABLE! And I'm a liberal minded person.Thirdly, Jimmy looked at least 25 years older than Kim. I find older men lusting after the young and beautiful to be both unsavory and undignified.Fourthly, Jimmy, though he's certainly old enough to be wise and experienced, was playing a stupid character who makes a lot of stupid mistakes. Kim, on the other hand, is practically a lifeless prop and a mere backdrop for Jimmy's inherent stupidity.Final assessment - There are no likable characters in this movie. The real Kim comes across as pathetic in her need to feel love at any cost and Jimmy is downright unlikeable. He's just dumb. Thus, no real sympathy is created for either character.My question becomes: HOW did any respectable and professional movie reviewer such as Ebert miss all this????",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Get Lost in It.,"Along with ""Psycho"", Hitchcock's best film that wraps itself around the viewer very fast and never does let go. San Francisco detective Jimmy Stewart is slowly going crazy due to a failed mission which did not work because of his intense fear of heights. This is all front-page news of course and Stewart is shamed about the whole event. But a ray of light shines as he gets a job to watch a man's wife (Kim Novak) who is supposedly having an affair with another man. Stewart believes this is his chance to put the past behind him, but sometimes the future is even darker. Stewart falls in love with Novak and the love turns into a dark and twisted obsession that becomes deeper and deeper as the film progresses. When tragedy strikes, that is the end. Right? Not quite. An amazing screenplay and arguably Hitchcock's greatest directing venture make the film solid and Stewart's stunning performance raises the whole project to a classic level. Somewhat ignored around the awards circuit in 1958, but ages beautifully as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Psychological masterpiece,"No Alfred Hitchcock film has been picked at, dissected, debated, and analyzed as much as ""Vertigo"". There's good reason: ""Vertigo"" has the most complex and surreal storyline of any of Hitch's classics. The commercials you may have seenfor ""Vertigo"", the trailers, or the plot summaries are completely misleading. This is not a love story. It's not even about James Stewart's fear of heights. It's about the dark, twisted side of human nature and the atrocities we're capable of when we allow ourselves to be driven by fear, greed, illusions, and obsession.John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired detective who's haunted by guilt over an accident that had an officer killed and left Scottie with a newly developed fear of heights. One day, Scottie receives an unexpected request by an old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to shadow Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). Elster believes that Madeleine is being possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, Carlotta Valdez, a woman who went insane and committed suicide. Ester fears that Madeleine will suffer the same fate. So Scottie agrees to follow the strange and stoic Madeleine, a coldly beautiful blonde who moves as if sleepwalking. When she jumps into San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and soon falls in love with her, and she with him. But as their relationship grows, Scottie's love turns into obsession, and it only escalates when it seems he is unable to protect Madeleine from Carlotta's vindictive spiritIf you are unfamiliar with what happens next, I will stop there. What happens next must take you by surprise. By 1958 Stewart had proved that he had range and a dark side in his acting, but never did he exemplify it more than in ""Vertigo"". His character goes on such a downward spiral that even after all that Scottie's been through, we're not so sure we want to root for him anymore. Kim Novak makes an inspired Hitchcock Blonde. With her stiff mannerisms, translucent skin, pale blonde hair and famous gray suit, she almost gives the impression of being encased in ice in the early outdoor scenes.One of ""Vertigo""'s biggest surprises is Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's close friend Midge. Bel Geddes (who died in August 2005 at the age of 82) is absolutely magnificent, bringing depth and refreshing warmth to a potentially thankless part. You really feel for Midge when Scottie, blinded by his infatuation with Madeleine, cruelly brushes their friendship aside and all but abandons Midge. On bad days I can't figure out what Scottie sees in frigid basket case Madeleine as opposed to warm and witty Midge.Minor quibble aside, ""Vertigo"" is an honest-to-God masterpiece, with its hypnotic opening credits by Saul Bass, sinister, mind bending Bernard Herrman score, dizzying suspense scenes, and bizarre love story.

"""You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.""","VERTIGO is an exciting and tense mystery melodrama. One capable detective from San Francisco was haunted by memories of a tragedy that occurred on a night chase for one criminal. He stars being afraid of heights after those events. Withdrawal from work is an obvious choice. He enjoys the company of a romantic painter, who is in platonic love with him. However, he accepts the detective work, trying to help an old friend, whose wife suffers from a mental disorder. He becomes an important link in the game of conspiracy and intrigue...The story is very complex, interesting, tense and anxious. A romantic adventure between cruel secrets and unfathomable mystery. Mr. Hitchcock has toyed with intrigue, identity and dreams in this film. Powerful psychological reviews permeate between dream and reality. The main protagonists are torn between deceit and obsession. Soundtrack is very important and well corresponded with slower plots. Hitch has established a lighter pace, in order to show essential details.Scenery is magical. Something between fog and sleep. Characterization is almost perfect.James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has managed to combine tension, informality and obsession in one character. He is a victim and avenger"" at the same time. The difference between love and obsession is very small. His guilt turns into anger and disbelief. This is the first film in which Mr. Stewart does not dominate in the usual way. Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster is, due to the dual role, quite amazing. Her acting is not at a high level. However, she is stylish, eerily beautiful and enigmatic. She is torn by internal struggles between love and truth. Characters are not honest. None of them. This is very interesting.Love and passion can be a serious weapon in manipulative games and crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Storytelling issues prevent this from being a truly good film,"This film has two relatively major flaws, both story related.The first issue is that right in the beginning of the film, and then later once again, it smears on you a sudden thick layer of awkwardly placed exposition, like some cheap Japanese anime. This should not be a thing in a professional piece of work like this.The second issue is that, as with many Hitchcock's movies, the story relies on one of the characters being an idiot in order to work. The premise is that a detective affected by vertigo is asked by his old pal to solve a mystery surrounding this friend's wife's strange behaviour and, as you watch the events play out it becomes apparent fairly quickly that the main character is being played. It is obvious, and it should be particularly obvious to a detective, but the movie pretends like it is not.And so, you find yourself mentally trying to hurry the movie up. ""Yes, I get it, the main character is obsessed and is being played. Come on, get to it already, get to the reveal. It's obvious. Come on."" As the movie was drawing out the inevitable, the famous Hitchcockian tension was starting to wear out its welcome, as the dialogue and the music were getting increasingly teary-eyed.And then, at around the 1:40 mark the story takes a nosedive. Instead of revealing the truth at the end, the film spills the beans right then by means of a second blunt exposition pour, where the main twist of the film is simply shown to the audience in a flashback and then explained through the thoughts of one of the characters. Look, movie, I know I was mentally hurrying you up, but I did not mean for you to prematurely unload yourself in the most unsatisfactory manner. What a letdown!The very ending is a bit problematic as well. It feels like the writer did not know for sure what to do with the two main characters after all the cards were revealed. The way the story concludes, feels odd and rushed.It is a real shame because the performances are good. The main character played by James Stewart is charming. The tension is there. There are some special effects used, including animation, which looked cool. Even the premise is quite interesting at face value, but the execution is unfortunately also very noticeably flawed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock delivers another wonder with consistently thought out thriller,"Retiring cop John Ferguson (Stewart) is hired to stalk Madeline Elster (Novak) and finds he is slowly falling in love with the suicidal woman.Vertigo has now become one of the most critically acclaimed crime thrillers by the legendary Brit Alfred Hitchcock.The opening title sequence is excellent; particularly considering it was made in the late 1950s when technologically was restricted. The tantalizing colour montage and shifting images makes the James Bond efforts look like child's play. The accompanying song helps generate a feeling of excitement and we are right at the start of an energetic movie.The opening sequences with Stewart's Ferguson and his job partner chasing an anonymous villain across the rooftops is vintage action and excitement, perfect Hitchcock styling also. Then as Ferguson losses his balance and is caught dangling we have the setup for a beautifully lit film.We learn Ferguson has now retired from developing vertigo with this experience and what follows is a sweet slow build up in the mystery of the beautiful and strange Madeline, an estranged woman played with a sharp vagueness by Kim Novak. Her soft dialogue and timing help set her up for an emotional interplaying manipulative character in the latter stages and is a fine character development by Hitchcock.James Stewart, in his last pairing with the director, is impressive once more with a professional but eager character. This particular role of the star is often remarked as a dent in an otherwise brilliant film.It is perhaps easy to see why as he has no mysterious vigour that his character from Rear Window had and the story perhaps required more from him here in 1958, but I thought he carried the emotional scenes well.Vertigo is labelled as a tantalizing thriller and when comparing it to modern day films with the same tag you wonder if something has gone wrong. There have certainly been rapid developments over the last 50 years and the renowned ones in the 21st century, the Bonds and Bourne's, have that vibrant fast energy with extra charisma. Vertigo is the build up to what was to come, a major influence. The car scenes for example are slowly paced but edge up a gear as the stakes in the plot steadily rise.Vertigo therefore is thankfully not dated but given the vast amounts of modern thrillers, it may seem so to others. It may lack suspense when the romance lingers but the sheer spectacle of the story puts this doubt away.Hitchcock once again has a consistent directional release with wonderful character placement and a fine selection of twists and turns to give the would-be dull parts that excitement. One excellent part is towards the end in the Bell Tower when we see Ferguson's shake up of Vertigo. It is fair no one does a bird's eye view shot like the brilliant Hitchcock, who once again, has made a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A masterpiece of torpor,"It staggers credulity to read that this dull, plodding film with its embarrassingly silly plot has now been rated as the greatest movie of all time. I have watched it three times: in the early 60s when it was first released in the UK, again some 10 years ago and once again last night. Nothing has changed. Vertigo doesn't merit high rating even among Hitchcock's prolific output; to elevate it to all-time supreme status is an unspeakable act of self pomposity from the critics concerned.A film like Vertigo depends almost entirely on raising the viewer's interest in its characters. Disappointing, then, that its two principals play their roles as if they're half-asleep on drugs. James Stewart has many times played with success the seemingly slow-witted, slow moving character who's aware of a lot more than it appears. In Vertigo this Stewart stock persona is inappropriate. One wonders if they first shot the scene where he's mute, staring and unresponding in the hospital and he decided to continue in this mode but mouthing the script lines as they came along.How anyone could begin to fall in love with such a frigid, boring personality as played by Kim Novak is beyond comprehension. She is consistently out-performed by trees, buildings and props throughout the piece. Far from conveying an intriguing, sexually arresting character, she leaves the viewer marvelling that nobody thought to save budget by substituting a tailor's mannequin.Had Vertigo been directed by anyone without Hitchcock's reputation (one that's deserved but which, most unusually, seems to encourage enthusiasts to believe he never makes a clunker) it would have been written off as poor stuff — indeed it was correctly regarded as mediocre when it first came out. It isn't a bad film, in the sense of godawful, laughably inept. It's just so far from good that people with normally functioning eyes and ears will shrug and say ""ho-hum!""",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""I Look Up, I Look Down ...""","A retired cop is hired by a San Francisco shipping magnate to follow his beautiful wife, because she has been behaving oddly.  Scottie Ferguson begins to trail Madeleine, and finds himself powerfully attracted to the disturbed young woman ...""Vertigo"" was inspired by the French novel, ""D'Entre Les Morts"" by Boileau and Narcejac.  Vera Miles was meant to play Madeleine, but she became pregnant.  Plans were already well advanced when Kim Novak stepped in, and the portrait of Carlotta Valdes which intrigues Madeleine is in fact a likeness of Miles herself.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie from TV's ""Dallas"") appears as Midge, the artistic intellectual who once had Scottie but lost him.  Watch for her telling little glance when Scottie mentions their now-defunct engagement. Apparently, Hitchcock gave Bel Geddes minutely explicit directions on when to raise and lower her gaze (""I look up, I look down ..."").  Midge will never regain her place in Scottie's affections and she knows it.  Twice in the course of the film she is referred to as his mother-figure, a role which she seems fated to adopt, against her own inclinations.  The character of Midge is left to wither on the vine.  Once Scottie gets out of hospital there is simply no room for her in the narrative, and we never hear of her again.Midge's pet-name for Scottie is 'Johnny-o', and the strange truth is, Johnny-o is a sicko.  He carries a weighty burden of guilt over the policeman who fell to his death (shades of ""Spellbound""?) and he now suffers from vertigo, the camera lurching queasily whenever he looks down from any height.  This much-imitated Hitchcockian trick consists of zooming the camera in whilst simultaneously tracking back.  The custom-built church tower proved unsuitable for the lurch-shot, so the effect was achieved by filming inside a scale model (laid horizontally, incidentally).Scottie's sickness is insisted upon from beginning to end.  Like a voyeuristic stalker, he pursues Madeleine obsessively, watching her from the shadows.  When he pulls her out of the Bay, he sits her in her car and clinches her like a lover, repeating her name over and over.  He neither calls an ambulance nor informs her husband.  Instead, he drives her to his apartment, undresses her, puts her in his bed and plays with her hair. Later, the way he accosts Judy Barton is threatening and inappropriate. Director of Photography Robert Burks lights Stewart's face from below for the disturbing moment when Scottie begs Judy to dye her hair blonde. Scottie spends an inordinate amount of his on-screen time sitting alone in his car, symbolically trapped in the bubble of his unhealthy sexuality.The colour green is the emblem of Scottie's kinkiness.  Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) whets Scottie's sexual appetite by setting up his first glimpse of Madeleine in Ernie's restaurant.  Her gown has vivid flashes of green, and Scottie becomes fixated. She drives a green car, and Scottie pursues it through San Francisco's gridiron streetplan like satyr chasing faun.  When he sees the car again after his spell in hospital, he runs to it and physically embraces it.  When he spies on Madeleine in the florist's shop, the bright green counter occupies a quarter of the Vistavision screen. Bright green lawns outside the art gallery prefigure the central 'village green' of San Juan Bautista.  These are important sites which Scottie associates with Madeleine.  When he has her at his mercy, naked in his bed, he has on a revolting green sweater.  Madeleine gives in and agrees to accompany him on a date, and he gives a sick smile as he drives her through the lush greenery south of San Francisco.  The phallic sequoia trees are of the genus 'semper virens', translated by Scottie as 'ever green'.  Judy attracts Scottie like a moth to a flame when she looks out of a window, dressed head-to-toe in green.  It is when he sees her silhouette against the green-tinged net curtains that he knows who she really is.  His excitement reaches an unhealthy pitch when she emerges from the bathroom with blonde hair, the room bathed in ugly green light.For a story so carefully prepared by Hitchcock and his writers, Coppel and Taylor, ""Vertigo"" contains some major weak points.  Elster's ruse is unbelievably far-fetched.  To get the half-drowned Madeleine to his apartment, Scottie must have used her car and abandoned his own.  Is that credible?  And how come Madeleine is able to dress and leave in the few seconds it takes Scottie to answer the phone?  The coroner accepts as fact the suicide attempt near the Golden Gate Bridge, even though this evidence can only have come from Scottie, whom the coroner publicly disparages. Would Judy really be so foolish as to wear the necklace which gives her away?  The film's ending is too much to swallow.Kim Novak is on record as saying that Hitchcock insisted on her wearing the grey suit, the exact same one that Scottie forces Judy to wear as he remoulds her identity.  Like Scottie, Hitchcock had a thing about aloof blonde ice-maidens (Hedren, Kelly, Novak) ...  Scottie quotes a Chinese proverb about remaining responsible for a life once you've saved it.  Did Hitchcock feel the same way about the Madeleine/Judy/Marnie girl to whom he had granted life?",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Masterpiece or failure? I agree with the former,"When Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" opened in 1958, it had a cold reception by both critics and audience, and many even consider it a failure in his remarkable career. Even Hitchcock wondered about what went wrong and he blamed lead star James Stewart for the failure. What probably happened, was that this time, Hitchcock's usual walk on the dark side went a bit too far for the times.""Vertigo"", based on Pierre Boileau's novel ""d'Entre Les Morts"", is a dark tale of romance, obsessions and lies, all spiced up with the lead character's acrophobia. James Stewart is our protagonist, as Scottie, he plays a detective whose sudden retire from the police was caused by an accident involving his acrophobia, his fear of heights.Hired by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a mysterious old friend from school; he accepts the mission of following Elster's wife, Madeline (Kin Novak), who supposedly is possessed by the ancient spirit of one of her ancestors, and that eventually will take her life. As Scottie tries to protect Madeline, he falls in love with her, starting a forbidden romance that is doomed from the start. After Scottie fails to save Madeline's life due to the vertigo caused by his acrophobia, his obsession with her take him to commit unexpected actions.Boileau's complex story of obsession may had been too much for the critics and the audience of its time; and watching James Stewart going from a regular guy to a man bordering insanity certainly didn't help the film. Nevertheless, time has proved that ""Vertigo"" was indeed a powerful film undeserving of the cold reception it had.James Stewart gives probably his best performance ever, the sudden fall from grace that eventually take its toll on Scottie is perfectly portrayed by Stewart. Hitchcock was really wrong at blaming James for the failing, as it was the audience who was not ready to see their hero turned into a grotesque monster.Kim Novak plays his role with grace, although certainly her character is not as demanding as Stewart's. The movie is all about Scottie and his failed romance leading to the destruction of his life. This complex persona makes him one of the best fictional characters ever written, let alone portrayed on film.The technical aspects of the movie are superb too, Hitchcock creates a brilliant composition of colors and the visuals are beautiful. Bernard Herrman's score is subtle but fitting, although not as powerful as his famous work on ""Psycho"".If a flaw is to be found, I would say that the script developed for the film was probably not the most friendly for the audience. This film is certainly not for everyone, as it's slow pace and heavy darkness in the subject may turn off people familiar with Hitchcock's lighter films as his usual dark humor is not present here The only film I can relate to ""Vertigo"" in terms of harsh ""darkness"" would be ""The Wrong Man""; although the big difference is, that in that film, the trouble is caused by outside forces, while in ""Vertigo"", we get a glimpse to that dark part of our soul we do not dare to watch.The first time I watched it, I was not sure about what had just happened in front of my eyes, not sure if it was good or bad. After a second watch I guess this is of the kind of films that grow on you. Some consider it a failure and others consider it a masterpiece; my opinion stands closer to the latter: I call it a great piece of cinema. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
From among the dead...,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has a narcotizing effect, a lulling, dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off, which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it. It's also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's ""Scottie"" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Hitchcock at his most revealing best!,"One of Hitchcock's three best movies (North by Northwest and Rear Window are my other two favorites) which I can watch over and over again.The external reviews for Vertigo will give you more insight into this movie than I can but for me, when I first saw this movie in the late '50s (I was very young), it planted the seeds that drove me to move to the bay area from the east. My obsessions were cultivated later.The setting, San Francisco at its prime, with its hills and sharp light contrasts because of the surrounding waters add to the ever changing but hypnotic backdrop of this color film. Even Bernard Herrmann's music score emphasis the mood swings of its characters to pull the viewer into its vortex.Vertigo is a dizzying production of dark and light, ups and downs. It is the story of one man's obsessions for controlling his surroundings and desires to a point where his life is spinning out of control. Or is it? It has been written that Hitchcock in real life was controlling and manipulative (""All actors should be treated like cattle"") and why all the blonde, austere, frigid women? So, plot, acting, direction, photography and music are all mingled to give the viewer a wonderful, mesmerizing, voyeuristic look into obsessive behavior.

A Hitchcock Masterpiece,"Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters. Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him. This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance and I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's `Dallas') also give excellent performances.Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene. Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.

A true Hitchcock classic; Stewart's gutsiest role,"VERTIGO (1958) **** James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes, Tom Helmore, Henry Jones. Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense and romantic obsession: Stewart (in one of his best go-against-the-grain performances) stars as San Francisco cop John 'Scottie' Ferguson, whose eponymous phobia leads him to an on-the-job lethal accident. Sitting out his time off from the force he's enlisted as a private eye to watch a friend's troubled wife Madeleine Elster (the ethereal Novak), who believes she has been reincarnated. Scottie's case leads to complications including the necropheliac emotional overhaul he succombs to after Madeleine's 'suicide' and seeing her in mystery woman Judy Barton (Novak again, proving to be an accomplished actress).More psychological underpinnings you could shake a stick at and thanks to The Master's multi-layered storyline the film never falters largely thanks to the incredibly affective cinematography by Robert Burks, the adaptation of Pieree Bouileau & Thomas Narcejaq's novel 'D'Entre les Morts' by Alec Coppel & Samuel Taylor and once again the excellent chemistry between the tormented Stewart and the bewitching Novak, proving to be one of the most passionate ill-fated couples in cinematic history. Perhaps the icing on the cake is the hauntingly evocative score by long-time collaborator Bernard Herrmann. A true American classic.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""That is a matter between him and his own conscience""","Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception  it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme  neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif  here symbolising rebirth  crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements  a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style. It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on  one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot. While its power to hold me has diminished somewhat over repeated viewings (a weakness of all Hitchcock films, the flipside to their being instantly enjoyable) it still looks amazing and it can still send shivers down my spine. It's an incredible achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Master's Masterpiece.,"It can be argued in many different ways what actually is the best film Alfred Hitchcock ever made. For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way. Maintaining every scene with careful scrutiny and eye for detail, this may be Hitchcock's best showing as a director, and it all leads up to one of the best filmed endings in cinema history and leaves you needing to watch again, hoping to catch a glimpse of the true emotions of Scottie and Judy, or is it Madeline?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's masterpiece.,"My Take: Still one of the most effective and engaging thrillers ever made. An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em.Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it.Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it: This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today.After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"") with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!).

It is oftentimes referred to as the most important film Hitchcock ever made, his masterpiece. While this assertion is purely in the eye of the beholder, there is a unique quality about 'Vertigo'. It is like a fine wine, fermenting over the years to become a landmark film that will haunt and disturb you.Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 vision proves to be a deeply personal quest to the heart of a man's soul and his elusive search for true love. It's a haunting story of obsession, a painful portrait of loss. The picture dives much deeper than we've ever seen Hitchcock do before, and it doesn't always make for comfortable viewing. The nature of the story itself is troubling and difficult to tackle, and 'Vertigo' stands as a true testament as to what Hitchcock was capable of doing with a camera. A man who could tell a story like few others, and in a way that was entirely his own. He made countless great films, but 'Vertigo' strikes at a core where films rarely go.What is it about 'Vertigo' that makes it such an unsettling picture? There's a lingering eeriness throughout it all, a morbid atmosphere, as it acts simultaneously as a romantic love story and a troubling look at obsession. Everyman Jimmy Stewart delivers a memorable performance and brings to life a character who's own mental state seems in serious question. His journey is our journey, and the film taps into a part of the human psyche rarely approached by cinema, and it causes us to feel vulnerable and uneasy but unquestionably transfixed.The wonderful Kim Novak dives into 'Vertigo' in two starring roles, and the object of Stewart's encroaching affection. Filmed in classic technicolor and with a color pallet made up of sensuous greens and tantalizing reds, it only brings out Novak's striking beauty even more. The eyes are a pathway to the soul, and one glance from Novak is more than enough to capture your attention. It all seems to play into Hitchcock's master plan, whose true intentions are sometimes never quite known. Two fascinating leads, a powerful score, lush colors and textures, haunting landscapes, out-of-body dreamscapes. This is classic Hitchcock, and some of his most profound work.'Vertigo' is hypnotically beautiful, and ultimately tragic. There's a complexity here that's difficult to penetrate, and I believe it's how Hitchcock intended it. There are questions we may have, but Hitchcock forever took those answers with him many years ago. And yet there's something about this film that continues to fascinate audiences today, a beating heart that's allowed it to grow over the years but with Hitchcock's original and haunting vision still intact. 'Vertigo' may not be his definitive masterpiece, but it may just be his most accomplished work.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
quick reviews!,"yes, quick, as others reviewers have gone into greater depth, and i can't add anything new.Oh baby, what a film! 1958!!! This has plot twists, even effects that put movies of today to shame. One of the most complex films ever made, with something new arising with each viewing, I think this, along with The Seven Samurai, is the best movie of all time. The first time I watched it, I had no idea how it would end, and what would become of Scotty and Madeleine. My only qualm is the fact that Midge completely disappears from the movie in the second half. Why?! It's not important though. Superbly shot, and immaculately directed, as always. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
these little myths,"This film suffers from the same malady as much of Hitchcock's work, namely trite stories poorly told, surrounded by fine camera work and sets and well-acted scenes.There aren't really holes in the plot, instead the plot itself is a hole. Hitchcock tries to show a kind of psychological prowess but it's.... well, trite. And it isn't even looking back at a different era that makes it so - these were stale ideas at the time of filming. By this time, 1958, Brando had substantially exhausted the psyche-examining genre and Lupino had already trod those paths before him. Edward G Robinson in the 1930s was showing his character's psyches without the sort of preachy methods that Hitchcock resorts to again and again. It's a much more natural effect and has a greater impact.There's an idea floating around that Hitchcock invented the dolly zoom with this film but of course that's nonsense. Lots of older films used it. Bill Seiter was doing it in the 1930s. Griffith was doing it in the 1910s. Ford tried it and failed with The Ringo Kid's entrance, thus the blurry shot; he didn't bother spending the money, or couldn't afford, to run the shot again but you can clearly see the dolly rolling during the zoom. Same thing with 'We're in the Money' from 'Gold Diggers of 1933' the dolly rolls back a full city block while the zoom lets the audience stay on point. Orson Welles knew how to use it effectively in his first film; for example the dramatic entrance by the Nurse in the intro of 'Citizen Kane.' It could be said perhaps that Hitchcock made the trick popular with later directors and film critics, but he certainly didn't invent it.There is a magical quality that Technicolor had which apparently can't be reproduced by other methods. 'Adventures of Robin Hood' and 'Gone With the Wind' are the best of the early examples. One of the very last films to use Technicolor, 1965's 'El Dorado,' has the same ""feel of the film"" as those early films and this movie too, and it's the Technicolor process that creates it. It evokes a certain era of the movies that is now long gone. 'Vertigo' certainly doesn't belong in the same category as those masterpieces, and in spite of the myth around him, Hitchcock doesn't really match up to their directors either. Hawks, Curtiz, Victor Fleming - John Ford and Merv LeRoy too, for that matter - all have an ability to reveal emotions that is quite beyond Hitchcock, who instead resorts to camera trickery in his attempt to achieve what those masters achieve with their casts and crews. But it's still a fine example of film-making by a great director and a decent cast led by one of the greatest actors in history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The second Jimmy Stewart/Hitchcock movie,Vertigo is about Jimmy Stewart portraying a detective named Scottie who quit the academy due to his fear of heights after a recent police chase.He tries by over coming his fear of heights by himself but was unable to accomplish his fear.Recently old college friend hires Scottie to watch his wife Madeleine who has reportedly become possessed by her ancestor's spirit named Carlotta.Madeleine believes she's a reincarnated version of Carlotta and has had visions of places she's never been to before.Scottie kept an eye on Madeleine and eventually started to care for her a lot. He's determined to solve Madeleine's mystery and connection with Carlotta.This Hitchcock film is good. Has some surprising moments like in his other films. Jimmy Stewart is excellent as usual. Strongly recommended to all the Hitchcock and Stewart fans.,7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Slow, boring, ridiculous, and predictable","I finally watched this old chestnut. I read somewhere that it was a flop when it came out but later became recognized as a classic. Apparently Alfred Hitchcock blamed James Stewart's being too old for the part. The two never worked together again. Well, Stewart wasn't the problem. The problem was the script, which is simply asinine. The public was right the first time: the movie is terrible.The hero falls in love with a woman who is supposed to be nuts and who gives him no reason at all to fall in love with her. She has a few mad scenes with him but never engages in any conversation of any substance on any topic, never does any activities with him, etc. On top of that, she is his old friend's wife. Her only attraction is that she is good looking, but lust for a pretty woman isn't love, which is what the hero is supposed to feel. Totally implausible.The movie runs 2 hours. There is a great deal of boring driving around San Francisco and the nearby California coast in the first half of the movie. I started looking at my watch at around 1:15 into the movie. Was this thing ever going to end? At about 1:30 the main plot is revealed. It is pretty silly and quite routine. The remaining 1/2 hour is torture. The plot gets more and more ridiculous, all the while getting more and more predictable. My impatience got more and more intense. When the truly idiotic end finally came, I was both relieved (over at last!) and outraged (what a waste of 2 hours).",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Desperate love story with murder on the wing,"Vertigo (1958)This movie isn't quite about what it seems to be about at first, and we shift from an odd detective case to a case of falling in love, to a case of just falling, and then the movie goes through one of the most convincing psychological twists in cinema. That is, the second portion of the movie is a brilliant inquiry into the mind of the retired detective played by Jimmy Stewart, and into obsession, and eventually to revelation. While the crime is solved eventually, it's really a small point. This is a love story, and a complicated one but also a passionate one. The ending will leave you gasping.There are celebrated aspects to note: the psychedelic insert in the middle as a dream, the zoom/pull effects of vertigo, even the classic femme fatale/plain girl contrast (the latter a brilliant Barbara Bel Geddes). And there are some less known touches, like the green neon lighting used on the interior of the room at the Empire Hotel, or the generally clear vivid brilliant Technicolor palette. There are bit parts and famous sets (the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Bautista Mission, which didn't actually have a bell tower like this one (that was added through cinema trickery).There is also an amazing use of subjective effects--the light falling improbably, or a haze covering the scene for no reason except the main character's mind. Much of this stuff pushes Hitchcock into true art film territory, and yet he keeps it a mainstream commercial flick that is accessible and popular.Most of all there is subtle deception between characters and between the movie and the viewer. Hitchcock has never preferred the sudden surprise, leaving the viewer in ruins (or just in shock). Instead, he tells you what's going on--in this case, we learn of the murderous truth halfway through the film, so that we aren't wasting energy solving the crime but are instead trying to get into the characters' heads. It is the psychology, and the conflict of desire and doubt, that drive the movie. It's not slow, by the way, it's lyrical.Some people might object to the falseness of many of the key scenes, but that's the nature of films that are not purely naturalistic. And the nature of nearly all of Hitchcock movies after 1940. Absorb the style as brush strokes--they don't get in the way of verisimilitude once you agree the truth is not the point. Drama and beauty and originality are. All of those are here full force.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Very Intense!,"This is not bad for a 50's movie. Especially if it's from Alfred Hitchcock. The beginning of the movie didn't look like anything from that era. I mean, the title and the background effects, it looked more scientific to any era. The affects of a phobia always impairs a person's work. And conquering them shouldn't be a problem. But if the person has ""Vertigo"", like the main character, conquering the fearing always have drawbacks. Scottie Fergerson(James Stewart) has vertigo and the fear of heights, that effected his work and cost a police officer's life. The guilt haunts him. Midge Woods(Barbara Bel Geddes, before DALLAS), is a designer and painter who seems to be the stronger characters in the movie. I thought is was funny when she painted the picture of the sitter with her likeness in it. For Scottie, he was not amused. SHAME ON YOU, SCOTTIE! However, the obsession made him too obsessed on finding out the mystery woman he's tailing. The woman(Kim Novak) was somehow just a pawn instead of the culprit when Scottie's friend hired him to look out. Guilt followed him again when she jumped off the roof, or so it seemed. The real pawn in the movie was Scottie himself. His own friend took advantage of his condition, and try to make him feel guilty again. Conquering the fear of heights is not easy, only if you let it persist. Like the old saying, The only thing you have to fear its fear itself.

A very apt pupil,"Perhaps the best word to describe Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is ""bizarre"". The film even gives this impression with the twisting imagery and hypnotic music of its title sequence. Next, John Ferguson is introduced as a detective that retires due to his inexorable fear of heights. An old friend of John's contacts him and asks him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, which he explains is a result of supernatural forces. John is skeptical and reluctant, but quickly takes the case and begins to observe a bizarre chain of events.James Stewart plays the role John Ferguson and is effective at portraying the transition from impartial investigator to an increasingly involved and even unnerving one. Kim Novak is also excellent as the enigmatic and sporadic Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is also memorable as Midge, particularly in the ""painting"" scene.Most of the story doesn't rely on direct plot twists, but rather a methodical investigation of the mystery presented near the film's beginning and the interesting and peculiar behavior of the subject under investigation. The film is well-made such that it doesn't tip its hand early as to the solution to the mystery, but when the film's major twist does come it is brilliant. This methodical approach is effective, although personally I preferred other Hitchcock films that featured more twists over this one. The film's bizarre quality is developed with the help of eerie music and unorthodox effects sequences, including an interesting effect to represent John's fear of heights.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Superlative piece of cinema,"When I first saw Vertigo, I was too young to appreciate it. Years later, I gave it another look and was totally blown away. I love Hitchcock, he hardly ever fumbled in his entire career, and this is among his very, very best (along with Shadow of a Doubt).Never mind what some have said about Stewart looking too old -- his age is one of the main things that makes this movie work. If Scotty hasn't been around the track a few times, where is the tragedy of his complete and total fall into obsession with a young, beautiful and unattainable woman? In addition to which, JS does some of his greatest acting here. The final climb into the tower is a tour de force, an absolute masterpiece of film acting that has to be seen multiple times to be fully comprehended.Another thing about Vertigo that makes it remarkable for me among Hitch's films: he didn't have some of his usual collaborators here. Vera Miles was pregnant, so her role went to Kim Novak. Barbara Bel Geddes is another unusual (and terrific) choice. Not seeing so many faces I associate with other great Hitchcock films somehow gives Vertigo a special life of its own. Beautifully written, shot, cut and acted and what a phenomenal ending. When there was nothing more to say, Hitch, to his credit, said nothing. (The supplemental ending is garbage.) Take a look at Vertigo; it's amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Heightened tension,"Vertigo is a film whose plot elements have been borrowed many times and has been a huge influence on Brian De Palma.James Stewart is a San Francisco detective Scottie Ferguson who develops a fear of heights during a rooftop chase in the opening scenes of the film.An old college friend Gavin Elster hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) because she might be possessed by some ancestral spirit. Scottie becomes enchanted, even obsessed by Madeleine who he saves from suicide and falls in love. However later throws herself from a church and he is unable to save her because of his fear of heights, Scottie falls into a deep depression.After he has got better he finds a girl (Judy Barton) who reminds him of Madeleine and he also becomes obsessed with wanting her to look and dress like Madeleine which leads the film to another diversion.The restored version of this film looks gorgeous although it also highlights the backdrop in Stewart's apartment. Novak in dual roles simply shines and the film is intriguing. Barbara Bel Geddes who has a thing for Scottie disappears half way through the film as her role becomes redundant and James Stewart does well as he again looks to become unhinged once he becomes transfixed with Judy Barton.However the film's denouement two thirds way of the film feels unsatisfactory and I can see why Hitchcock was not happy about it. The mystery would had been better resolved at the end of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A MOVIE THAT WILL STAIN YOUR MIND OF EMOTION..,"I just recently rented this movie from a video store and did not think of it to be all that- I figured just another IL' movie but boy was I wrong! I can honestly say this is a spectacular movie on a totally different level compared to movies of today. The story is not a very complex, Its your typical drama/murder-mystery, but the way Big Al had the actors do their scenes was just perfect and this in turn makes the movie very strong and captivating to watch. The cast could not be any greater; Jimmy Stewart' who doesn't know this guy-But the real shocker is the blonde in the gray suit-actress Kim Novak, who I did not know was awesome in this movie.I am a 29 year old guy that has seen his fair share of movies but none that stain my mind the way this one did.

"As I Grow Old, Part 2","For reasons pretty much spelled out in my review of The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is another film that I appreciate more with age.I can be succinct about this. James Stewart's performance is his best. His character's obsession, whether or not you think it the result of unconscious seduction, is made all the more gripping because we are so much more accustomed to his portraying characters who are direct, purposive, honest and forthright. In a sense Scottie is...until he isn't.Kim Novak is, simply put, beautiful to the point of unearthliness. But this triangle has four sides, and Barbara Bel Geddes is also very much the player. She too is beautiful...or at least given her profession you get the idea she full well knows how to judge beauty...yet she cannot possibly compete with Scottie's fixation, which makes her recognizing that all the more painful and the instant focus of our sympathy.Where does age come in? How readily each of us can place ourselves in each character's shoes. The smug would doubtless think, ""You can't always get what you want,"" but how long did it actually take each of us to learn that? Not only the players but Hitchcock himself had to have known and understood that, and in his peerless directorial fashion he enhanced the portrait, adapting even the surroundings to suit. To me the plot is at times but a contrivance...until the very end.A postscript concerning Bernard Herrmann's musical score: Get a good recording and play the opening theme at theater volume without any visuals or even an attempt to recall the Saul Bass title sequence. In fact, darken the room you're in or listen at night. The music throbs and pulsates. Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great Acting and Thills + Hitchcock= What Might Be the Best Picture Caught On Film,"This movie is just breathtaking with all its visuals and its aura is just amazing. The cinematography and of course the directing and impeccable acting is just many of the ingredients to Hitchcock's masterpiece. It is undoubtedly his best work, and is a cinematic masterpiece to this day, it is one of the best pictures caught on film, so pure and enigmatic to film history, it flows like good wine. Anyone who doesn't agree doesn't understand film at all, or is just one-sided or biased against this film. THe only way this film should ever be remade is if Hitchcock rises from the grave to direct it himself, otherwise it should never be touched or ruined, and left alone as the masterpiece it is. This is a masterpiece through all cinema's history, so hopefully Hollywood will get the point, and not touch it.

A Work of Art,"I'm not sure I can adequately express what I feel about this film. It's hypnotic, almost surreal. Does anyone else think that? Maybe it's the way it was shot, or the score, or the actors but the net effect on me is that I'm watching a movie but I'm also watching something more than just a movie. It's almost like you're viewing a work of art, something not unlike a great painting or piece of sculpture. And no matter how many times you view it, it still has a profound effect on you.This feeling is something you either get or don't get. I know all sorts of people who say it's boring or it's tedious or it's not believable. These are the ones who don't ""get it."" But it's like someone else's comment here about the film....see it 20 times and you'll come to realize how magnificent it is. To compare Vertigo to North by Northwest is preposterous. I love NBNW but Vertigo is Hitchcock's crowning achievement. Many claim it's the greatest movie ever made and I'm not prepared to argue with them.Another thought....the scene where Judy emerges from the bathroom, now totally transformed by Scotty back into Madeleine, and bathed in the soft green neon light of the hotel sign, and with Herrmann's leitmotif, played heretofore in various unfulfilled versions, now fully realized and climaxed....well, this is unquestionably the most beautifully spine-tingling moment in the history of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Obsession with mystery,"The basic plot: An ex-police officer with fear of heights is assigned by a friend of his to keep an eye on his seemingly off-the-edge of sanity wife , but he soon becomes enamored with Madeliene and when she commits suicide ,he finds another girl with a passing resemblance to her who he has clothed, dressed , and done ultra-specifically like Madeliene, but then he learns her secret......The praise: Incredibly dreamy and cool, actually an allegory of the human love of the difficult and mysterious, the strange and the icy(Madeliene), over the plain and familiar( Midge, his ex-fiancee ), and the natural urge to explore and obsess with the strange,scary and beautiful  in the human sex urges.            Oh,yeah and James Stewart and Kim Novak are truly great in their respective roles. Jimmy Stewart is near-perfect as the mild-mannered soul with kernels of obsession both sexual and for a single mysterious woman , with a phobic fear of heights, known as Scotty. Kim Novak is perhaps perfect, drawing on wells of truly deep emotion and currents of beauty untold. Oh yeah, there is a great swooning Bernard Herrman score. It is the most stylish movie , elegantly photographed and designed with a truly elegant beauty that is both modern,old, and religious.There also is great suspense along the way , thrills,chills and mood.

This was a far better experience overall.The major complaint that I had with my previous viewing (Rear Window) was that I could not feel the stakes, nor did I get a feel of the supposed suspense; however, here I did.I liked the way the tale meets its end, a bit tragic, yes, but a befitting conclusion nonetheless!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Still an enthralling masterpiece,"I'm not sure I'd say this is Hitchcock's finest film (personally there are so many masterpieces he made - Psycho, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, The Man Who Knew Too Much, etc. that it's hard to choose) but it is definitely ONE of his finest films.A twisting thriller that opens with a bang and follows the physical and psychological journey of an ex-cop (James Stewart) who has a fear of heights and an obsession with a mysterious woman (Kim Novak) that leads to a chilling finale.As a filmmaker I find this extremely inspiring and along with the work of Scorsese, Kubrick, Cameron, et al, this is one of the films that EVERY filmmaker points to at one time or another. Hitchcock practically reinvented cinema techniques with this. Some of them (such as the lens effects) are outdated and could be altered more drastically nowadays but that is irrelevant - it still holds up despite its dated quality and that's what matters.

Oh Dear - What a MESS!,"This film is exceedingly annoying to watch - unless you happen to be one of the multitude of pretentious fools who think their intellect is better than everyone else's because they ""get it"". Well, I have news for those dumb-asses: There is nothing to get.Vertigo is plodding, annoying, and the pacing is terrible. The characters do not act like real people; it's yet another film where this is the case. What makes it all the more infuriating is that there IS a clever story buried under all the sewage, clawing to get out. And it never does. Even at the end, there's a brief moment where things actually make sense - where there is some semblance of reality - only for it to be dashed by one of the most ludicrous finales I HAVE EVER SEEN. It's THAT BAD. That ending would be laughed out of the cinema today (and probably was back then), but because this film is considered a 'classic', it's applauded as some kind of masterpiece. It isn't. It's just an exceedingly daft finale to a grossly unrealistic film.The only way I could possibly enjoy Vertigo is if I had very little logical thinking. Unfortunately for all the die-hard movie buffs masturbating in unison, I am not a conformist who feels a need to nod their head in agreement, just because society says I am in the presence of brilliance.

Great heights,"Hitchcock's masterpiece? Well, that's debatable, when there are at least six other major contenders I could think of. And yes, I've read the criticisms, about James Stewart being too old in the lead, the twist revealed half an hour before the ending, Judy's lack of surprise when Scottie turns up at her door and more, but in a great movie, you suspend these inconsistencies and instead let yourself get wrapped up in the whole experience.Right from the start, from Saul Bass's literally eye-popping title sequence and Bernard Hermann's hypnotic theme music, a spell is created although being Hitchcock, this is occasionally punctured with surprise elements. Immediately we're catapulted into a thrilling roof-top chase, culminating in the tragic consequences of Stewart's Scottie Ferguson character's vertigo. He seems to suffer a nervous breakdown and despite the devoted attention of the adoring Barbara Bel Geddes, he falls into a carefully contrived murder plot managed by an old friend, keen to inherit his wife's fortune. To do this, Scottie is manipulated into tailing and then building up a relationship with Kim Novak's Madeleine, yet another of the director's icy cool blondes, his vertigo ruthlessly exploited as the murder is perpetrated. However a chance meeting on the street with Madeleine's doppelgänger leads them both back to the scene of the crime with tragic consequences for both.I don't think there's another of Hitchcock's films where he displays his genius so well. The legendary fluidity of his camera we see time and again, it being particularly suited to the rise and fall of the streets of San Francisco as Scottie pursues his prey. Of course it's a sexy film and naturally being Hitchcock, there's a dark undercurrent to this, what with the ""romantic hero"" indulging in something approaching necrophilia in recreating his dream (but dead) woman, plus just how does Madeleine end up naked in his bed, after he's saved her from drowning? The pacing is exemplary, at key points time is compressed for dramatic effect, at other times the camera languidly relaxes allowing the viewer to witness the wonderful cinematography of Frisco's landmarks in the bright Californian sunshine.The dramatic finish, where we're literally left hanging with Stewart and wondering what his next move will be atop the clock tower as his dream is destroyed a second time is a masterpiece of brevity and suspense.Essays have been written about this film almost since it was first released, itself a sign of the complexity and the depth at work here. I'm not one for re-watching films too much, preferring to see something I never have before, but ""Vertigo"" keeps dragging me back in wonder and admiration of one of the masters of cinema at his considerable best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Master Does It Again,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of excellent films. This James Stewart - Kim Novack film is a gem. The cast is extremely well suited for the film. Vera Miles was the original choice of Alfred to play Novaks role but production delays because of Hitch's Gall Bladder surgery & then Miles could not do the film because she was pregnant.The script is based upon a French novel, the original working title of the film is ""From the Dead"".Stewart is a policeman who gets a fear of heights on the job, & then his fears are played by a evil one who cons him into believing someone he loves is dead. He nearly goes off a commits suicide when he finds out he has been used for a dishonest purpose when he finds the girl he fell in love with, only to lose her again.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie on Dallas) is dandy in support as Stewarts lady in waiting. Novak, Stewart, & Bel Geddes are intense in their roles. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) & Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale on the Beverly Hillbillies) also do support roles.This film has great special effects The restored version looks great with over $1 million dollars invested in it by Universals restoration team. San Francisco & the Bay Bridge look very well in the shots there. Hitchcock actually chose the locations for this film while he was shooting Strangers on Train in 1951. San Francisco never looks better on film then in this one.Bernard Herman does a great score.

The camera moves up from her lips and settles upon her eyes as a whirlpool of concentric colours begin to appear, becoming more and more beautiful and guiding the viewer like a hypnotist's timepiece into the depths of the subconscious mind.""Do you believe that someone out the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?"" This question becomes the pivotal inquiry of the entire film as the rational, level headed detective Scotty is slowly but fatefully drawn into a swirling vortex of fragmented images contrasting the past and the present, love and reason, fate and free will, and life and death.After an old college friend named Gavin Elster asks him to investigate the activities of his wife Madeleine because of her strange obsession with her deceased great-grandmother Carlotta Valdez, Scotty reluctantly agrees to help. He is unaware that the woman that he is made to believe is Madeleine Elster is in reality an impostor named Judy Barton who is Elster's mistress and co-conspirator in the planning of the murder of the real Madeleine.Scotty's investigation into the activities of Madeleine's impostor lead him to a flower shop and then to the graveyard tomb of Carlotta. Back in the car he is led to an art gallery where he sees ""Madeleine"" seated in front of a portrait of Carlotta. He notices that she carries a bouquet similar to the one Carlotta holds in the portrait and that she wears her hair in a similar French twist. The woman subsequently drives to the San Francisco Bay area where she leaps into the water. Scotty manages to perform a heroic rescue. He takes the girl back to his apartment to dry her clothes. The stage has now been set from a series of disjointed visual images provided by a well manipulated setup of ""coincidental"" meetings to an episode involving actual verbal communication and Scotty is well on his way into a vortex of illusion. The young woman begins to convince Scotty that her motives to commit suicide are driven by the actions of her Great Grandmother who died by her own hand many years earlier at the similar age of twenty-six.Hitchcock makes great use of imagery, colour and costuming in presenting his film. For example, the vertigo effect appears repeatedly, from the initial swirling credit patterns, to the near-death rooftop scene, to the disintegrating floral effects during the wonderfully orchestrated Scotty's nightmare scene, to the tunnel-like vision of the hallway during Midge's visit to Scotty's doctor and, of course, to the final mission tower sequence.The colour green is strongly used throughout the film. Madeleine's impostor drives a green Jaguar and various tones of green reoccur continually as the movie progresses. Her character is initially resplendent in a green gown and later upon her initial introduction as Judy she is wearing a forest green dress. The prevalent use of the green symbolism creates images strongly representative of the continuation of life theme that is reinstated during ""Madeleine's"" visit with Scotty in the forest and their discussion over the cut down coniferous ""evergreen"" tree.Madeleine's impostor also makes effective ""ghostly"" appearances wearing a gray suit and also a white coat with a black scarf, both costumes wonderfully contrasted against her platinum blonde hair. Like a vapour she sometimes makes momentary disappearances, on one occasion from a hotel and on another while walking in the forest. There are some interesting shadow shots of her as well, one as she stands in the doorway upon a late night visit to Scotty, another in profile as Judy Barton in her apartment and perhaps the most effective shot is from behind as she sits on an old fashioned carriage at the mission.After Scotty fails to prevent ""Madeleine's"" suicide, she appears by ""chance"" on the street wearing a green dress as Judy Barton. Scotty eventually attempts to ""remake"" Judy (clothes, hair, make-up) into his vision of Madeleine and for a while he appears successful. One night, during preparations for dinner at Ernie's, a nightspot where he first gazed upon her as ""Madeleine,"" he discovers that Judy is, in actual fact, wearing Carlotta's portrait necklace. Scotty then drives Judy to the mission tower where ""Madeleine"" died. In an attempt to overcome his fears and to be ""free of the past,"" he forces Judy to the top of the tower. During the resulting physical and emotional altercation he sometimes calls her Judy and then Madeleine. The identities have become a blur; the vortex effect has once again enthralled him. Judy confesses to assisting in the murder of the real Madeleine and pleads for protection. The shadow of a nun climbing the stairs appears to frighten Judy off the ledge and she falls to her death from same tower from which the real Madeleine was thrown.The film's impact is primarily upon the subconscious mind, probing questions about the nature and reasons for interactions with select individuals, their impact and the role they play in the blueprint of our lives. The film opens the door to speculation about the connection between the past, present and future and the role that single and collective perspectives have in determining our experience and destiny. Finally, the film asks the age old question; is the survival of consciousness a reality and are life and death simply doors of admission to interconnected ongoing realms of possibility?",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Another Hitchcock masterpiece!,"I'm a latecomer to Hitchcock's films, only discovering them some 10 years ago.  But it didn't take long for me to discover which ones were the most brilliant of his work.""Vertigo"" is one of those films that needs repeated viewings to understand every detail.  Even I was fooled the first time I watched it!  I give a lot of credit to James Stewart's fine acting in this film.  At first, it appears he's about to launch into yet another of his familiar ""friendly man"" roles. But as the film evolves, you start seeing him unravel.  First, he's convinced to shadow an old friend's wife, despite his own objections. Next, we realize he's not just shadowing, he's turned into something of a voyeur (and starting to fall for the girl he's been tailing).  When he witnesses her death, he completely unravels and we see yet another side, the disturbing side where he's seemingly lost all touch with reality.  (The nightmare sequence is, to me, one of the most tense in the movie.)  He slowly recovers during the balance of the film, only to be shocked once again at the conclusion.  (And Hitchcock wisely left the after-effects of the conclusion up to the minds of his audience.)Kim Novak is also stunning as the woman being tailed, and as the ""down home"" girl Stewart recognizes on the street, a total role reversal.  Barbara Bel Geddes also does a nice job as the mothering, love-lorn lingerie designer who just can't seem to do just enough to get Stewart to fall head over heels for her.At times, the film seems a little slowly paced.  This may be for the effect of having the audience percolate and simmer while the characters develop. We're kept in suspense as Stewart trails Novak around San Francisco.  And we're jolted out of our trance after he rescues her out of the bay.  We're later seduced as Novak dries off in his apartment.  And shocked as one disaster marks the pivotal point in the film.  Hitch was good at suspense, and there are many different kinds of suspense in this film.  Definitely one of his best!",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Detectives.,"No superlatives.  Detectives.  Sherlock Holmes - personally detached from crime.  Reads clues in the material world.  Navigates London, time and place can be read and contained.  Scottie Ferguson.  Obviously not detached.  He can't read material world because it doesn't exist, for two reasons: one, the world he sees has been created by someone else, a god/author figure, Gavin Elster, who like a good director gives Scottie a synopsis and a general idea of the plot, and then lets the actor (remember Hitch called them 'cattle') think he's improvising.Two, because even if the world wasn't an illusion, Scottie's vision is.  He cannot interpret what's in front of him, because he can't see it.  No more than any of us can.  Even before he begins the Madeleine/Carlotta chase, he first sees her at Ernie's, but not for what she is, a woman in a restaurant, but bathed in a strange, 'unrealistically' motivated glow.In Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Daedelus distinguishes between Plato's  realm of 'formless' ideality, with Aristotle's more material philosophy, 'what you d--- well have to see'.  VERTIGO points up the shortsightedness of this viewpoint - Scottie sees what he sees, but it is a world of formless ideality.  But Scottie's love isn't an illusion - not only is it real and painful, but it is psychosomatic: his mental anguish is suppressed and comes out in his body, and he becomes catatonic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Possibly the most overrated movie ever made,"You know what I think? I think everyone who has seen this film only remembers the ending. After a certain turning point near the end of the film, it lives up to it's reputation in every way. Up until then, it's a poorly paced, criminally overrated film.They call Hitchcock the ""Master of Suspense"". Sure he has earned the title, and films like Psycho, Frenzy or Rear Window are proof. Well, I don't know what happened but he was sure missing that gift in '58. Most of the film falls flat, and the first hour and a half or so, with a couple rare exceptions, drags on at a snails pace.The actors were good for the most part. Stewart gives a great performance from beginning to end, while Novak does her best work after the turning point. She seemed to be asleep for most of the first hour and a half. The supporting cast isn't awful, but not nearly as good as I would have expected.Now, there must be some reason why people hail this as Hitchcock's masterpiece? Of course there is: The ending. I wont ruin it for any of you who haven't forced yourselves to sit through this, but the ending is incredible. A couple good twists followed by a huge shocker, this is what people remember about the film.This is all-in-all a pretty lackluster film. The dream sequence and the ending are great, as are the lead actors, but everything else seems to fall flat. One of the most overrated films I've ever seen.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Olive oil on rubber plant leaves,"""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock﻿), deserves its reputation as the greatest American film ever made. Despite its ridiculously far-fetched story, it mesmerizes even after dozens of screenings. As great as Hitchcock's form is here, Bernard Hermann﻿'s beautiful, symphonic score is also essential to the experience. It would be nice if some of the growing numbers of young head-down-and-texters would venture over to the revival theater showing this cinematic landmark in order to understand how much farther great culture can lift a soul than a QWERTY keyboard can.""Vertigo"" opens with an enigma: How does San Francisco Detective John ""Scotty"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) survive hanging from a rain gutter from a great height? No hint is provided. The murder plot is similarly perplexing. For example, how could a murderer risk easy exposure if the intended witness manages to overcome acrophobia and climb the stairs of a steep tower? We toss away plausibility when experiencing Hitchcock's universe, but the payoff here is huge.The famous reveal in 'Vertigo' is the subject of much scholarly discussion. (The film's twist is revealed about 25 minutes before it might have used as a surprise.) According to legend, every leading figure involved in the production disagreed with Hitchcock on the reveal, including Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had to fend them off. In his subsequent interview with François Truffaut﻿, he explains his preference for suspense, not surprise.There are several very widely-read biographies of Alfred Hitchcock with co-workers all saying he was impossible to like on a personal level. In ""Vertigo"", the two leads have a strong argument. Despite how effortlessly the very gifted Jimmy Stewart﻿ plays Scotty, Hitchcock is said to have blamed Stewart's premature aging for ""Vertigo's"" box office failure. Hitchcock never worked with Stewart again, breaking up a legendary collaboration (of four superlative films). In addition, Hitchcock was unhappy with Kim Novak﻿, and is said to have publicly criticized her after 'Vertigo' was released. (Novak maintained a dignified silence.) I don't know what Hitchcock said about Novak, but it seems that Hitchcock has some thin department-store models showing off female clothing to Scotty and Madeleine. Also, when one of the sales women tells Scotty that Judy can wear a particular woman's suit after ""alterations,"" perhaps the comment and the slender models are both knocks on Novak's weight.Still, Hitchcock's characters show tremendous depth. Scotty's former love interest Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is uniquely endearing. The scene where Midge tearfully destroys her witty painting (a spoof on Scotty's obsession) is really heart-wrenching. So is Midge's final appearance, the somber walk down the hallway in the sanitarium. Hitchcock really connects with lonely hearts through Midge. It is ironic that an artist as universally disliked by the people who worked with him could produce such profound moments with common people as we see him portray Scotty's forgotten ex-girlfriend. People tend to forget this when teeing off on Alfred Hitchcock, the man.If you have watched 'Vertigo' a few time notice how Hitchcock manipulates point of view. For example, when we first see Scotty after the opening predicament, he is in Midge's apartment. Seated but physically diminished, Scotty is balancing a cane when he says, ""ouch."" The background is particularly busy. There is visual chaos all around Stewart's outline. It looks as if the background objects just fell from a height, not Scotty. Scotty is being under-appreciated.It is also interesting when another point of view (besides Scotty's) is being represented. For example, we see the floating petals from Madeleine's flower just before she jumps into San Francisco Bay. Another example is when Madeleine revisits the murder with her flashback. It lasts a few seconds but her side of the story is clearly identified. (That is, it appears filmed in a manner that conveys her as a reluctant pawn in a larger conspiracy.) Hitchcock is never just pointing a camera at a set where some action is taking place. He plans every visual detail before filming begins.Cinephiles already know what a great film 'Vertigo' is. It is a perennial pleasure that never gets stale. However, please don't take any ill-advised leaps across rooftops getting to the revival theater showing it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Another masterpiece from the Master,"""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.""Hitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obsessed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to classify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here.The film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beginning of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beginning and midway through the story, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Magical journey into Fear,"This is maybe the one time Hitch mixed almost-Fantasy elements with one of the most intense primal fears of mankind: The fear of falling, and built a highly suspenseful mystery around it.Along with the classic camera moves which depict James Stewart's ""vertigo"" (Ie, the elongation of one long shot, a camera move which is copied and used and ab-used by director after director: Example, in ""Lord of The Rings: Return Of The King"" Frodo looks into Shelob's Lair: The closer elements in the shot stay stationary, but the farther elements seem to move away from the camera. This is straight from Vertigo).This camera trick was possibly originated by Hitch and was used in Vertigo each time James Stewart looks into a Void area: Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of this is the best pictorial representation of fear of heights, mixed with fear of vast open spaces (However this phobia is classified)- This is hard to describe unless the experience is common, Hitchcock must have had the same fear, because his depiction of it matches my experience with it- And so, as Stewart looks down, from the top of the apartment building, and later in the film when he looks straight down the Bell Tower, that visual effect where the far away parts of the image stretch away from the camera view, this gives people who do not have acrophobia and the other related fears a visual representation of what a person with those fears goes through.And James Stewart's reactions to heights during the film are not too fantastic, especially the standing on the top step of a step-stool, it is not too ridiculous that he had a vertigo attack at that point. It is important for the viewer to understand how debilitating Vertigo and Acrophobia are when mixed together, and Hitch gives us a visual taste of these fears within minutes of the opening shots of the film when Stewart looks down and the world stretches.Hitch adds to the mix, a story which is almost time-travel or psychic... Kim Novak's character pulls the wool over not only Stewart's eyes, but ours as well. She is at her most convincing when she is looking at the tree rings and saying ""I was born around here, and I died here..."" We do not know anything but Stewart's fear of heights and his apparent guilt feelings at not being able to prevent an apparent tragedy from occurring... Just in case we do not really understand this Hitch added one of the most fantastic ""Dream Sequences"" of all his movies, which is rife with clues of all sorts as to what is really going on.And this dream sequence causes Vertigo to be visually stunning. Although Hitch uses all kinds of tricks during the film to add an unreality and eeriness to the story, Stewart's Dream centers his, and our, fears into the story, and also elements are added that hint to Stewart, and to us, that there is more going on here.When Stewart finds Judy Barton, as he becomes more and more obsessed with dressing her up as Madeline, the film becomes more and more removed from ""reality"" - especially when Stewart has an Epiphany, nothing in the shot has any substance but Madeline/Judy- The background becomes washed out, it is as if the only things that exist in our universe are James and Madeline/Judy.And as the film reaches denouement, this quality reverses until everything looks quite normal.There are too many aspects of this picture to evaluate: The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his best and one of the most spiritual in any Hitchcock film.Also the best use of a city as location, San Francisco in the late 50's, and some of the landmarks shown are still there. A lot of the scenery included many places that I remember that endeared San Francisco to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Classic Hitch Thriller,"Vertigo is a special kind of film. This is because it doesn't follow the usual way a film is presented to the viewer. Rather than having the main suspense near the end of the film, Vertigo has this high level of suspense at both the end and middle of the film. Few could have pulled this off quite as well as Hitch.I really liked this film in the stylish way it was presented. Time is not overly spent getting into the characters here, they are simply presented for who they are leaving the judgement up to the viewer. The ""Vertigo"" special effect and the nightmare sequence were done like nothing I have ever seen for a film of this time and are enchanting and timeless. The plot and storyline of this film are both original and not cliched. The audience is taken by surprise during the middle of the film and from there on the film becomes even more suspenseful.Jimmy Stewart put another of his great performances into this film and played well opposite Kim Novak's dark and confused character. Stewart shows the full range of emotions as he is taken by the alluring Madeline (Novak) and is driven to a deep depression. Novak had been criticized for playing her role too darkly which is a claim I find completely unfounded. For a woman who is going through so much stress (or at least we are to believe that), she plays as well as this role could have been done. The interesting thing about the performances in this film is how much time Stewart and Novak are on the screen. For 95% of the film, there is not another character to add anything else to the plot. Other than Barbara Bel Geddes, who gives a short, supporting performance, the film revolves around the realtionship between Ferguson (Stewart) and Madeline.I must say that I enjoyed this film just as much as Rear Window and would even put this one above North by Northwest. Hitchcock does suspense so well and is quite obvious to see why he is imitated so much. A recommendation to all.8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Alfred Hitchcock's Pre-""Psycho"" Psycho","Vertigo has got to be one of the most absurd and disturbing movies about men and their ""modern-day"" mental illnesses that I have ever seen. It's true.The mental illness that I'm talking about here is, of course - Men's totally twisted and fanatical obsession about having complete and absolute control over women.You know, I'd say that when it comes to one of Hitchcock's most psychotic ""movie-psychos"" of all-time - Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo makes Norman Bates from Psycho look, by comparison, as if he were ""normal"", yes, NORMAL. I mean, Scottie was one really whacked-out maniac, that's for sure!Personally, I think that director Alfred Hitchcock went way too far out on a shaky limb with this one. And, being way out there, he ended up losing his balance and, literally, getting ""vertigo"", himself. This film is nothing but a bird's eye view of a supremely grotesque freak show with Scottie (representing the average American psycho, I mean, the average American male) as the main monster of attraction.At a running time of 130 minutes, Vertigo really only begins to pick up steam in the last 30 minutes.

A Visual Work of Art That Must be Seen on the BIG Screen...,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO has always been able to connect over the years, whether on TV or the restored video version.  To really appreciate this incredible flick from the Master of Suspense, you MUST see it on the big screen in 70mm.  Check the papers for revival houses in your area where old films from Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" can truly be revered.  The opening title sequence, one of the best in cinema history created by the immortal Saul Bass (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, CAPE FEAR), seemed entirely new to me in the darkened theatre.  Hitch made his most artistic picture with wondrous color schemes and amazing screen composition.  Just look at the ghostly greens and reds that help this complex tale absorb you and engage you.  Kim Novak's character is absolutely ""from amongst the dead"" in the mind of Jimmy Stewart (in his second best role) and the lengths that he and Hitchcock go to are exhausting and mystifying.Most film buffs know that VERTIGO is considered Hitch's most personal film, mostly because of how he molds his actresses to look perfect much like the Stewart character does with Novak. The two actors have fantastic chemistry that changes drastically from initial obsession, to love, then back to obsession.  Not much happens in terms of pure action, but as pure cinema, this movie is a landmark.  I can't remember a film that can be so visually captivating without a word of dialogue for long stretches of time.  The viewer becomes just as obsessed with ""Madeleine"", played sensually by Novak. It really is hard to figure out if there are some supernatural undertones at work, especially in the world of Hitchcock.Bernard Herrman's legendary score sounds crisp and emotional in its new, restored form and is as much a character in the film as the colors and the flowers and the hair twists that come to mean so much as the film progresses.  The ""special sequence"", or nightmare that Stewart has is VERTIGO's crowning achievement.  The animation and coloring must have awed audiences of 1958, who actually did not accept the movie at the time. Time has done wonders to VERTIGO and the people at Universal who painstakingly put the film back together for theatrical release have done an amazing job. I only hope the rumors regarding a restoration of REAR WINDOW are true. Look for it in late 1999 !?RATING: 10 of 10 NOTE: Stewart's best performance was in the great MR.

a stunning success,"This is a stunning film that really is the product of a master craftsman. Some people complain it is slow but really it is not it is just we are now used to being fed movie of a faster pace full of fast cuts. But what we have here is a fantastic study of Hitchcock's of obsession and misogyny. Where all the characters are given room to breath. It is not good to give away too much of the plot or that can relatively spoil the movie on a first viewing. The film is basically the study of one man John 'Scottie' Ferguson's obsession with one woman. The surrounding plot is really secondary to that (Hitchock's famous McGuffin). James Stewart is on magnificent form here (there really is no modern actor who could play his everyman role so well). The way each and every shot is shaped and crafted here is truly great, and we also get something which you rarely see in films these days, scenes with no little to no dialogue where the image tells the story, and here this is used superbly. From the fantastic Saul Bass opening credits through to the final shot everything here is right. The only week point being Kim Novak who I do not think is that great an actor, but apart from that the only other part of any other size is Barbara Del Geddes who is very good as Madge. We have some almost psychedelic effects shots from Hitchock to add to the deepening sense of paranoia that culminates in a great suspenseful finale.

Superb!,"Let me start by saying that the twist is one of the most original, shocking and simply intelligent that I've ever seen on film. I was completely stunned when it was revealed, and I can only think of one or two other occasions of me being shocked remotely by a twist. Hitchcock has a rare ability to have the film run 15 full minutes with no dialogue, yet it remains just as/if not more engaging as any action filled bloodfest we see today. My eyes became completely glued to the screen as I became just as obsessed with discovering the truth behind the mystery as Scottie was. As Lynch does in Blue Velvet, Hitchcock uses the theme of voyeurism throughout yet instead of making it perverse and disgusting he somehow makes the act feel completely natural and almost comfortable; it's just like a second nature.The use of contra-zoom to display the sense of vertigo is absolutely astonishing. It perfectly depicts the sensation and even gives the viewer a sense of the illness whenever the technique is used. The performances are fantastic. Stewart is definitely at the top of his game, bringing us right into the character in what I consider the finest work of his career. Novak is even more incredible, delivering one of my all time favorite portrayals. She is completely immersed into her character and furthers the viewer's immersion into Scottie. We really feel the same emotions as he does throughout the entire picture. The ending is unbelievably abrupt, but that makes it all the more shocking and utterly cathartic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It is more than a psychological thriller, a drama or a ""colorful film noir"". Superb dialogues, a beautiful shot of San Francisco, which seems to be intentionally strange -and not the well-known american city- and, of course, Vertigo give us the best James Stewart and Kim Novak performances. There is no much to say about the score: the opening credits are not as easy to listen as ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"", and the fascinating ""scene d'Amore"" (where Stewart finally changes Novak into another Novak) is just a variation of ""Tristan und Isolde"" prelude (R.

The Ultimate San Francisco Movie,"My father took me to see Vertigo and I instantly LOVED this classic. It influenced me to settle in San Francisco, as it is indisputably the ultimate San Francisco movie, with Bullitt a very respectable second. I have personally visited almost every real location depicted in the movie, and I love to give my out of town visitors the Vertigo tour of the places that still exist. Vertigo is a great tour of some of the many beautiful spots in and around SF.I love Alfred Hitchcock films and though Rear Window is my favorite, I think Vertigo is his best and perhaps most personal. From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better.This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10/10 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock at his most unpredictable...,"Vertigo is the 6th film I have seen from Hitchcock, and it is among his best. Where Psycho's first half completely turned the tables in the second half, Vertigo goes to have a resolution midway through the film. Since I had no idea of what the plot would be, it made it a bigger treat to see the film unravel the way it did. At first, I was skeptical whether the film could reach the amount of fame it has, but once the film was over I got it. It is a fabulous written film with amazing set locations, great performances at it's core, and unpredictable story lines. At the end of it all it remains probably one of Hitchcock's most simple films, but It has an aura and tone that is distinctive to the rest of his films that I have seen. I look forward to rewatching this film and as of now it ranks up in the top half of his filmography, but I don't think it has quite achieved the same level as Psycho (so far).",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Intoxicating Film,"Visually magnificent film, with Hitchcock at his absoloute best. Herrmann contributes a mesmerising score, Stewart is outstanding as the ambiguous Scotty and Bel Geddes and Novak are fine. Everything gels perfectly here, with a very complex, fascinating script more than matched by the outstanding visual opulence. The colour, angles, zooms etc. used by Hitchcock perfectly capture the paranoia of the story.Vertigo gradually becomes more and more intoxicating as it progresses, and is an absolute work of art- certainly one of my top 10 greatest films ever list.Be sure to check this one out, it's a true cinematic classic. ***** (out of *****)",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock crafts a near perfect movie which is much more than a mystery,"""Vertigo"" is considered by some the greatest movie ever made, and while I find impossible to give that definition to any movie, I see why it's praised so much. To date I have watched three Hitchcock movies: ""Rebecca"", ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"". None of the three fulfilled my expectations: I see the modernity and sometimes brilliant solutions by the author, but they always felt overpraised to me. Maybe after ""Vertigo"" I'll have to watch them again and understand the depth I sensed in this one. Is it a mystery movie? Yes, but only on the surface. Like any masterpiece, this film has a number of levels of interpretation: the plain mystery, solved at 3/4 of the movie; Scottie's spiral into madness, man's need for control over life and death, the meaning of colour to address emotions. These are just a few examples of just how multifaceted ""Vertigo"" can be, evolving from the original script into a real work of art. This might very well be the best example to show how Hitchcock managed to craft popular movies with a (heavy!) authorial touch for those who can grasp it.I also loved James Stuart's performance from likableness, through catatonic depression into obsessive maniacal behaviour, and keeping a continuity in his character only the greatest actors can achieve. Kim Novak, just like every other Hitchcock girl, is not my favourite on screen, but can always get the right intensity and sex appeal necessary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Keeps You In Suspense!,"Vertigo is the first Alfred Hitchcock film I have experienced and that is one of the many reasons why the film will stick to my heart forever. I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses.Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine.We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era.Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""Vertigo"" ranks as one of Hitchcock's finest films, a real jewel.","Perfect is not a word used very often in the analysis of a motion picture, but in the case of 'Vertigo' the adjective seems appropriate. This film is amazing and its place in movie history as one of the best ever made is more than well deserved.This tale about tragic love, obsession, and murder is so well made that the sensation of watching it is almost hypnotic.Hitchcock's direction is flawless. He never fails in holding the viewer attention unfolding the story with unparallel intelligence and impressive skills. He masterfully creates a suspenseful atmosphere with an unsettling dark tone that leaves the viewer exhausted and highly satisfied.Kim Novak is impressive as the leading lady. She's sexy, mysterious, and vulnerable at the same time, giving the best remembered performance of her career.James Stewart as a retired police detective suffering from acrophobia is magnificent. Is hard to describe in words how good he is in this movie. At the beginning of the film he is a kind and practical person aware of his phobia and willing to cure it step by step, but as the story develops he turns into an obsessed man full of pain and guilt who desperately tries to reconstruct his shattered life. The actor makes the psychological transition of his character in such unforced and natural manner that is impossible not to believe him. This is an unforgettable performance.Alfred Hitchcock was the real deal, an outstanding director with unique vision that made extraordinary movies. It is hard to believe that 'The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' never gave him an Oscar for his directorial efforts. But awards are a minor thing when you look at his body of work and 'Vertigo' ranks as one his finest films, a real jewel.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Intense study of compulsions, deception and lust","Vertigo was not a massive hit upon its release, but it has since become a cornerstone movie, one of the most beloved movies of its director, Alfred Hitchcock, and is nowadays regarded as one of the best movies of all time, especially by critics.And it certainly is a masterful film, even by Hitchcock's standards. It's also a very complex movie, even for him. Like in Psycho, the midway point of the film turns the whole arrangement on its head, and from thereon out it's almost like a completely new film. It's not anything I've ever seen before and quite frankly it left me feeling conflicted. On one hand the sudden reveal is such an unconventional way to tell a story that I appreciate it for its novelty and uniqueness. On the other hand I cannot help but think whether the twist would have had more impact if it had been revealed in a more traditional way.This dilemma also plagued Hitchcock himself, who reportedly wanted to change the twist into a more traditional form, but the producers told him to keep it. And in the end I'm glad they did, because it is such a novelty.Aside from that the film has its usual assortment of Hitchcock goodies. Master-level technique, powerhouse actors, intense atmosphere, great music, engaging storytelling. The whole nine yards and the kitchen sink to boot.Hitchcock's best film? Personally I'd say Psycho is just a bit better, but this is surely in the upper echelons. Well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Really good but the greatest?,"So this is what some critics think is the best film of all time? Yes it was good but is it that great? That's the problem when a film is over-hyped. It's hard to live up to the reputation. Although it is dazzling to look at, especially the famous effect shot that everyone talks about, it seemed to drag in the middle. That said, I did really like it even if it felt too long. I think if it was made today, they'd shorten the script by about 30 minutes. Maybe I just have a short attention span. Despite my concerns, I still give the film a solid 7 out of 10 but have certainly enjoyed other Alfred Hitchcock films a lot more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""Masterpiece.....Hitchcock's Best Film, Kim Novak's Best Performance""","If this was the last copy of ""Vertigo"" on earth, I would go into a burning building to save it, without question.I first saw this film in original release in 1958, small town in the middle of Kansas. Blew my teenage mind away.And when the film company came to a town next door, in Salina, Kansas, with Kim Novak, to film ""Picnic"", I was in shock. In vertigo, when Novak shows, Stewart, her driver's license, it says, Salina, Kansas.""Vertigo"" just gets better each time I see it. And with the new restoration of the print and soundtrack, now on wide screen DVD, well thank goodness I lived to see this happen.""Gone with the Wind"" was the first film I ever saw.What's cute bit of trivia, Kim Novak and Jimmy Steward, finished ""Vertigo"" and within a few weeks, turned around and did ""Bell, Book, and Candle"" and the contrast is amusing, and would make an interesting double feature.Hitchcock and Novak felt it was their best film, ever. How wonderful for us.Bernard Hermann's haunting musical score, is responsible for this film being a masterpiece. I have studied Hermann's history and his opera, ""Wuthering Heights"".

A great suspenseful film,"Having seen Psycho I thought I had seen Hitchcock's best film. This film compares favourably. Vertigo has a great cast, Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak. Set in San Francisco with beautiful scenery, a plot unravels where you will be drawn in, and hooked to the conclusion. This is a suspenseful film from beginning to end.This is beautifully filmed, from the camera work, to the use of colour, and the film score adds greatly to the drama. This is a thrilling and clever film. The characters are whole and interesting, and Stewarts performance is compelling, and really marks him as one of the great actors. Kim Novak puts in a performance that is one of the best leads I've seen by a female actress.All round this is a wonderful, delightful film, with a in depth look at the human psyche, that has a strong resonance.Doesn't get a 10 because, i'm a film buff and very stingy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A movie that demands repeat viewing,"In the fifties, Jimmy Stewart made some movies that portrayed him in a not very flattering light.  The man that we saw normally playing the bumbling, shy yet great guy was now selfish, vindictive and had lost all faith in humanity.  These were great movies and his Scottie in ""Vertigo"" is one of the better examples of this.  Alfred Hitchcock weaves a tale that after watching makes the viewer feel uncomfortable with their feelings.  For we identify with Scottie and understand what he does and why we might have done it as well.  This is why I think another viewing would be beneficial because knowing all the secrets allows the viewer to watch the movie from a more objective point of view and see how twisted someone can become.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Wonderfully disturbing,"What a wonderful, creepy, beautiful, disturbing film this is. From the opening credits, Hitchcock makes us uneasy with spiraling patterns on the screen, which hints at the vertigo/acrophobia to follow, but what we find are so many other disturbances and twists of the mind: obsession, guilt, insanity, and manipulation. There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man. Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way). The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish. It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout. There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. Hitchcock's delving into dark places of the mind, his storytelling, and his camera angles, are all superlative. Excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"You'll feel like you've run a marathon.  This movie is ""exhausting"".","Hitchcock's masterpiece. This film was made before I was born but it's appeal is timeless enough to make it one of my top ten favorite movies.Kim Novak openly challenges Grace Kelly in the glamor stakes. Her facial expressions are riveting and clearly meet Hitch's requirement to make cinema audiences squirm uncomfortably in their seats. She is everything 50's woman was and should be. Jimmy Stewart shows why he was justifiably the icon of an age. For me, Hitch was always able to get more from Jimmy Stewart than other directors. Looking at Rear Window and The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart turns in a much better performance than in the countless westerns I've seen.Hitchcock has always messed with my head. Hitch led the way and other directors followed. There is a particular camera sequence in Vertigo when Madeleine (Kim Novak) runs up a spiral staircase and Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) follows. Special effects were somewhat limited in the 50's compared to today so Hitch used the spiral staircase and camera focus to convey the dizziness Scotty was feeling. Simple but effective. So effective in fact I've seen Spielberg use exactly this camera effect in one of his movies. Almost 50 years on and this work is still fresh.The script is well written and the atmosphere between Novak and Stewart can be cut with a knife. Everything tells the story - the script, the set, the costume and the physical interaction of the leads. There is an intense repressed passion about this movie. The cast sit on an emotional volcano that seems to be constantly on the verge of erupting.The classic Hitch-twist is a real surprise. Everything in your head tells you this could never be and Hitch takes you straight in that direction. There is a strange sense of voyeurism about the second part of this movie. It feels like you are seeing something that you really should not see. You are going into that small forbidden place that everyone keeps to themselves. That part that even husband and wife don't share. As a viewer that certainly makes me squirm uncomfortably in my seat, so I think Mr Hitchcock has achieved his objective.As a movie there are pieces that date and make it very obviously a 50's movie. However, the most important part, the plot the script and the relationship between the two protagonists - dress them in fashions for the 21st century and you could re-shoot this film today.What makes this movie so very special is the emotional roller-coaster ride Mr Hitchcock takes you on. The out-of-control speed and the wheels coming off at every turn and as you look to your left you see Hitch has turned into a squealing demon delighting in every second of your discomfort. You'll feel like you've run a marathon. This movie is ""exhausting"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Haunting masterpiece,"Let's get one thing straight right off the top:  This is one of the best films ever made (as if you haven't heard that enough reading these reviews). With that said, I'll say this.  I studied this film extensively in University, and I analyzed it in terms of gender/sexual power relations. There are, of course, some kinky elements to James Stewarts's obsession in this film.  What most people don't realize, is just how much that obsession is made explicit in the film, without the audience realizing. The more Scottie falls in love with (and becomes obsessed with) Madeleine, the more the real world falls away.  Literally, people start to dissapear. In the beginning, when Scottie is hired to follow her, she is seem with people (in traffic, in a flower shop).  As she becomes more and more the focus of Scottie's infatuation, the crowds of people thin out and dissapear altogether.  The museum of Art more closely resembles a tomb, as only Madeleine's and Scotties car are parked out front.  No one walks the halls of the gallery excepts Scottie, and a curator that Scottie summons for information (who only becpmes present because Scottie wants him to be there for that moment).  At San Fransisco Bay, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is just Scottie and Madeleine.  The colonial town up the coast where Madeleine takes her plunge is more of a ghost town, as there are no tourists, not a person in sight.  Just the two of them. In the redwood forest.  The two of them alone. It is too much of a stretch to assume that everyone in San Fransisco decided not to leave their homes that day.The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's directing is that he makes the camera see what Scottie sees.  He's tuning out and ignoring the other people around him, so he just sees Madeleine.  Thus, the camera only sees Madeleine, and no one else.  Thus, the city and the coast is left just to the two of them. Like Adam and Eve, only a tale of tragedy.  This 'fixation' of both the camera and the character is what gives the film its mysterious and dreamlike quality.  In a way, it's because Scottie is bewildered by Madeleine's mysterious manner, her dream-like qualities (her dream-girl qualities) that makes this film more than just a ghost story, more than a mystery or a thriller.  It's much more personal than a normal movie, and it is because the camera has become a character.  And that, my friends, is hard to pull off.  Which is why I hold Alfred Hitchcock so highly, and which is why you should give this film a second look, if you already haven't seen it once.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Where a dizzy plot and story leave this viewer behind...,"When I first saw this movie in 1959, I was bored to tears, almost. As a teenager, I wanted action, and the film and story seemed to be lacking in that regard. Only when Psycho (1960) came along did my appreciation of Hitchcock increase. As to Vertigo's story, the above short synopsis from filmfactsman provides sufficient information for those who haven't seen the movie.However, over fifty years later, I watched Vertigo for a second time and I must say my initial assessment was similar: the film's action drags with too much walking, shadowing and following, coupled with too much driving, following and shadowing. Appropriate jump-cutting could have been used a number of times – and shorten viewers' pains in the process, I think.On the flip side though, I can now fully appreciate Hitchcock's filming technique to show how Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) grapples with the mystery of Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) and how he unravels it. Though I'm sure there were more shot-reverse shot sequences in this movie than in any other of Hitchcock's.However, what the film truly lacks overall, in my opinion, is effective suspense – sufficient to keep this viewer fully interested in what will happen, and when and why. Hence, it's even a more of a puzzle to me why Vertigo has now replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as ""the best movie of all time"" (or words to that effect). Sure, both stories are mysteries, but the latter packs more of a punch for viewers from the get-go; and the revelation at the end provides greater dramatic irony than that in Vertigo. Indeed, one could argue that Vertigo's irony is weak, at best, and just corny at worst.Moreover, one wonders how a supposedly intelligent ex-cop could be so stupid to be sucked in twice by the same – but different – woman. Love is blind, I guess, as always.And, finally, the entire story of Vertigo is just too predictable, in addition to having a dialog that's just plain dull much of the time. Technically, as I implied, the actual filming is excellent, as you would expect from Hitchcock; and the color is just so vividly vibrant. But that's not enough for me to regard it as anything more than just that: a well-constructed film with few errors.James Stewart – always more effective in comedy and westerns, in my opinion – is just not right for the role. Kim Novak, on the other hand, is most effective, providing her best acting role that I've seen. And, as always, Barbara Bel Geddes is a most suitable supporting player as one of Stewart's old flames.I'm glad I've seen the movie again. And I do recommend it for all Hitchcock fans, for sure. But it's no where near his best effort: too long, too slow, too predictable and too light on suspense. Give this one six out of ten – and I'm being generous.January 2nd, 2013",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Vertigo,"In 2012, Sight and Sound dethroned Citizen Kane as the best film of all time, ending a 50-year reign as the top film. The film in which they named the best film, was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Made in 1958 starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; I was really looking forward to seeing what so many thought was a superior film to the god-like Citizen Kane masterpiece. Vertigo explores obsession and how deeply obsession can take root and the disastrous effects that can have on everyone involved. When a retired San Fransisco detective is asked to do a favor for a friend, and obsession takes root, lives are changed forever.John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective living in San Fransisco, has been forced to leave his job as a debilitating case of acrophobia, or, vertigo has taken control of him after being involved in a roof-top chase resulting in the death of a subject. Adjusting to a more low-key life, Scottie is spending a lot of time connecting with friends, such re-connections have led him to an old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin shares with Scottie that his wife has been exhibiting some odd behaviors, in which she has episodes in which she seems to believe that she is the reincarnation of a deceased ancestor. Gavin explains that she experiences these episodes, then abruptly comes out of them, never remembering what she experienced while she was enduring the episode. Gavin asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) as he is concerned for her sanity. Scottie obliges, and as he begins to follow her, he gets to know her and almost instantly falls in love with her. Scottie doesn't just fall in love with Madeleine, though, he becomes deeply obsessed with her. After saving her life several times from her attempted suicides, Scottie is unable to save her when she climbs to the top of a bell tower she intends to jump from, due to his vertigo. After several months of brooding after his obsession, Scottie feels magnetically drawn to a woman who looks just like Madeleine and takes her shopping and to die her hair so she may look identical to his obsession. Scottie was making a woman in Madeleine's image until he realizes he has been duped by an intricate puzzle he has unknowingly been a part of.I'm a sucker for openings and movie introductions. Vertigo opens in a brilliant way with an equally as brilliant introduction to Kim Novak as the stunning beauty that kidnaps the eye in the restaurant scene. The colors in this film are fantastic and all of Hitchcock's trials with color come to wonderful fruition with Vertigo. A psychological thriller to end all thrillers, Vertigo is a wonderfully intricate puzzle which is a superb treat for the audience to piece together. Technically, Vertigo is a film to study by anyone interesting in filmmaking or understanding films on a deeper plane and artistic level. The shot composition is divine in Vertigo, creating a work of art in each scene. I am quite partial to Jimmy Stewart and thought he did a wonderful job in the complex role of Scottie. One thing that has always struck me about Vertigo was how unfairly blamed Stewart was for the failure of the film. Vertigo was not commercially or critically successful upon its release, and he shouldered much of this blame on Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock and Stewart had worked together three times previously, and their fourth film, Vertigo would be their last because Hitch thought someone like another stock actor of his, Cary Grant, would have brought more sex appeal to the role and producing a better final product. Unfortunately, Hitch seems to miss all that Stewart brings to the role, the deliberate motions, and movements that Grant would have faltered with. In any regard, Vertigo has etched a place in history and for just cause as a true illustration of Hitchcock's mastery.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Brilliant Piece of Filmmaking!,"Vertigo is by far Hitchcock's masterpiece (some will argue Psycho is, but Vertigo is real technical genius).  Telling the story of an obsessed ex-cop (Stewart), Hitchcock weaves a tangled web of suspense, inner conflict, and the supernatural. Of all Hitchcock's films, this one is said to be the most personal, as it regards Hitch's fascination with women and the traits of actresses. Bernard Herrman's score is one of his bests.  Incorporating a dizzying series of notes in the string section- musically achieving the effect of vertigo.  Later, Herrman brings out his lush, romantic melodies, with beautiful tones, but always with an underlying harmony of doom. Perhaps featuring one of the best scenes in all of film history-Hitch lets his brilliance of camera work, knowledge of Herrman's musical abilities, and the actor's/actress's skill, capture us in a moment in time never to be forgotten.

The Obsessive Power of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo,"Synopsis: A retired detective (James Stewart) with vertigo spies on and becomes obsessed with an old acquaintance's wife (Kim Novak) whom the husband feels is possessed by one of her dead relatives.Review: Vertigo was a personal project for director Alfred Hitchcock; arguably his most personal work. Vertigo is more than a brilliant suspense film; at its heart it is a story about obsession and the struggle to let go.James Stewart gives one of the great performances in the history of cinema with his dark portrayal of Scottie, an obsessed detective with a fear of heights. Kim Novak is also excellent as Madeleine, the woman at the center of Scottie's obsession. Hitchcock, with his pristine craft, utilizes his directorial abilities by using camera-techniques, fog filters, beautiful and rich colors, mirrors, and Bernard Herrmann's haunting musical score to help the audience journey into the mind of Scottie as well as to accentuate Scottie's journey into the depths of his obsession.Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever made and it is the ultimate testament to Hitchcock's brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Pretentious miss,"Despite it's elevated status, which has come from criticism and academic analysis, Vertigo remains a boring experience, even with many interesting thematic facets.Hitchcock told Truffaut that the interest/suspense in Vertigo is what Scottie might do. That question had been the bedrock of Hitchcock's cinema but Scottie as played by Stewart is too ambiguous; he is reactive and weak. The lack of vigor in the character makes his falling love with with Madeleine barely believable, and his constant pleading with her is altogether too weak.Compounding the problems is the plot, the structural mechanism, of the story that is also not believable. The orchestration of the scheme requires credibility and here it is strained: the choice of policeman; the discovery of Judy etc it's rather like those English mysteries that Raymond Chandler mocked because it is contingent on rare elements to bind the entire piece together.And Novak's performance, which despite a reappraisal recently, seems to demonstrate that she never really progressed beyond the nervous rabbit role play at drama school. She is , as the expression has it, wise with a closed mouth, but once she speaks the mystery is gone. Her eyebrows are also quite frightening.Vertigo has great music, locations and an intriguing idea for a story (one that would have been gripping in a novel); but equally it has dull driving scenes, over written dialog (Pop's story in the bookstore) and two lead actors who are far from ideal. This is one film when the themes and not the material on screen excites comment, and more film Phds no doubt, but it is pretentious miss in Hitchcock's golden decade.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Stewert and Novak, - Heavenly Pair","This movie is - simply put a masterpiece. Not too many movies can envelop the watcher in a dizzying array of emotions the way Vertigo can. Loss and obsession, peppered with stretches of unrestrained bliss come to mind. But aside from the carefully woven plot line, its the little nuances of this film that really grab hold of you.There is much debate between this film and Rear window as to which film is visually superior. What makes rear window stunning is the camera work and the set of course. But rear window is confined to a single set, and makes the possibilities limited. Which leads to my point. Vertigo's cinematography is beautiful enough to entice even the most icy of viewers. This film invokes more emotion than any other film I've seen before - and this cannot be attributed entirely to the plot line, but the visual style with which it was filmed. From the sweeping camera over San Francisco, to Kim Novak's face against the red plush background of Ernie's interior, to the overhead shot of the stairs and hallway in the hotel, to the ethereal shot of the Golden Gate bridge, the placements and angles of the camera are flawless. Obviously Hitchcocks visions came alive in this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Here's to Love on Our Own Terms,"I feel a need to tell you a short anecdote about seeing this movie. When it was restored in the late 1990s, the New York premiere took place at the Ziegfeld. I managed to wangle my way in and saw so much in this movie I hadn't seen before, that can't really be seen except on the big screen.... and when I left the theater, I saw couples coming out..... and three or four women slapped the men they were with.Now it seemed to me clear that they felt that they had undergone some of the transformations imposed on the Kim Novak character by the Jimmy Stewart character for the sake of their relationships and bitterly resented it.... but it seemed to me that Stewart was also transformed by the relationship. In fact, he was destroyed by the relationship.... and was his acquiescence at all voluntary? Yet people do not see the sacrifices that others make for love, they only see their own, and they regret them bitterly.... and that, it seems to me, is that what this movie is about: the forces and twists and turns, the ignoring the clear signs, the self destruction at so many levels that love drives us to. This cynical, manipulative movie about absolute love.Three or four big, hairy men slapped by women. And taking it.

I remembered the story line and the disorienting experience, and how captivated I was by the mystery story for years. I remember that we had to leave my aunt and uncle's home before the final twist of the film was revealed--and I made my aunt promise to watch the film and let me know how it ended. Well, she obviously didn't see the film, as I called her up when we got home, and she told me that the man and woman fell in love and the movie ended with them nice and happy!! So for 30 years, that's how I thought Vertigo ended. Then in the early 1980's I saw the film in its famous re-release as it was garnering its new found critical and commercial acclaim, in all its glorious color, with a New York City audience laughing and clapping and getting so amazingly caught up in this grand cinematic experience. It was, simply put, awesome!There are scenes in this film that are so unique, so surprising , that they genuinely take the breath away. The two shots of Madeleine, as a beautiful goddess-like figure in Ernie's restaurant, viewed from Scotty's perspective in the distance, then up-close as she glides by as if in a dream; the shot of Madeleine reappearing after Scottie's initially humorous, but then uncomfortably obsessive make-over, filmed in a glowing, hazy light, with Bernard Herrmann's ravishing film score welling up in waves of sonorous passion; the surprisingly long sequence without almost any dialog in which Scotty trails Madeleine, containing one gorgeous moment after another - the back-door opening up onto the kaleidoscopic colors of the flower shop, the mysterious silence in the grandeur of the museum; the gorgeous views of San Francisco - the monuments, the colors, the vistas; the truly dreamlike scene in the middle of the towering, dark redwoods; and that vision of the Golden Gate Bridge where Scotty ""saves"" Madeleine - it took truly masterful film-making to take an iconic American image, and present it on screen in such a spectacular and unique manner.But the film is not merely a ""museum film"" where art direction and cinematography are the most important element. In Vertigo, the story is a ""page turner"". We are watching each of the characters, absolutely fascinated with the twists and turns that abound. The engaging humor, the riveting suspense, the intriguing story line all stem from the manner in which Hitchcock presents the three main characters: - the physically and psychically crippled hero of James Stewart, the enigmatic, but unbelievably alluring heroine of Kim Novak, and the adorable, humorous, lively, human and humane Barbara Bel Geddes - we care deeply for all three of them, tangled in this complex spiral of inevitable sadness and tragedy.I loved the film having seen only 2/3rds of it as a kid, and I now know this film as a great and enduring piece of American Cinema, a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Best Movie Ever!!!,"This is the best movie ever, with more depth than I have ever seen. In 2003, I flew from New York to San Francisco just to see the sights in the movie.Scottie's (Jimmy Stewart's) apartment is located at 900 Lombard Street (corner of Jones), one block downhill from the famous crooked street. The door is no longer red, but the doorbell and mailbox are still in the same place. The bushes have definitely grown! Seeing this apartment gave me chills. You would recognize it even if you didn't have the address.Coit Tower can be seen from the apartment as in the movie.Madeline's (Kim Novak's) apartment is located at 1000 Mason Street. It looks the same.The Misson San Juan Bautista is 100 miles south of San Francisco. It was creepy. There is not a bell tower there. The eucalyptus trees that Scotty and Madeline drove through (the divided highway) to get there is actually a few minutes south of San Juan Bautista. Therefore, they would not have passed through that area on their way from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista.A person at Mission Deloris showed me where the headstone was located in the movie. It was eerie.I had a picture of me taken at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, sitting on the bench where Kim Novak sat. Also, they have a great Vertigo scrapbook for visitors to look at.Scotty and Judy walked outside of the Palace of Fine Arts. It looked the same.Muir Woods looked the exact same. The sign that Madeline pointed to and said ""This is when I was born. This is when I died"" is there. The steep mountain to get there is real.Fort Point does not have the steps that were shown in the movie.Ernie's restaurant is no longer there.What a trip!

Hitchcock's haunting study of human obsession,"Vertigo is a masterpiece. There is no denying that. The entire film is as dizzying to watch as the fear that it tackles, from the whirling opening credits by Saul Bass to the deeply haunting romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. When I first watched 'Vertigo', I will admit that I didn't like it. I was expecting a typical thriller like so many others, such as Psycho and North By Northwest. This film is much deeper, and is very complex psychologically. Stewart gives a terrifying performance of a man stumbling deeper and deeper into a dream world of obsession, and Hitchcock's use of color is extraordinary, and this is shown in a surreal dream sequence that is more terrifying than any other. What is most startling about 'Vertigo' is its genuine emotion throughout. It is not to be classified as a traditional 'happy entertainment' film. So do watch this, and be bowled over by its genius, but you might need a stiff drink afterward.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's lost masterpiece,"This movie is really great!  At the time of it's release, it was considered a disappointment, but now it's considered one of Hitchcock's finest.  I also think it's one of Jimmy Stewart's best performance, and is acting is incredible, especially at the end in the tower.  He starts shaking Madeline (Kim Novak) because he's so angry.  I think that part is very unlike Stewart, who usually played the nice guy who never lost his temper.  I also think the performance by Kim Novak is brilliant.  She was known as more of a sexy leading lady without really dramatic parts.  But in this, she really shows her ability to use her beauty to fool a man, and drive him to near insanity.""Vertigo"" is a wonderful movie, with a beautiful score.  Any Alfred Hitchcock fan really needs to see this, which many consider today to be his ""lost masterpiece"".",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Visually stunning, nothing more than that","Heard a lot about this film. After watching it, I can say the film 'looks good' but isnothing great. Good looks here means in terms of Cinematograpy, use of Colour, subtle changes in black and bright shades, set decoration etc.For all of those who are saying this is a supsence thriller, sorry but it's not. Atleast, in the second half. It can be considered an unusual obsession story. Logic can be overlooked while watching it.Story :- Gavin hires Scottie, an ex detective to spy his wife to know if she is poccesed by a spirit. Now, there are only two possiblities -either she is poccesed or she is pretending to be. That's why I said there's not much of a suspence. Most of the suspence comes through music only. With almost forty minutes of running time left, whole story is revealed .Now Hitchcock is a smart director, he did not try it make look smart by putting another twist but immediately changed the story from there. Now it becomes an obsession story, but story after that is not all that interesting.Overall, the fil did not impress me much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Sensation of Vertigo is hard to overcome, really a masterpiece!","This movie is a trademark specialty of Hitchcock. Again his movie hero (Jimmy Stewart) is not a normal person but is haunted by height phobia and is about to enter into the most bizarre experience of his life. As the name suggest the movie throttles your mind at its best. Due to nature of the script the movie is slow tempered from the first half but its sure that it will mesmerizes you. The most significant aspect of the movie is that it keeps you continuously in the whirlpool of tension and ambiguity .You never know how the movie will end and this is the best part! Jimmy Stewart is once more very much convincing and Kim Novak also delivers her best performance, and no words to adjudicate Alfred Hitchcock's immaculate direction .The movie is 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Shock Time,"This may come as a shock to some people reading this, but I'm quite a big Hitchcock fan and ""Vertigo,"" in my opinion, is not his best film. ""Rear Window"" is the finest feature he ever made, and ""Psycho"" was his most purely entertaining (although I would rank the famous horror film third, after ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"").James Stewart plays a private detective who is hired to follow a beautiful blond (Kim Novak) whom he quickly falls in love with. She commit suicide (or did she?) and, later on in the film, the Stewart character finds the glowing image of her in an equally beautiful redhead. I won't give away anything else.Now don't get me wrong, ""Vertigo"" is a near-excellent film that I love and cherish. Most ""Vertigo"" detractors say the film can be seen from too many different points of views  (surreal dream, detective story, romance, etc.) and that is has no clear narrative flow. Actually, I like that aspect of the movie. My problem with ""Vertigo"" is a more primitive one; I just think the buildup to the blond's suicide is too long and worked up. ""Vertigo"" may be a near-great movie, but it's not one I could watch over and over again. Not Rated. 128 minutes. 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
This movie is great.,"This movie features incredibly powerful acting by the two stars, James Stewart and Kim Novak. In fact, this story is so actor-driven that it is unlikely that with different actors the movie would have been as nearly as powerful. Stewart plays a character, Scotty, who is being cruelly manipulated by two people for ulterior purposes that become apparent only later in the movie. What drives the story forward is the interaction between Scotty and the woman, Madeleine, whose deviousness is only matched by her own emotional vulnerability. Emotions become confused as victim and manipulator become more involved. Besides being arguably James Stewart's most emotionally evocative performance, it propels the movie to a dramatic crescendo that is completely engaging. It is virtually impossible for an audience not to empathize with Scotty's emotional torment. Yet, what makes the movie even more provocative is the way in which the two characters are portrayed - as people with whom one can identify. Scotty and Madeleine are plausible characters. Without going into detail, suffice it that Kim Novak gives the best performance of her career. The cinematography is excellent. This is a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Judy.,"No superlatives.  VERTIGO turns in one itself.  Yes it's 'about' cinema, about the male spectator especially, about the self-destructive passivity of active desire.  Like 'The Great Gatsby', its corresponding text in literature, VERTIGO  is about illusory lives, dreams, and the unattainable girl.  But VERTIGO complicates this.  VERTIGO is not told only from the point of view of Scottie, or the omniscient 'narrator'/director who subtly undermines him.  VERTIGO, unlike 'Gatsby', or 'Lolita', gives its heroine a voice.  We are allowed to see what she sees and thinks.  Scenes are coloured by her emotion, just as they are for Scottie.  See how they both visualise Ernie's, for example: Scottie's expansive, enquiring, free point of view and Judy's broken, Sirkian, experience, foregounding intruding decor and different levels, like shattered fragments.VERTIGO is Judy's tragedy - Scottie is actually offered a woman who will love him early, who will humiliate, negate, even kill herself for him; Judy loves someone who doesn't even know she exists.  But her Scottie doesn't exist either - like Heathcliff awaiting his Cathy, he is in another realm. Her cramped ordinary room for her is a suitcase, a wardrobe, a wallet, photos; for Scottie it is a magical, fairy-tale, substance-less cave, where once again time collapses, and talk of 'three years' is irrelevant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A minor correction,"I just read an incorrect comment on this movie.Andrew 162 remarked about the ""shape of the church tower"" and referred to its location as San Francisco.  In fact, that adobe building, is Mission San Juan Bautista, which is about 100 miles south of San Francisco off Hwy 101. The Coroner's Jury scene is also filmed in the same town, in one of the historic buildings there.  Mission San Juan is one of the original California missions, and is the oldest continuously operating church in the state.The bell tower in the movie was a set constructed by Hitchcock, there was no bell tower there at the time, but there is one there now, which was constructed since.Lastly, the scene in the automobile in which they are ""driving down"" to San Juan Bautista, the divided highway with the eucalyptus trees, is actually still there, but it is located south of San Juan Bautista on the way to Salinas, so they would not have passed that stretch of highway between San Francisco and San Juan Bautista.Maybe this is ""too much information,"" but I had to get it out there.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Far greater than you might have expected!,"Who says exposure of mystery or not is the key to distinguish Thriller and Mystery? In fact, I felt them both in this movie! As plot goes by, I discovered the truth with protagonist. Then at the end it caught my breath. I was wondering what he would do and what could possibly happen.I've been always unwilling to watch movies in old days, thinking they are old and might be unacceptable. To be specific, the cinematography is absolutely not as beautiful as today, and the edit is now like today's style — fast-pacing. So many times I chose to watch some ordinary ones in current age instead of some classic ones in old days. But that's so wrong! As time goes by and technology develops, what's left for the next generation would always be the best. Those average- quality ones would simply be replaced by the best. So for now, most of the movies would be regarded as trash maybe in hundreds of years later. Then why waste time watching them if I'm not enjoying them?So, only look for those movies which can make you enjoy - the fantastic story the movie tells - the way the director represents the story - the work of editor and cinematographer that makes it an art - the great performance of those actor and actressBack to this movie, the reasons I love it stated below. Its dialogue is designed so natural. I don't know whether it is just the style they talked in 50's or not. For me, overall, it looks natural. And the other thing is they keep connecting to the next topic they wanna talk about or the next plot that's gonna happen. And it is so fluent.Actress is so beautiful. I've always heard that in Hitchcock's movies, actress would always be beautiful blonds. Haven't got a chance to see that. We'll see.The editing and filming is actually far better than I expected, since you know it's a 1958 movie..In a word, it is so great! And now I get to understand why people would talk about Hitchcock's movies a lot and regard him as one of the greatest directors in film history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A movie that got me spinning but lost my interest.,"Vertigo is one of those movies you apparently must have seen.Well, after watching the movie I was a bit disappointed. The movie is overall a really solid movie and you can certainly se Hitchcocks creativity when it comes to placing, moving and operating the camera. While camera is much, the thing i find most important in a movie is its story, but this time the story was probably the biggest letdown of the movie. The pacing is okay and probably what you expect to se in older movies, it takes time to build the characters and it is done threw creative ways of expressing it in dialogue and not just putting it out into the air unnaturally. What I believe looses the viewer is the fact that after the second plot point we don't really have anything to grab onto, let me explain. After the plot point and in the start of act three we feel completely lost, is the movie over? Was this the climax? It sure did not feel like a climax but you get the point. Without anything to grab onto and not really knowing where the story is heading you are in some way put into the shoes of our protagonist, really feeling like all is lost. As a viewer this makes things complicated, you surely don't want to turn the movie of because you know there is something to come, but the light in the tunnel is just far far to far away and you end up loosing the interest of proceeding the film.While most of the movie is spent in the shadows there is few moments for the viewer to build a connection to the main characters and when we after all get a conversation we are not really put into the shoes of the characters. In the end it is almost like we are left wondering who these people really are, we don't really care for them and that is probably why the climax feels a bit weak.Anyhow, not to dwell too deep on vertigo for to long, I am preparing to watch north by northwest and surely hope the fear of heights won't stick with me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Awful garbage,"The use of colour is probably the only good thing about this slow and boring, overlong, dated film. The first half is much too long and slow and the repetitive driving scenes quickly become very tiresome. Kim Novak was always a poor actress, and looks ridiculous with her bleached platinum blond hair and thick dark eyebrows. Far too many scenes take place in the studio on very fake looking sets with painted backdrops. The opening scene is ruined because it is so fake, not that cops would be chasing a criminal over rooftops anyway. By far the worst thing however is the dreadful miscasting of Grandfather Stewart as Scottie. Stewart was clearly far too old to be playing romantic leads at this point in his career and he was actually more than twice Kim Novak's age (she was 24 and he was 49, though he looked at least 55). His grey wig is laughably bad and he just looks like an ugly old man chasing after his granddaughter. With a younger, better looking actor like Marlon Brando the film might have at least been watchable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Self-revelation.,"VERTIGO reveals itself three times during the film - it encapusulates itself, shows us what will happen before it happens, future and past in the present - it interprets the future, but we only know once our experience (watching the film) is past.  The opening credits - lips, James Stewart; eyes, Kim Novak, into the eyes of woman, not as fleshly human being, but man-made illusion - vast, black, abyss, geometrical patterns which only repeat, visualising the labyrinth, the white pattern that looks like a shroud, the changing colours like Scottie's dream.The opening sequence.  Scottie chases criminal over San Francisco rooftops at night.  Scottie follows, criminal escapes, 'innocent' falls to death. Scottie, even when most in control, following someone else, being driven by himself.  Scottie follows Maddie the night after he rescues her, through the same old San Francisco streets, baffled.  She leads him to his own house, to himself.  Scottie, after he has made up Judy into Maddie, the circular kiss, the anxiety, the stable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Hitchcock Masterpiece,"As much ""art"" film as Hollywood product, VERTIGO was generally savaged by critics upon its release; today it is widely regarded as Hitchcock's single finest film. The story is extremely well known: a retired police detective with an incapacitating fear of heights, Scottie, is engaged to shadow a beautiful woman, Madeline, whose husband suspects her of being suicidal. Scottie soon becomes obsessive about Madeline--but circumstances quickly spin out of control, and his love turns to tragedy and madness.Unlike most Hitchcock films, VERTIGO unfolds slowly, drawing the viewer into the relationship between Scottie and Madeline at the same pace as the characters experience it. At the same time, Hitchcock presents the viewer with a number of visual motifs (such as the famous spirals found in the film) to reinforce the increasingly disturbed nature of the story. As the film progresses, VERTIGO develops a powerfully hypnotic quality rather like the dreamed nightmare of a slow-motion fall.To a certain extent, the stars of VERTIGO are cast against type. This is particularly true of James Stewart, who is best known as the All-American Everyman, and his performance as the increasingly neurotic Scottie is all the more disturbing for our knowledge of his more typical performances. Although usually noted more for beauty than for acting ability, Kim Novack gives a remarkable and extremely believable turn in what is easily the finest performance of her career. The supporting cast--which includes particularly fine performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and Konstantin Shayne--is also excellent, and Bernard Hermann's excellent score adds tremendous dimension to the film.Some viewers, particularly those enamoured of such rapid-fire Hitchcock romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, may find themselves impatient with the film's leisurely pace; some viewers will themselves unable to see beyond the twists in the script to grasp Hitchcock's statement on obsessive love. But for most viewers--myself included--this is ""the"" Hitchcock film, the great masterpiece by a director renowned for masterpieces. A personal favorite, and very highly recommended.Gary F.

The Best Hitchcock Movie,"Those who are not sure of cinema-goers say that the best film Hitchcok is Psychosis.

Each plane and angle of the film is a delight to the eye of the viewer. Since planes that make long-shot look to the city of San Francisco as well as close-ups that until can make us feel on the skin of the protagonists.And in this case, Kim Novak and James Stwart are wonderful. It is the only film I've seen of this woman but I think it will enough. The chemistry that makes with Stwart is the best I've seen in my life. Although I believe the actions of James is millimeters below that Rear Window, the feeling of love that prints Novak into his character makes it unforgettable and unrivaled.But besides the fantastic direction of Hitchcok (as always, but this time is perfect), a dash with a perfectly structured and Finale of the best of all time makes this work the best his filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Hitchcock brings his patented brand of mystery to San Francisco.,"""Go up the stairs. Go up the stairs, Judy, and I'll follow.""How far, how deep into obsession can love for a woman drive a man? That's the very question that Alfred Hitchcock tackles in this twisty thriller.Having little knowledge of the plot of Vertigo is even more necessary than the average Hitchcock movie, so I'll reveal as little as possible. Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who is convinced by an old friend to secretly follow his wife (Kim Novak), who has been acting strangely. What comes next is a completely unpredictable and dark tale of love, death, deceit, and obsession.The only thing that keeps Vertigo from being amongst my favorite Hitchcock movies is its uneven quality. The tone of the first half of the movie is quite different from the second half, and while that makes complete sense within the context of the story, I found the latter portion to be much more entertaining, as a result. The ending ranks right there with Notorious and The Birds as the most memorable that Alfred ever did.This was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and in hindsight, it was a great one to begin with.

"Fine, but over-hyped","As with many such films, this one starts out with a very intriguing premise which tension only builds up as the elements of the plot flourish more and more towards the middle of the development... before stalling some during the last third of the film, somewhat toning down the fine quality of the early viewing. This film is too long for its own good, and has a bit of a rare 'symptom' of peaking too soon. It seems all the pressure fomented in the first hour is already resolved well before the final act of the film, and although there is certainly matter to the second half of the story, a lot of the essential atmosphere and purpose the film was subtly weaving for a while are put to sleep before a different kind of tone or 'color' (*wink wink*) completely takes over - one that is much more obvious, ordinary, maybe somewhat tedious. The first half is so mysterious, intimate, smooth, suspenseful, hauntingly romantic... and all this is traded away for a more conventional affair. Finally, the very title of the film seems a little misleading if not a lot, especially given this is a Hitchcock, where one would really expect something different and isn't necessarily given a worthy compensation for it. Overall, it's a fine film, but weaker in some respects than it seems it is given credit for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful but vastly overrated,"Vertigo has all the makings of a masterpiece except one: a compelling story. The twist is blatantly obvious twenty minutes into the film, and the romance of the film falls completely flat, so to speak.  Ultimately, for all of Hitchcock's vibrant colors, striking camera angles, and the thrilling dream sequence, we simply do not care whether the characters live or die. Overall, a very disappointing film, but worth watching nevertheless for fans of Hitchcock's work.

Hitchcock Strikes Again,"""Vertigo"" is perhaps Hitchcock's most twisted film, but it is also one of his best, as well as one of the best films ever made. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect. I won't disclose plot details here so as not to spoil anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but I will say the following.The casting in ""Vertigo"" could have failed miserable had it not been done in such a careful manner. Jimmy Stewart is probably the most likable actor in film history, which makes him the only person in the world who could have played the main role in this film without repulsing the audience. He keeps the main role of Scotty afloat for the entire film when no other actor could've done the same with such a twisted role. The same could be said of Kim Novak, who portrays the leading lady perfectly, managing to appear devious and sympathetic in alternating frames. Still, my favorite performance of the film is that of the role of Midge. Barbare plays this desperate friend of Scotty's in such a sympathetic way that we almost want Scotty to run off and marry her, even if it means ruining the film.""Vertigo"" is a well-made film all around. The cinematography is creepy and enchanting, as is the beautifully composed script. Of course, the real star of the film id=s the classic Bernard Hermann score, which is one of his best, probably second only to the score for ""Psycho."" In ""Vertigo,"" Hitchcock masterfully proves that he is not solely a murder mystery director, and that he can create suspense even in a love affair between two deeply troubled characters. It's twisted, certainly, but it has to be. It's a fantastic film and one of the master's best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"For me, the perfect Hitchcock film","I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons for a long time,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the greatest suspense films ever made. The director was at the top of his form with this work, which highlights intimate obsession bordering on necrophilia, which is a theme unusual in the time and place this movie was produced ( a U.S. studio in the late 1950s),but also Hitchock's amazingly ghoulish humor.Scotty Fergusen (Jimmy Stewart) is a private investigator who is recently retired from the city police force over an incident on the job that resulted in the death of a colleague and a pronounced fear of heights in Fergusen. Scotty is financially independent and has some support in the friendship of his confidant and former fiancé' Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). His life and what's left of his emotional stability begin to be challenged when he is contracted by wealthy shipping magnate Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) to track the doings of his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who has developed an obsession with the history of a tragic ancestor that now borders on the fantastic and suicidal. Or so Scotty is led to believe. What follows from the investigation is a star-crossed romance which assumes a surreal and sometimes folkloric dimension from the get-go, and which culminates in a post-mortem fantasy that will immolate not only Scotty, but the fortunes of working girl Judy Barton (Kim Novak in an interesting role within a role).If you've not seen this film, I will only tell you that Hitchcock demonstrates the truth of his masterful reputation as a movie maker through a precipitous wrap-up that left me crying I was laughing so hard, but I'm pretty twisted. All I'm going tell you is that I can't believe he got away with that back in 1958, and that in whatever realm the creatures of imagination reside, Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons to play with for a long time.By far and away, this one easily rates for me as one of the best films overall ever made, and if you like classic suspense film from the greats, this is one you can't miss.

The film tells the story of a Vertigo sufferer and police detective, John Ferguson, who believes that his newly found girlfriend is a reincarnation of a possessed woman who he saw commit suicide in the San Francisco Bay, after being assigned to investigate what was wrong with her. Both women are portrayed by Novak.It was premiered in the San Sebastian International Film Festival on May 8, 1958, where it was received poorly, polarising both critics and commercial audiences. However, as the film aged, it has become one of the most recognised, acclaimed American films ever made. In 1989, Vertigo was recognised as a ""culturally, historically and aesthetically significant"" film by the National Film Registry and subsequently restored internationally in 1996.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Just can't get past the beginning of this mivie,"A haunting movie with brilliant and beautiful cinematography. I have watched this movie many times, mainly because Kim Novak is so elegantly beautiful in her role. However, I can't get over the beginning where when James Stewart is chasing a perp across the rooftops of San Francisco, he slips and is left dangling precariously from a rain gutter. Subsequently, the police officer backing up Stewart's chase unsuccessfully tries to save him and falls to his death, leaving James hanging. I've always wanted to know how in the hell Stewart got off that roof. There is too much suspension of belief involved. That and the later scenes between Novak and Stewart require the viewer to abandon all logic and fling themself down a Hitchcockian rabbit hole. I've often heard Vertigo has stood the test of time well and is now regarded as one of the greatest films ever. To me, however, it has many great features but continuity and a logical progression are missing and makes me far less generous in my evaluation of what is still a very intriguing bit of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I Lost my Balance in San Francisco,"Detective Scotty Elster (James Stewart), recuperating from a traumatic vertigo event is contacted by an old acquaintance, Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) and hired to tail his disturbed wife Madeline (Kim Novak) to get at the root cause of the malady. She follows a routine daily by driving her ostentatious Rolls Royce about San Francisco and visiting a museum when one day she decides to toss herself into San Francisco Bay. Elster rescues her and the two draw close but she remains guarded.Vertigo's greatest mystery to me is its late rise in prominence over the decades where Sight and Sound called it the finest film in history in a critics poll. In my opinion it is not even the best of his output during the 50s. Stewart as vulnerable failure is more than adequate but Novak comes across bland and unemotive. The plot overall is a touch improbable and there's a hint Hitch paints himself into a corner by utilizing flashback rather than tie matters up at the end of the picture.Similar in many ways to Chinatown (74) and directed by Hitchcock acolyte, Roman Polanski, I find Vertigo the inferior work in which the student's work outclasses the master's in nearly everyway.

A Thriller for Today,"Vertigo is one of the perfect examples of a film that will always stand the test of time and one that should never be remade. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius and has many excellent films under attached to his resume. Psycho is the one synonymous with his name but Vertigo is arguably his best directed piece.Scottie Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) is a retired detective who dwells over a failed case. An old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), goes to Scottie and asks him to investigate his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), who he thinks is cheating on him. Scottie accepts with the hope this will allow him to put the past to rest, but it turns into a twisted obsession that engulfs him.This film was glossed over at the Academy Awards in 1959. But today the film will always stick out for its directing, the superb screenplay, and the amazing performance of Jimmy Stewart. These factors make this film a classic and give it top shelf status even still, today.Vertigo sets the bar for a lot of thrillers today and many directors and writers have taken lessons and paid homage to this film. If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything about it. Go into the movie and get lost in where the story takes you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's exquisitely mysterious masterpiece.,"Vertigo (1958)Number 1 - 1958Top 5 - 1950sTop 100 - All TimeVertigo displays Sir Alfred Hitchcock's mastery to frighten, surprise and tantalise at its highest level - this is a triumph not only in its genre but as a cinematic landmark in creative, modern cinematic attitudes.Of course, like most of Hitchcock's films,Vertigo, upon its release it was met with mixed reviews.Variety magazine said said the film showed Hitchcock's ""mastery"", but was too long and slow for ""what is basically only a psychological murder mystery"". However as time passed, Vertigo was met with vigorous excitement and favourability and has since become a classic, analysed and re-analysed so many times.The story of an acrophobic detective (James Stewart), who retires from the force and is later hired by a wealthy businessman to observe his wife's bizarre behaviour, claiming that she might be possessed. However, the truth is far from that as John 'Scottie' Ferguson realises as time passes and in true Hitchcockian fashion, the ride is thrilling from start to finish.Cinematic excellence, one of Hitchcock's finest films, highly recommended.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Genius on film,"First off, Great movie but I still think that North by Northwest was better (mostly because of the comical elements in it). The plot structure was set up in a way that can only be referred to as Hitchcock. The movie was split into two three act stories divided by the death of Madeleine. Particularly interesting was the fact that these two stories mirror each other and both end with a death in the convent. Hitchcock has a way of creating suspenseful situations that many modern film makers attempt to reproduce. I love the end when Jimmy Stewart's character is getting more and more irate when suddenly a dark figure appears in the doorway and scares Madeleine. Who knew that nuns could be so freaky. Also, Hitchcock blended elements of French Impressionism and Classic Hollywood styles together to create a simply genius film that I would recommend to everyone.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"I found it good, not great.","Since it's always cited as one of Hitchcock's best I had to give it a try since I thoroughly enjoyed my recent experience watching Rear Window. But I have to say I found Vertigo to be quite inferior to be honest. Mostly, unlike Rear Window and other classic movies that stand the test of time, Vertigo really feels like a product of its time, from the characters to the dialogue, and even the questionable acting in some parts. There is still great directing and cinematography as you would expect, and it's a pretty decent thriller overall. But I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone, especially to younger people who are interested in great classic movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
No towering achievement,"Alfred Hitchcock has a reputation as one of the outstanding film-makers of his era; but to a modern viewer, 'Vertigo' disappoints. The plotting is as torturous as any modern thriller, but the 1950 production values continually let it down: one grows tired of out-of-doors scenes transparently shot in the studio (and even the scenes actually shot on location are curiously devoid of passers-by), there's a very clumsy (though admittedly innovative) dream sequence, even the fact that the two leads are unable to even kiss each other properly starts to grate after a while. This might suggest that Hitchcock's only failing with this movie was over-ambition, but unfortunately, it isn't so: for he also fails to get decent performances from his leading actors, stiff-as-a-board Jimmy Stweart and icy Kim Novak (a typical Hitchcock blonde) generate absolutely no on-screen chemistry. And both have complex roles to play: one of them undergoes a kind of nervous breakdown, while the other simulates the same thing; but neither can play their roles with sufficient depth to make this story work as psychological melodrama. There is one interesting female character - played by Barbara Bel Geddes - but she is mysteriously written out half way though for no good reason. Compare the performances in this movie to those being put in by the likes of Marlon Brando or Orson Welles at the same period in time, and one has to pass harsh judgement. There are still a few interesting details: it's amazing how little dialogue Hitchcock dares get away with, and the very bleak ending is surprising for a mainstream film. But it's impossible to invest any emotional feeling in the story; and that's surprising, given Hitchcock's towering legend.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The quality of picture is not the only thing noticeable.  Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak are outstanding.  The premise is made believable by the two stars and the way Hitch continually shows Stewart observing Novak from afar:  growing more and more intrigued. The premise?

One of Hitchcock real masterpieces,"Hitchcock's masterpiece about a retired police detective with fears of heights. He is hired by a friend to shadow his wife which has acted very strange lately.This is a movie that demands very much of the viewer. You have to watch all of the movie - and you certainly will. Because this movie will spellbind you for two hours.Many critics think the first half hour is slow and many minutes could have been cut. But in fact these scenes are necessary for the whole movie to work. And by the way, the beginning is not boring. It's like the beginning of Psycho - it slowly builds up and is therefore necessary to understand the whole picture.The movie is like a boiling soup that will boil over at any minute. Both Psycho and Vertigo explode in the end (not a bomb!). Leaving the audience stunned by the end.

"A killer combination - Stewart, Novak, Herrmann, Hitchcock and the perfect script","""Vertigo"" is one of those killer combinations where just about everything fits like a glove. For one there's the ingenious screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor based on the French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""(usually translated as ""From the Realm of the Dead""). It's a spellbinding narration of a retired San Francisco police detective who gets caught up in mysterious events with supernatural undertones, peppered by deception, betrayal, crime and obsession. Then there's the cast: John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is played in understated fashion by James Stewart, the epitome of the humble, humane gentleman and good friend who cannot deny a favor. Confronting him with mystifying blond sexbomb Kim Novak really gets things rolling and is electrifying to see. Every moment of the main characters' difficult relationship throughout the film is absolutely believable and their chemistry on screen evident and riveting. In the music department Bernard Herrmann once again outdoes himself with an engrossing score, which will make you hold your breath in anticipation of what lies ahead - or hit you right in the face whenever necessary, and that's a good thing. The cinematography? Pitch perfect. Locations like the Golden Gate Bridge shine in all their Technicolor glory as do striking camera shots like the one from the roof at the very beginning or those from the Old Mission San Juan Bautista bell tower.All the brilliance is carefully constructed and well held together by master director Alfred Hitchcock himself, who knows how to pull one into the film, how to get into the characters, how to make one dizzy (with style!) - and how to zoom in while at the same time physically pulling the camera back, the astonishing trademark shot of ""Vertigo"". A film to be watched again and again, practically flawless and all the way masterfully executed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Good classic,"Good classic film. Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music.

Consensus be damned.,"Like an especially elegant and self absorbed visualization of a Nancy Drew novel, Hithcock's Vertigo is a tale of two acts. One a compelling ghost story/noir, and one an absolute train wreck of loose ends and inauthentic characters.I can recognize the mastery Hitchcock at times displays- creating a sense of tension with a stepladder was awe inspiring. It is a masterclass in cinematography, and for much of the first act a really well done ghost story. Really really stylish, rivaled only by Barry Lyndon in its stills.Unfortunately, Vertigo goes south with its main character. The mystery's answer is revealed after just over an hour of the film's two hour run time. For the rest of its duration, the spotlight is inexorably cast on a thoroughly inauthentic romance between Scotty and Judy. Old 'masterpieces' run into this problem where women behave solely for the convenience of the plot. It is difficult for me to enjoy a film that portrays such a beautiful actress as strictly an object for the plot and for its main character, who literally dolls her up.And for failing to keep the audience's attention for just short of an hour, Hitchcock rewards them by shoving their face in misplaced irony with an ending that undermines any integrity the film had built to that point.All this to say, I did not like Vertigo.5/10: Meh.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Amazing,"I saw vertigo for the first time a few months ago and it is now tied for my favorite Hitchcock film (with rear window) and its the best film i've ever seen.

It's hard to pull off a dual role and i think she did it very well. If your just getting into Hitchcock then i recommend Vertigo for anyone who wants to be blown away, I mean it was just that amazing!

One of the best films of all time,"If you've only encountered the films of Alfred Hitchcock through scary films like PSYCHO and THE BIRDS then you are missing out on the bulk of his work and some of the finest motion pictures ever made. I had the privilege of checking out one of his best films, VERTIGO, on the big screen as part of the EMAGINE WILLOW CREEK's SECRET CINEMA series - and what a treat it was.Starring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, VERTIGO is a film about obsession, desire, deception and murder all told in a package by the great Hitchock that pops off the screen and into your brain. EVERY part of this film works and it still holds up 60 years after it's release.Stewart stars as John ""Scotty"" Ferguson a former Police Detective who must retire from the force because of his severe acrophobia (fear of heights) heightened by vertigo. He is asked by a friend to follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) for fear that she is suicidal. I won't spoil what happens from there, but Hitchcock puts us on the trail of a psychological thriller where Scotty is both the hero and the heel - a real balancing act to pull off and one that needs a beloved actor like Jimmy Stewart in order to be successful. We instantly start liking - and trusting - Scotty from the beginning only to start to lose our trust of him as the events unfold. Stewart's performance is one of the best of his career and holds our attention throughout.Equally captivating is Novak's portrayal of the suicidal wife, Madeleine, who is equal parts beautiful, mysterious and cagey. Without giving too much away, Scotty starts to fall for Madeleine and with Novak's performance, I can see why. She has the trickier part to play in this film and plays the layers of her character well.But this is a Hitchcock film through and through - and shows a top director at the top of his game. From the opening note of Bernard Hermann's off-kilter score to the use of color, place and camera movement, Hitchcock keeps the viewer off-center throughout the film, immersing us in a world that is not quite real, not quite false, which mirrors the reality (or un-reality) that Scotty is dealing with himself.If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do. If you have not seen this film on the large screen, I doubly strongly encourage you to do so. as it will be theaters on March 18 & 21 as part of Turner Classic Movie's Big Screen Classics film series.Vertigo was recently sited by the BFI Site and Sound poll as the best film of all time, and while I don't quite share that rating of it, I do rate it as ONE of the top films of all time.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's most personal film,"Although my favourite Hitchcock film is Strangers On A Train, this is his masterpiece as well as one of his darkest films since it deals with the theme of obsession.  This movie is the closest Hitch comes to fully expressing his inner demons to nearly being explicit.  The beginning of this film can be seen as a continuation of Rear Window.  Vertigo (1958) also deals with some similar themes explored in Rear Window (1954).  This is the third film that deals with a person's mental state.  The other two being Spellbound (1946), which dealt with a man's fear of white, and Marnie (1964), which dealt with the main character's fear of red.  This motion picture is a highlight of the director's fame career and should be considered on any top ten greatest films list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Surprising,"The movie began with an atmosphere that deceived me, as it gave me the impression that the movie was exploring the existence of the supernatural. This initial assumption, as well as the mood of the movie, remained so until near the end. I have to admit that I hadn't seen any Hitchcock films before and since films of the 50s rarely go in the direction of the mythical, I thought that Hitchcock was trying something new. But in the end I got a concentrated load of realism that turned my entire previously described conception of the movie on its head. The resolution was quite surprising, almost arbitrary. But this assessment of the ending may also be due to the fact that I wasn't remotely expecting this kind of punchline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One Of The Many Films Which Personifies Hitchcock's Legacy,"Many would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's true triumph, the film which defines his work and a film which has been a major influence on cinema as a whole. Vertigo is famous for many reasons; it is famous for being both a masterpiece and for being one of the most sexually-obsessive films ever made. As with most Hitchcock films sex is a frequently occurring and underlying theme, Hitchcock uses sexuality to propel the key narrative. Personally, I see Vertigo as an example of male-lust, obsession and perversion. Some might go as far as saying Vertigo is about Hitchcock's own attraction to women, which in Vertigo is dangerously perverse. Vertigo is a film which is open to interpretation and one which requires the utmost concentration. To fully gain the film's brilliance you need to first re-watch it, as the common trend is to be perplexed by the film's complex narrative structure.Vertigo continues to be one of the optimal psychological thrillers, a film which has stood the test of time and becomes greater and greater with age. Vertigo is the tale of ""Scottie"" (played by James Stewart), a San Francisco policeman who is haunted by his severe acrophobia, which is caused from the guilt of an accidental death he feels responsible for. Due to Scott's condition he feels confined to secluding himself from police work, until an old friend asks him a favour. The favour is to ""spy"" on his beautiful wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he has become suspicious off due to the idea that she is possessed by a dead relative. So, Scottie tracks down Madeline, while quickly becoming pulled inside a mysterious and menacing world of lies and obsession.There are countless occurring themes throughout Hitchcock's films, which include mistaken identity, voyeurism, obsession, sexual compulsion, reliance, absurdity, paradoxes, irony and perversion. All of these contribute to making Hitchcock's films some of the most analytically accessible. Vertigo is an example of just how fierce Hitchcock can be through the harsh tones that he has etched into the film. The delicate moments of brief intimacy in Vertigo are ones which become abruptly destroyed by painful sorrow. These moments are devastating, as you are watching a man become more and more entranced by a woman he is failing to grasp.Hitchcock uses hypnotically mesmerising camera work and dizzying lens filtering to create an unbearably ominous ""Hitchcockian"" environment. The stark colours, which are wonderfully vibrant, help to create a sincere mood of looming menace and tension. The use of perspective distortion (most notably the Dolly zoom) is another factor of the sublime skill behind the camera. When establishing the film's meaning you have to carefully annotate the use of colours, shadows and mirrors, which are all, used as metaphors for the protagonist's emotions and help to craft Scottie as one of the most multi-dimensional characters in cinematic history.With the additional blending of Bernard Herrmann's score you find yet another addition to add to the film's distinguishable quality at creating an extremely polarising and cold ambiance. Finally, you have the outstanding set-pieces and one in particular which will linger in the depths of your mind for eternity. What makes the set-pieces so perfect is how they are so remarkably appropriate for the essence of each scene.The acting from the entire cast is indistinguishable, in the sense that the acting is so sublime that it is actually too difficult to truly say who gave a better performance than the other. Although, I will certainly express how James Stewart's surprising casting as a fairly menacing character is one which remains one of the most unexpectedly perfected performances of all-time. He slides into the character with a cold-hearted and unnerving stance, providing insight into a multi-dimensional character which can be scrutinised to the finest detail for hours on end. Though, it is still not James Stewart's greatest performance (I would give It's a Wonderful Life the edge) it is unquestionably the finest film he ever starred in.Vertigo is the film which signifies Hitchcock's own persona, while categorically remaining his ultimate masterpiece. Few films can succeed in captivating and entrancing countless emotions upon its viewer. Vertigo is cinematic flawlessness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Good thriller,"Good thriller. During my first viewing of the film I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing ""spoof"" versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place. Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments. Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.Whilst I heard a few years ago about the now mis-quoted infamous quote about how Hitchcock through actors should be treated,with this amazing film,I think that it is very easy to actually see that Hitchcock wanted to get the best performances from the stunning cast.

Hitchcock can make a good movie without a plausible plot.,"This movie entertains because the director uses the beauty of San Francico, Kim Novak and a good score. The first time I saw this movie, the absurdities were overcome by the above. But after seeing the movie for the third or fourth times, the plot begins to grate on my penchant for logic. I don't mind fantasy, or even science fiction. But, its got to be logical. I find the concept of entering into a murder conspiracy with an accomplice who is as attractive as Kim Novak, and not insist that she move, is simply unblievable. Take it from an old detective, San Francico in the 50's was not big enough to hide a Kim Novak from the eye of a good detective. Then there is the scene at the tower. Its not bad enough that we have to see it once, we see it several times in cartoon color. when you commit a murder, you better think of as many varibles as you can, or you will get caught. Unless you murder some street person and nobody cares. The complex murder scheme makes for great entertainment. But consider this point. How sure could you be that Scotty would leave the scene? Even if he left the tower, the odds are that he would remain in the area. He's a former cop. He's just witnessed a suicide. He can't leave. One of the most absurd scenes is at the inquest, where he is having his character pummeled. Was this the writer's attempt to make Scotty's leaving the scene seem the most logical reaction?

I was stunned to learn that this wasn't a huge success when it was released, gladly it is now regarded as a classic.Vertigo truly is a great movie, it must rank as one of the great Alfred Hitchcock's finest movies.The film itself feels like two acts, the first is all about Scottie's increasing obsession with Madeleine, the second half sees him dealing with life after the 'accident,' looking for answers, and searching for happiness.The opening sequences instantly grabbed the viewer's attention, and set the tone for the rest of the film. It's full of twists and turns, the best moment however for me was Scottie's nightmare, so trippy, not something I imagine audiences at the time would have been used to.Scottie is an interesting one, he's not the easiest character to like, at times he seems a little possessive, controlling, even coercive, but maybe he has an ulterior motive, you'll have to watch to find out.Production values are terrific, you can see that Hitchcock had a big influence over the tiniest details, the music is phenomenal, especially that opening score.I thought James Stewart was excellent, I bought into his character instantly, I really did get the impression of someone jaded, desperately looking for something after the death of his colleague, maybe love.Novak was equally good as Madeleine, and so much more than just the dazzling beauty, she displayed some true skill.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Just how great is Vertigo?,"Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work stars James Stewart as a former policeman turn detective in 1950's San Francisco.

Vertigo's conclusion is anything but satisfying but rather a life-changing slap in the face. It is probably the greatest film ever made. Stewart and his costar Kim Hunter also give their greatest performances. Barbara Bel Geddes's small supporting performance is equally effective.

Hitchcock sure was a wonderful director (no problem with rear window's direction) and deserved at least an Oscar but I think Academy has ever been silly. Performance, direction, cinematography and all part of movie were fine enough and the story was told in an interesting Thrilling+Romantic way and The original score of movie was sweet.Inshort, It was a very well made and fine movie but Its not 10/10 good for me. but It sure is very good.

Best Movie Ever Made,"I'm not going to be able to say anything about this that hasn't already been said but I recently decided it was my favourite movie of all time.Evidence for claim:It's the only film I've ever watched twice in a row (as in: rewind the tape to the start as soon as the screen fades to back and press PLAY)Vertigo deals with love as obsession - one of the best definitions of Love and one I (worringly) tend to adhere to.That soundtrack. Herrmann's most moving, haunting and disturbing score. I kept replaying the opening credits just to listen to the music. I play it in my head at least every other day.It was underrated in its day by almost everyone - usually the sign of a masterpiece (anything by Kubrick)and too many others qualifying arguments to list.First time viewers might want to be advised about the pacing in the first half - it is purposely slow - but the second time you see it you won't notice because you'll be in the 'dream' that much quicker.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Excellent drama with perfect atmosphere,"Since I started with old films - Chaplin, Hitchcock, Kubrick, I just found something like a second home. Almost all of them have special atmosphere that at least works at me. But Vertigo is different. I didn't expect much of it, but that was the point. You play the film, expect nothing, and it's masterpiece! Alfred kept us during the film in suspense, expectations, and of course many questions. But in the end, Hitchcock answered all of (at least my) questions, and completed my expectations. What's so special about this film? It does make sense, it makes you ask yourself questions or create combinations why this happened, and so on. Definitely worth watching, even because of it's length - 2 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds. Since I saw this film, Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I can't wait watching his masterpieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Surreal, mystifying, and masterfully done all around.","From the beginning, I was allured into it. The plot of this movie is more supernatural and magical than some of his others.

Almost every moment gave me a feeling of apprehension and excitement. Everything in the film feels uncanny and too good to be true, yet so convincingly done.

This is a Hitchcock masterpiece that is an absolute must see,"Vertigo (1958) is currently available on Prime and tells the tale of a former police detective hired to monitor a friend's wife who he claims has been acting strange. She initially appears to be trying to kill herself and the detective saves her several times and eventually falls in love with her. Will love stop her suicide attempts? This movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars James Stewart (Rear Window), Kim Novak (Kiss Me, Stupid), Barbara Bel Geddes (Panic in the Streets) and Tom Helmore (The Time Machine). The storyline for this is very well written by Hitchcock and contains several good twists. Stewart was awesome as the main characters and Novak was solid in her supporting role. There was great chemistry between them. Hitchcock did a great job displaying people's fears and how they are impacted by them. The conclusion is awesome- it gets uncomfortably pushy at times but does a great job of coming full circle. This is a Hitchcock masterpiece that is an absolute must see that I would score an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Everybody's dizzy...,"Some films are able to twist time to their advantage. Few contemporary critics cared for Vertigo when it debuted (though some will lie otherwise). Today, critics have enshrined it as Hitchcock's finest. A shame.Vertigo's first hour is hypnotic. Jimmy Stewart, a retired cop who suffers from the title ailment, is persuaded by a friend to follow his wife, suicidal Kim Novak, for her own protection. One especially excellent scene involves Stewart examining Novak as she walks through a garden and studies a picture. The mystery seeps through the film's atmosphere, and the scene is quietly beautiful in a way Hitchcock seldom is.Eventually, Novak does kill herself, and so does the film. Stewart soon meets a woman closely resembling Novak and grows obsessed with her. There is a plot twist, but it is so terribly transparent I doubt anyone is surprised. Unfortunately, what little suspense lurks in the second half hinges on this twist, negating Hitchcock's supreme talent. Characters begin acting with little or no believable motivation, and Stewart descends into frenzied rants and raves that are pretty funny to watch. The surprise ending is foolishly revealed before the ending, and when the final scene finally arrives, the melodrama is hilarious. The film nosedives after a promising start and wrecks itself.Critics praise the second half of the film as self-revelation on the part of Hitchcock. Maybe, but most people do not watch films because they care about the director. They watch films because they like films, and Hitchcock's films are more interesting than Hitchcock himself. Naturally, Hitchcock scholars are interested in Hitchcock, and this interest accounts for Vertigo's inflated reputation. The sad truth is Vertigo is a flawed failure.I'm wagering time will straighten itself out. In twenty years, true Hitchcock classics such as North by Northwest will replace Vertigo at the top of critics' list When it does, I'll be the one collecting bets and wearing an obnoxiously smug grin.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
an excellent weaving by Hitchcock,"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, the other two being North by Northwest and the comical The Trouble with Harry. The setting of San Francisco was, in my personal opinion, a big drawing card. To be sure, Hitchcock knew well how to weave together suspense, romance, and mystery. James Stewart and Kim Novak clicked well together in this masterpiece by the master of suspense. And, Kim Novak was quite talented at playing two roles in this movie. Stewart was also adept at playing two types of people, a kind, good natured man, but also a hostile, temperamental man in places. You wanted to hate Tom Elmore. It was structured so very well also; it was almost like two dramas in one. Bernard Herrmann, an excellent musician, definitely and effectively provided the needed eeriness for the film. And, the color was beautiful. Because of the eeriness of the film, the excellent acting, the, again, very beautiful setting of San Francisco, as well as the suspenseful story, again, this ranks among one of my favorite all-time movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

I LOVE CINEMA!!!!!,"I just finished watching Vertigo (1958) for the first time ever and this movie is an masterpiece in cinema.Positives for Vertigo (1958):
This movie is one of the most intense, suspenseful and psychological movies I have ever seen in my life. You can tell that Alfred Hitchcock went all out with this movie and I couldn't be any happier about that. It goes without saying that the performances from the entire cast are phenomenal in this movie especially James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson and Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster. James Stewart's character of Scottie is one of the most interesting and complex movie protagonists I have ever seen in any movie. Stewart's performance adds so many levels to this character that has me attention throughout the entire runtime. I can say the same for Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine as she is also very complex and this woman has to play two different characters and she makes both of them stand out in their ways. These two characters and their romance is one of the best onscreen relationships I've seen in any movie and it's even better than some of the relationships in modern movies. There was something about the their relationship and attraction to each other that is so endearing and haunting that you can't help but pay attention to them. And finally, the climax of this movie is so wacky and balls out insane that I couldn't help but applaud Hitchcock for his achievements.Overall, Vertigo (1958) is one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema and it is among my top 3 favorite movies from Alfred Hitchcock's legendary filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"A Phobia, A Plot and The Haunting","😱 First Impressions:
The first ever work I saw of Alfred Hitchcock was Psycho- revolutionary as a slasher but I grew hungrier for more his thriller masterpieces. Then I saw Dial M for Murder and finally Vertigo. Though I had my doubts initially, this has arguably become one of my absolute favorites by the legend.Pros:
😋 The ensemble cast. It goes without saying of course that the director knows how to pick them! But I must absolutely commend the range of protagonists Scottie and Madeliene/Judy who essentially play two different characters each or rather the impression that they are.😋 The first time watching it (even sometimes when rewatching it), I could not foresee the shocker of an ending. The over-the-top albeit ingenious of a murder scheme is absolutely entertaining and I can only blame myself for falling in love with the characters... getting too attached.😋 The cinematography is beautiful; throughout it's runtime there comes the occasionally rare moment portraying a ephemeral quality; much akin to that of a ghost's or the otherwordliness (in keeping with the theme after all). It stays with you. Even the act of describing and then later on showing the dream sequences are terrifying.Cons:
😪 There was that one part in the film where I thought the reveal was rather quick and sudden- we had just gotten to know Kim Novak's second character, Judy. I mean obviously they are played by the one and only actress but there could have been a much longer psychological game to play juggling between the two women. Is it just a striking resemblance? Doesn't it say more about the character of Scottie, seemingly unable to move on after changing Judy's appearance only to find out it was all worthless.😪 Midge's character never saw an ending or resolution. At least with Madeleine's husband, it's explained that he has left after having perfectly executed the deed with his late wife. I thought she was phenomenal! Pining after Scottie, she was the only one there to help him after his mental breakdown. It's not really a vexing issue but one I just felt sorry for- perhaps that was the goal.😇Verdict😈
One of the most iconic thrillers that played with audience's expectation start to finish. Usually I am quite good at guessing how the endings would go to slashers, thrillers or even horror movies in general. But when it comes to Alfred Hitchcock's portfolio, I always seem to miss the mark. The endings always endure in the back of your mind long after the viewing and that's something we have yet to see in a modern thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Good, but the greatness eludes me.","The greatness of this film eludes me. It's certainly a good film, and I liked it, but whatever element this film has that makes it any better than the rest of Hitchcock's movies remains unseen by me. To be honest, the only idea that makes me value it any more than a standard Hitchcock thriller is its honesty -- that Jimmy Stewart's controlling nature over Kim Novak parallels Hitchcock's own controlling nature over his actresses.The most thrilling moment of the entire film, for me, was the opening credits, with those classic spirals and the first hint of Bernard Herrmann's great score.The story is simple: a cop (Jimmy Stewart), after watching one of his buddies fall to his death, contracts vertigo and acrophobia and leaves the force. Then, one day, when an old school friend calls him to keep an eye on his wife (Kim Novak) who's been acting strangely, believing she's someone else, he gets involved once more. Stewart falls in love with Novak, whom he saves from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, but her aloof nature and apparent psychological damage prevents her from returning the love.Then something happens that would be criminal to give away.I just don't see what makes this movie great, or stand out among Hitchcock's other work. Is it really because it's so personal? Maybe there's something I'm missing, maybe there are subtleties placed throughout the film that I didn't get and that I've completely misunderstood the point of the movie. As far as I can see, though, the film's ""complex"" message is that love is either one big trick or a perverted obsession. (Either that, or I'm forced to venture desperately into dream territory: ""Oh, you know, everything after so-and-so was a dream, and that, therefore, makes the movie real complex."")I admire the film's craft, and I didn't find it boring or anything, but I was expecting something very complex, much more than this. I also felt for the heartbroken Stewart, as well as the Midge character, his admirer. I could also sympathize with Novak's character, as she's manipulated by Stewart.Aside from the opening credits, which I adore, my favorite part of the movie may well be the restaurant where we first see Novak. That incredibly red room must have influenced Peter Greenaway when he made ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."" There are also a few camera moves that are nice, and thanks to the terrific transfer, the colors, images, and sounds (which are essential to the film's appeal) are impeccable.While I want to understand what it is people feel that makes them call this movie great, and I'll see it again sometime, I'm not going to re-watch it just so I can ""get"" it. I'm generally not a fan of re-watching movies to discover their greatness -- I find most people who do that are, in effect, lying to themselves the second time, convinced that they ""get"" it. I hate to be part of the dissent, especially when favorites of mine like ""Fargo"" have an equally enthusiastic following that denounces them as completely unexceptional. But as it stands, this movie is just a well-crafted, more-personal-than-usual thriller.***",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Vertigo,"Fear of heights needless to say, I suspect the detective has necrophilia, or a tendency to necrophilia, but the movie is very cryptic...

An all time great,"Vertigo is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the greatest movies of all time. Its most noticeable strength is the use of vibrant color, which Vertigo wields to convey themes of lust, death, and guilt. The cinematography continues with complex arc shots and dolly zooms that are utilized throughout. Meanwhile, more subtle framing compositions are consistently setting up mysterious tones and motifs surrounding obsession. However, Vertigo is far more than just its visuals.Vertigo is also masterfully written. The story starts as a simple thriller but develops thoughtful purpose. Opposing forces like fear/attraction, passion/death, repetition/distortion are explored in concise yet elusive ways. The music ties this together with ethereal yet uneasy melodies, fitting perfectly because it nails the sensation of disoriented freefall (both physically and mentally). Additionally, the special effects evoke a surreal atmosphere. Matte paintings and rear projections give this intimate story a grander feel. Throw in a trippy dream sequence that is a flavorful departure from the film's meticulous pace, and we have a wholly impactful experience. All told, it is clear why Vertigo is considered a masterpiece and still influential today.Writing: 10/10

Prime Hitchcock,"As mesmerizing as it is long and difficult to comprehend, ""Vertigo"" is one of cinema's strangest tales of romantic obsession, the kind that certainly would not be made nowadays, since the subject is increasingly demonized in the American culture. Surprisingly enough, it works, in large part through the director's mastery over the medium. Some speculate that it was a highly personal project for him, a casting out of his own internal struggles. Such theories validity is questionable, but anyone watching will notice the movie's much lesser degree of calculating, joyful logic that almost all other Hitchcock's works are saturated with. Incredibly true to its title, by virtue of an eerie score and some dizzying cinematography, the movie induces the sense of romantic vertigo in the audience. A fantastic opening credits sequence which resembles digital animation, suggests a visionary quality that refused to be confined to its time period.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Dark side of romantic love,"***SPOILERS BELOW***What I find striking about this film is how it presents such a pessimistic view of romantic love.James Stewart (as Scotty) starts out playing one of his average-guy hero characters, who falls into depression and then into a troubling obsession because of his misplaced romantic love.Most films seem to glorify romance & love. Hitchcock seems to have wanted to point out that though this emotion can be at the center of our lives it is often based upon superficialities.Many films present love as something that is destine to happen between two people. I think that Hitchcock was having fun with this idea, flipping it on its head and twisting it with all sorts of irony...e.g. The person who Scotty fell so deeply in love with did not really exist, she was simply an 'act' (i.e. It's Judy pretending to be Madeleine, who were two very different types of women).Scotty fell completely for the con-job that was Judy pretending to be Madeleine. Then to complicate things Judy in turn also falls in love with him.As part of a murder scheme, Scotty is led to believe 'his' Madeleine has died, in part, due to his negligence. Later when he is wandering the streets of San Francisco he stumbles upon Judy whom he thinks only looks like his lost love. He then strikes up a romantic relationship with her... But Scotty does not appear to be capable of loving Judy for who she really is. e.g. He had become morbidly obsessed with Judy's fake version of Madeleine and he pressures Judy into looking & acting like her (once again), which she does out of love for him.Because of Judy's love for Scotty she decides that her tastes, preferences and even her personality didn't really matter anymore... e.g. Judy gives-in to Scotty's desires and takes on the personality of someone very different from herself.In one sense Scotty is the archetypal romantic hero, who against all odds finds his lost love. But in another sense he is a 'sucker' and someone who has been rendered mentally unstable by his love for a woman who never really existed.Contrast this with Scotty's best friend (Midge), a fairly attractive woman who adores him. Compared to Judy, Midge seems like a woman much more suited to Scotty's tastes. But he is just too romantically fixated on Judy's 'faux' Madeleine for Midge to have a real shot at him.This movie is great for a lot of reasons, many of which have already been mentioned here in other reviews, including: 1.) Novak skillfully playing two very different personalities. 2.) The view it gives us of San Francisco circa the 1950's. 3.) The movie's plot goes through very interesting thematic changes (Starting as a supernatural love story/drama then changing mid-stream into a psychological drama heavily laden with irony.). 4.) It has a wonderful musical score. 5.) And there is a VERY dark ending to the story (Something almost unheard of in American movies prior to the mid-1960's)There are some slight glitches to this film's storyline, None of which I feel are too distracting with the possible exception of the somewhat convoluted wife-murder-scheme, which might seem too far-fetched for some people to accept. But then again, this murder scheme seems just as believable as those portrayed in many of Agatha Christie's famous stories.If I remember correctly Hitchcock said that he felt that such background details were not that important when trying to get an audience immersed into a story. Hey the story works for me! This is one of my favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Recently saw it on the big screen,"I must say that if you have a chance to see it at the theater, you absolutely must! All of the street scenes in and around Sam Francisco come to life, details that you miss on your home screen. The colors and images are so detailed and vivid it mesmerizes. It's especially delicious if you've ever been to San Francisco and San Juan Batista. The scene at Ernie's gives you an appreciation of fine dining in another era. All the men are in formal or semi-formal dress and the ladies in elegant evening gowns. The super-imposed scenes are also more evident, such as the scene at the lone cypress on the coast, show how Hitchcock wanted perfection in a scene, even when he has a perfect location.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Vertigo,"This was a thought that streamed through my head, what's going to happen next? Which kept me in tuned and drawn to my seat, with no attention of leaving until it was over.

If you watch a film more than once and get new information out of it every time, thats what I would consider a great movie. Also great actors to play these parts and a contribute in this classic, made this film that much better. Hithcock couldn't have gone wrong with the actors who played these amazing characters. A great film I would say the least.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Nostalgic, nothing more","It was after I heard that Vertigo had replaced Citizen Kane as 'Best Movie of all Time' that I pondered as to whether I had actually seen this film. This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.It's purely personal of course.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"one of the greatest works of art, alltime","There are many good films, and it may seem pretentious to think in terms of superlatives.  There are many good paintings, good plays, good books, but then there are some that tower just so high that they dwarf everything around them and defy analysis of any kind, either technical or aesthetic.I have just about every film which appears in the 'top 250' here at imdb, and Vertigo is my favorite, by a steep margin.  It's sublime, it hits on so many cylinders.  The color, the lighting, the symbolism, the drama, the personal dilemmas, the acting, the direction.There are some moments in art that are so rare, that they cannot even be measured by media, let alone eras.  In the genre of staged drama, 19th century and forward, I see maybe four titans: Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, and Hitchcock.  I can't think of any other movie director who soars as high, and it's not just Hitchcock who soars high in this movie.  It's also Bernard Hermann's music and Jimmy Stewart's acting.  It's the people who shot the film.  It's just a magical moment.What makes it happen?  Hitchcock, who is not only at the height of his powers, but is delving so deep into his subconscious that it defies analysis.  He creates an image in a movie with the same frenzied detail that Scotty seeks as he re-creates Madelaine.  The richness of Hitchcock's vision here is without rival in this history of film, as far as I am aware.As for other great Hitchcock films, there are Rear Window, Notorious, North by Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, and one of my personal favorites, Psycho.  But this one, Vertigo, this one goes all the way into Hitch's deepest thoughts.  It may very well be the greatest artistic creation of the 20th century.  It is certainly one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Very well constructed indeed,"The legend that is Alfred Hitchcock needs absolutely no introduction, so I won't waste time with rhetoric.Vertigo is a psychological mystery starring the fantastic James Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired detective who is approached by an old school/college friend, Gavin Elster, and requested to follow the gentleman's wife, in the vein of a private detective. The reason for the pursuit is the friend's wife Madeleine is acting bizarrely, and Elster believes she is literally possessed by a ghost. She seems to have conscious blackouts and doesn't remember things which have happened to her.Scottie reluctantly gets involved and follows her, studying her intriguing behaviour and trying to figure out what on earth is happening to her, without making contact. However, after a dramatic event at the Golden Gate Bridge, the 2 'meet' and Scottie finds himself getting involved to an unprofessional level...James Stewart, as expected, is spell binding. He truly is the most popular star of all time and with performances like this it was not hard to see why. He brings an everyman personability to every role, and is never less than utterly likable. His down to earth charm is always as gripping as it is believable.Kim Novak, as the troubled Madeleine, is also absolutely excellent in a type of Sugar Cane but-more-serious-type of role as the perfect woman who seems unobtainable. Her slightly austere personality fits the story perfectly.The last major player next to Elster is Midge Wood, a type of live in 'friend' who stays with Scottie. She is also completely besotted with him but it doesn't seem entirely mutual. Balanced but infatuated, her existence is a slightly tortured one.The direction is the 4th major character here, and I say that deliberately. It is quite outstanding, with some truly rich colouring, top class cinematography, and impressive special effects. The world of Vertigo is brought to life by a true master of cinema in Hitchcock.It might not have the claustrophobia or wit of Rear Window, or the horror of Psycho, but it's clearly intended as a movie entirely on its own merits.A great tale and utterly timeless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Ooh, what a rush!!","No-one enjoyed toying with people's minds quite like Hitch; and ""Vertigo"" is a film that earns its right to sit proudly alongside his other psychological masterpieces. Stewart is superb and perfectly cast as the archetypal 'common man' who, after an accident, suddenly finds himself embroiled in a dizzying mystery he struggles to keep up with. If this all sounds a bit too ""Rear Window"", it plays sufficiently fresh to offer its own distinct pleasures, but it would probably be true to say that fans of one will certainly delight in the other, as well.From the captivating vortex of the title sequence onward, ""Vertigo"" plunges headlong into the story. This wouldn't be Hitchcock without even a hint of a Macguffin, but the real power of the story for me came from being drawn into someone's obsession, and of course the stunning climax of its ultimate resolution.

Hitchcock's Ravishing Masterpirce,"The only caveat I would give first time viewers is that its slow pace, meant to be hypnotic and seductive, may be off-putting to some. If, however, you allow yourself to be drawn into the mystery the way Scotty(Stewart) is, then you should be swept away by Hitchcock's most ravishing, deeply personal film. Stewart's obsession with Novack's character mirrors the director's own attachments to his leading ladies. Listen carefully to Scotty's comments to her on the belltower's steps near the end, and this will become apparent.
This is the best film of the 50's, with only Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve to give it any competition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Not sure why this is so highly regarded,"I don't see why this is regarded so highly. Do people feel obliged to love Alfred Hitchcock movies? Psycho, Rear Window and Rebecca are masterpieces but Vertigo is not in their league, not even close.I personally found Vertigo quite long-winded and bordering on boring. Hitchcock takes forever to set the scene, then having set it, instead of ramping up the pace, continues to drag out the story.Many of the key turning points and plot developments are contrived and implausible. Things happen, sparking something suspenseful or action-filled but they make very little sense as a plot development.Good performances by James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes though. Despite the thinness of the plot, Hitchcock still manages to create a decent amount of tension and suspense, proving why he is the Master of Suspense.Overall it's okay but nothing more than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Disguised as a Detective Thriller!,"The opening title credits of Vertigo have to be the most alluring, engulfing,  provoking titles Hollywood has ever seen.  The spirals guide you into the state  of mind of the characters, as well as the tone of the film.Jimmy Stuart, plays against type, classic of Hitchcock's directorial style. He  transforms Stuart from the Aw Shucks character we all love, to an obsessive, anxiety-driven flawed human being.  And Kim Novack- how did she learn to act so quickly?  Her performance is breathtaking to say the least.What makes Vertigo very enjoyable for me is that it's a love story disguised as a  detective thriller.  Sure, the suspense is there, and more effective than ever, but  this movie is about LOVE.  Oh, love justifies why Judy lets Scotty do those horrible things to her.  Love explains why Scotty loses her in the first place.   Hitchcock has proven himself as the master of suspense, but I think that this film,  along with Notorious, elevates him to a director that understands the burning  passion that can exist between two people.The music, once again Bernard Herman has come through, really ties the film together.  There is actually more music than dialog, setting the mood and hypnotizing us ever so gently.  The nightmare sequence is reason enough to see it- so abstract, so expressionistic.  Finally, the use of color and> cinematography bring forth a dimension that was totally new and unexpected in  Hollywood.I would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's best film.  I would argue that it's even  one of the best American films ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Obsession is our greatest disease,"This is the closest that comes to my all-time favorite and most effecting film. When I tell someone to see only one Hitchcock film this is it. Not because it displays all of Hitch's talent, but for a greater reason. After having seen nearly forty of his films it seems there is no set style, the PSYCHO ""shower"" scene is not how we should judge Hitchcock, his restraint and minimal work is his best(i.e. SHADOW of a DOUBT, NOTORIOUS, REBECCA). Try not to feel for Stewert's ""Scotty"", it is hard since a lot of us have a little of him in us. It definitely is a film that exists in the universe of Hitchcock films (a man on the run, or falsely accused, or seeking the truth). I promise you will be drawn in.

Most over rated film in the history of film.,"Hitchcock was never known for the casting of good actors, women mostly. Kim Novak was quite possibly his worst choice. She is laughably bad.

One for your classic collection,"No collection of movie classics would be complete without at least one film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. ""Vertigo"" was made at the height of his success, but it was not well- received at the time and only later judged to be one of the Master's greatest works. Based on a French novel, it is a psychological thriller with an odd, unsettling feel, starring James Stewart as the recently retired San Francisco policeman John ""Scottie"" Ferguson who has the eponymous fear of heights and Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster who appears to be either mentally ill or spiritually possessed.After an attention-grabbing opening chase sequence on the city's roof tops, the first half of the movie is a slow series of scenes in which the private eye follows the mysterious blonde in a narrative that becomes increasingly bizarre. Suddenly the work changes tack and gear and gradually the first segment is explained but in terms which are deeply disturbing. As well as a jarring sound track, Hitchcock uses a variety of cinematic techniques to throw the viewer off balance including the invention of a technical trick involving simultaneous zoom-in and track-back to convey the sense of vertigo.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
PERFECT CINEMA,"THE MOST EXQUISITE FILM EVER MADE !!!!!!!!!!

They don't make em like they used to,"Movies these days are all exactly the same. They are either stupid, lame comedies, boring, overly dramatic, ridiculous chick flicks, or AWFUL horrors.But back in the day (not my day, I'm only 19), there were interesting movies. One of them is Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.Vertigo is a word that is overly used nowadays without much meaning behind it. But it is referring to the illness suffered by the protagonist, John Ferguson (James Stewart), or Scottie as he's most often referred to as. Scottie contracted this after seeing a fellow police officer fall to his death from a rooftop when he was a cop and chasing a criminal on the rooftops. This comes into play a few times throughout the film.An old college friend of Scottie's, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) calls Scottie up one day, asking him to come out of retirement. Seems Gavin is bent on the thought that his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) is possessed by a ghost and is wandering around in a trans. He is worried she will get herself killed. Scottie sets off on his duty to watch over Madeleine and keep her safe, while trying to patch things up with his former love, Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes).Alfred Hitchcock can make a wide variety of great movies that redefine each genre they are placed in. Vertigo may be very different than Hitchcock's famous Psycho, but it should not be given any less respect. Elements of Hitchcock's famous directing are evident here.The plot is very well written and each scene is well-executed. The style of some more intense scenes is one that is rarely ever scene on film nowadays.Vertigo is a movie that can not be matched by any ridiculous remake or knock-off. Hopefully they will have the good taste to keep this movie one of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Perhaps Hitchcock's best effort,"Most critics, myself included tend to overuse the words `masterpiece' and `genius.' No adequate critique of 1958s `Vertigo' can be written without referencing the fact that the film is truly a masterpiece work from the genius director, Alfred Hitchcock.The storyline is complex in `Vertigo.' Jimmy Stewart, always one of Hitchcock's favorite actors puts on his best performance in a Hitchcock film as Scottie, a retired San Francisco detective who has vertigo brought on by a trauma that occurred on a rooftop. Scottie is reluctantly taken out of retirement when an old acquaintance played by Tom Helmore (`Secret Agent ' `The Time Machine') asks him to investigate the strange behaviors and habits of his wife, played by Kim Novak (`The Man With the Golden Arm' `Kiss Me, Stupid'.)Scottie tails the wife and is sucked into the story and of course he ends up finding the beautiful Novak irresistible. Not wanting to spoil the story for anyone who has not seen this classic I will just mention that once Stewart meets Novak the complexities and twists and turns multiply significantly.The filming is done beautifully, particularly the location shooting near the Golden Gate Bridge and the two scenes that take place at the mission south of the city. A scene where Stewart is following Novak and she parks her car in a back alley while our detective stares at her is wonderfully honored in Martin Scorsese's `Goodfellas' in a scene where Robert DeNiro tries to lure Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco) into an alley way so she can help herself to some stolen dresses  or get herself killed.Perhaps the most famous shot is the classic stairway shot filmed at the mission. Stewart has to fight his fear of heights and chase Novak up a long stairway. I am not a cinematographer, but I believe Hitchcock accomplished this by filming a Stewart going along the stairs while the camera simultaneously zoomed in on Stewart while the same camera was wheeled back and away from the subject. This creates a dizzying sense to the viewer that is meant to mimic Scotties's vertigo. Absolutely brilliant.Also fantastically brilliant in this film and the special effects and the score. A while back, a friend's husband turned me onto the world of artist Saul Bass. Bass contributed so much to the movies and is yet not known too many. Bass was an artist who designed sets, titles and visual effects like the dream sequence in `Vertigo.' If you have seen many movies from the 1950s you know that the nightmare sequence in `Vertigo' is one of the few visual effects from any movie if this era that still works for the viewer in the new millennium. Bass was perhaps best known for his work with Otto Preminger, and he also did the titles for many Scorsese movies. Bernard Herrmann (`Psycho ' `Cape Fear (both versions' `Taxi Driver') composed the chilling and compelling music for `Vertigo,' in what I think is his best work. The music from this movie is available on a soundtrack CD.Other reviewers and critics have mentioned in the past that `Vertigo' is perhaps Hitchcock's most personal film. One could only guess that Hitchcock found this story to be a somewhat cathartic experience. Stewarts somewhat kinky, perverted scenes with Novak in where he tries to convert her into the perfect woman that was the object of his desires are at the same time interesting and unsettling to the viewer.`Vertigo' also displays some great acting, particularly by James Stewart who is pretty much in front of the camera during the entire film. Through the necessities of the script Stewart had to carry the brunt of this film, and he does not disappoint. Allegedly, Kim Novak was chosen by Hitchcock for her looks (surprise, surprise) and her performance was completely controlled by Hitchcock (yet another surprise!) Barbara Bal Geddes ably portrays Stewarts long-term artist girlfriend in waiting. It is never adequately explained why she waits and why she does not seem to mind.All in all, a great piece of work from the master of suspense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

I had to watch it three times in a row on my first viewing,"This is the greatest film of all time for me...after I rented and saw the widescreen version on my first viewing, I had to watch it 3 times in a row afterwards.  I then, in the next week, showed it to 3 friends.First of all, the imagery and cinematography, notably the colors, the clothes, and the way that the actors are captured, are the best that I've EVER seen in ANY movie.Every actor portrays their role perfectly...without this, the film would have been funny...it would have collapsed.  Hitchcock truly had things in line.  The plot is ingenious and the perfect for a thriller/romance. There are a few holes that people point out but I would like to say that they almost add to the wonder of the film.James Stewart is his best...no, he isn't the typical american hero that most directors make him...in this, he is SERIOUSLY MESSED UP and it works perfectly.Kim Novak is stunning...my eyes and mind obsess over her as much as Scottie does, the point of the film for a male viewer.  Yet when watching this with a woman, watch how easily they identify with Madeleine/Judy.This film changed my life.

"too long, too slow, but worth watching","I'm not quite sure what I thought of Vertigo when I first saw it, which was a long time ago, but I recall being underwhelmed. Since it's generally considered one of Hitchcock's major works I decided I'd give it another chance.It is an odd duck.This is a prime example of Hitchcock confusing the audience by having charming, likable actors play awful people. Stewart's character is not a good guy at all, but Stewart essentially plays him as one. I could write a long list of the character's moral lapses, but Stewart doesn't play the character as a bad guy. It's an interesting approach.One thing I recall clearly from the first time I saw this movie is I thought it was very slow, and that was not a trick of the memory. Call it deliberately paced if you like, but this movie really takes its time. There is very little dialog and quite a lot of the camera watching Stewart staring at Novak.One of the oddities of the movie is that the intriguing central mystery is explained two-thirds of the way through. And yet, the film is at its most interesting in that final third. At this point the movie is simply a sad, disturbing character study powered by Novak's vulnerability.Vertigo is a very interesting movie. I imagine you could write a very long analysis of it - how its structured and character motivation and all that. But its entertainment value is iffier. Outside of Barbara Bel Geddes, whose sharp, subtle performance makes the film far more entertaining than it would otherwise be, the movie can feel a bit too vague and wandering.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitch's second best,"Vertigo, Alfred Hitchcock's wonderful study of romantic obsession and manipulation, is second only to Rear Window among his many wonderful films like Shadow of a Doubt, North by Northwest, Psycho, Rope, and The 39 Steps.This is the best Jimmy Stewart performance.  Bringing out the dark side of an actor identified with his nice guy roles was another great Hitch contribution to cinema.  This is why people who call Tom Hanks our Jimmy Stewart have no idea what they are saying.  Watch Bonfire of the Vanities if you don't believe me. His obsessive and manipulative ""Scotty"" is one of my ten faves of all time.The beautiful and enigmatic Kim Novak is a revelation. The only slight problem I have with this film is it is almost too creepy.  Hitch really confesses about his predelictions about women. A 9.5/1",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
my vote for the best of hitchcock,"all great movies must be seen at least twice to understand how great they are. that is true in spades for vertigo. the story is smart the first time through. it's brilliant the second time through. the first time through we're identifying with scotty as he tries to find out what he needs to know. our knowledge is equal to his. but we get ahead of what he knows when we hear judy write her confession letter. now we know more than scotty and our knowledge is aligned with judy. so we begin to watch scotty to see if and when he'll come to know what we and judy know. the second time through we identify with madeline/judy as she tries to keep acting her assigned part while falling in love with scotty, so we watch to see when she begis to be NOT acting the part, which is to say resisting the role she has willingly taken on. the heavy irony is that as she struggles NOT to simply play her assigned part (because she's falling in love with scotty), she in fact seems all the more convincing IN the part. and then when she is judy, to pump up the irony even more, she has to struggle to play the part of who she really is. she has to pretend to be herself. This is as masterful a setup of irony as you'll come across. what a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

breathtaking,"Surely Hitchcock's finest film, this sophisticated, dream like swirling concoction grabs you from the start of the hypnotic titles and the opening frantic roof top chase. That slight distance that can seem apparent sometimes between Hitchcock and his actors works in his favour here as we struggle to see our way through this nightmare. For me Barbara Del Geddes' 'Midge' is less satisfactory than the rest because her character seems to not have the same depth or historic connection. She seems like a child or somebody escaped from some other movie. I know her part was written in to help Stewart's character reveal the 'story so far' as you might say but her perky 'normality' and inability to convince as an 'artist' detract somewhat from the scenes at her apartment. Incidentally it always seems odd to me that Stewart seems so comfortable in this dizzyingly high dwelling with the city spread out beneath. All that said the movie is still absolutely breathtaking. The Herrmann music helps enormously but there is no doubt that Hitch has every frame of this film etched in his mind and never puts a foot wrong. We see Stewart reluctantly begin to follow Novak (in devastating form), then become more interested and then obsessed and the later scenes where his needs become more desperate are some of the most chilling in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
not casual viewing.....,"The first time I attempted to watch 'Vertigo' I fell asleep.  That was mostly because I was tired.  I made a small attempt to catch up on what I missed while I napped, and when the film ended I was not too impressed. Because of that, it has taken me some time before I decided to give this film another chance.  Thank god I did.The first thing I realized is that you have to pay attention when you watch this film because it isn't lite viewing.  The characters have a lot of depth and if you don't pay attention you might miss it.  That would be a tragedy because then you wouldn't get to fully experience the absolutely stellar performance by Novak, and the even more stellar (and extremely intense)performance of Stewart.  Their chemistry is great, and it made for a very rewarding viewing experience.The film is also quite lovely to look at.  Much like 'To Catch a Thief', the cinematography is excellent.  The sights are as much of the film as the performances.  There is also a great dream sequence, kind of like the one you would see in 'Spellbound', in comparison.  The color scheme is well defined, in the movie as well as the dream sequence, and that is a large amount of reds and greens.Of course the direction is excellent, and that is no surprise.  The first time I saw this film I hated it, the second time I loved it.  The story is simple enough, but the characters have a depth that isn't all that common in Hitchcock movies.  Usually there is mystery, but the humanity isn't always there like it is in this movie.  A visually and psychologically compelling movie that is among the best Hitchcock ever did.

For me there are no weaknesses in the film and the cast and crew were clearly all on top form when it was created. I am not interested in the politics surrounding the film as to who may have been in what part and why the film did not fare well financially, the ones who were involved should have been congratulated for a job well done. For me the film has the stamp of brilliance on it from one of the greatest directors and the end result is like velvet. I very rarely single anyone out for praise no matter how good I think the performances were but if you watch this film pay particular attention to James Stewart and Kim Novak. They are both quite breathtaking for reasons you will become aware of during the film. The directors attention to detail is one of his trademarks and as far as I can see does not short change the paying public. What the viewer sees is not what real life was like in 1958 or any other year for that matter.

A great psychological thriller by Hitchcock.,Vertigo is considered one of the finest films ever made but I have always felt it is a tad bit overrated. Don't get me wrong- This is a very good psychological film and James Stewart as the agoraphobic detective is great. The cinematography and pacing as expected from a Hitchcock film is top notch.

"A good film, but not the best one of all times","""Vertigo"" is the number 1 film of all times in the 2012 edition of the ""Sight and Sound"" critics poll (the poll appears every decade beginning with 1952). In the ""Sight and Sound"" directors poll the film is number 7 on the list.In ""Vertigo"" Hitchcock applies one of his favourite story telling techniques. Somewhat after halfway of the film he reveals to the audience the hidden truth, while his main protagonist remains totally ignorant. Curious enough this does not work as a spoiler. The tension of the film remains , but only takes on a different character. One asks himself no longer what the truth is, but if and how the main character will discover it.The theme of ""Vertigo"" is the restyling of a living woman after the example of a dead woman. This is also the theme of ""Rebecca"" (1940, Alfred Hitchcock), but the two films couldn't be more different. In ""Rebecca"" the ""force"" behind the restyling comes from the house where the dead lady used to live, and especially from its repesentative the main housekeeper Mrs Danvers. ""Rebecca"" is a haunted house genre film. In ""Vertigo"" the ""force"" behind the restyling comes from a man's sexual fantasies and desires.

One of the Great Cinematic Tragedies,"Let's not beat around the bush: ""Vertigo"" is one of the greatest tragedies in cinema history from one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.

It's also a film that so perfectly captures the golden age of Hollywood: it's rife with glorious 50s melodrama, saturated with beautiful Technicolor, the costumes are extravagantly designed, and it features a soundtrack so earnest and melancholy it practically begs the viewer to shed a tear. ""Vertigo"" is a film that has inspired generations of filmmakers and will continue to inspire them.

How Miss Deep Freeze (Novak) Became Scottie's Made-To-Order Barbie Doll,"(Spoilers? Maybe)Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (?) - Strictly a case of possession-obsession - A deadly disturbing portrait of an All-American man, his mounting madness, and Judy's beauty parlor make-over from hell.OK. So, if the occasion offered itself, how would you expect an average American male to deal with the golden opportunity (like a gift from the gods) of being able to re-invent the woman of his dreams, who, already presumed dead, was also the ultimate love of his life?Well, if you were supposedly ""normal"" like Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo, then you'd simply mold her, shape her, and torment her. Through the ruthlessness of intimidation, domination and humiliation you'd repeatedly trample on her feelings until she finally succumbed to your will and became a living replica of the frickin' Barbie doll of your warped fantasy. Yeah. That's what you'd do.Of all the Hitchcock films that I've seen over the years, I'd certainly rank Vertigo as my least favorite, by far. When you carefully look below the surface of things in this one, not only can you smell the reek of misogyny, but you also get the stink of one of the most vile and unpalatable character studies (of an apparently ""normal"" American male, in the form of Scottie Ferguson) that you are ever going to see.I personally found Scottie to be an even bigger monster than, say, Norman Bates from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".I mean, at least we all knew well-enough that Norman wasn't ""normal"" and so that, in a sense, rendered the horrid acts that he committed as somewhat (Remember, I said ""somewhat"") acceptable.But, on the other hand, there was Scottie who was undoubtedly presented as being about the most ""normal"" male alive in America. And, yet, his final actions belied his normalcy, 'cause when it came to re-inventing Judy into his beloved Madeleine, Scottie clearly crossed well-over the fine line of sanity and stepped straight into a madness of the most obsessively dangerous in nature.Scottie's actions were so clearly that of a bona-fide psycho. So much so that, in a sense, he ended up killing Madeleine, not once, but twice. And if that ain't crazy, then I don't know what is.As slow-paced as Vertigo initially was at the start, all-in-all, it was a fairly intriguing Mystery/Thriller that worked fine up to about the half-way point. Then once Madeleine was ""killed"" for the first time, things quickly deteriorated into one of the most morbid and thoroughly tasteless obsessions involving a memory of the dead and a feeble attempt at its subsequent resurrection.Trivia note - Actor James Stewart, who played Scottie, was 50 at the time. Kim Novak, who played Madeleine/Judy, was only 25. From my point of view, this huge age gap alone didn't help matters much when trying to pass these 2 off as believable on-screen lovers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The kind of film that improves with a second viewing...,"An artful mixture of romance, suspense, atmosphere and mood make 'Vertigo' a stunning film to watch and experience. Bernard Herrmann's almost mystical score accentuates the feel of the story, giving it a kind of dreamlike quality--sometimes nightmarish, depending on the events unfolding. Probably no Hitchcock film ever made better use of a scenic locale with its San Francisco setting making a perfect backdrop for the story. It starts slowly but as the mood of obsession and the ""other world"" quality of the story takes shape, your senses sharpen and you want to see how it all turns out. James Stewart and Kim Novak are perfect in the leads. I have only one reservation--I am not a fan of Barbara Bel Geddes' stagey style of acting and found her a jarring minor note in the story. The clever plot with a surprise ending is one of Hitch's best works--a richly satisfying experience and a beautiful film to watch. Will have you wanting to view it again for a deeper exploration of its twists and turns.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Masterpiece of cinema that is still unequalled!,"Well, what can one say that has not already been said about this undisputed Hitchcock masterwork. Having watched most of the Master's films post-Rope, I had contented myself that North By Northwest would never be beaten, until I clapped eyes on this strange, neurotic, surreal, romantic, haunting drama. Never before in the cinema has there been a story that could wrench at the heart and leave the viewer shaken by its power. Stewart, the one-time All-American Hero of Capra, gives his greatest screen performance as the admittedly sickly minded cop smitten with the mysterious Kim Novak, who never again would get a role this good. Both stars exhume passion, almost burning the celluloid of the print, and Hitch never once loses focus of the story. His surprise revelation of the plot about 2 thirds of the way in may destroy the suspense but it increases the tension in the viewer. HE doesn't know her real identity and SHE only wants him to love her for who she is, not because he is in love with a dead woman who transfixed him. For me the final thirty minutes are probably the most poignant moments the screen has to offer. When the film ends, the viewer is shattered by the tragedy, but goes away enriched with what the cinema can offer, but cannot even come close to achieving again. For me, Vertigo is the best film I have ever seen and, no matter how many times I see it, I still come away with the same reaction - goosebumps and a lump in the throat. Cinema alchemy on a grand scale and Hitch is king of directors!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
to know it is to love it,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece, with both heart and deep, cynical intelligence. Of course it's contrived. that's part of the joke. It's the most beautiful and romantic film ever, but has an utterly black heart. That's why, like the ups and downs of the human heart, it's as much comic as it is tragic. The ending is perfect precisely because it is such a cop-out, leaving us as (and Scotty) just as stranded over the abyss as we were at the beginning. To love this movie you have to understand it. And if you don't, well, go watch North By Northwest with the other children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Alfred Hitchcock's magnum opus,"Alfred Hitchcock was a creative genius, he was able to play his audience like a piano. Few people have done so much developing the cinematic language as Alfred Hitchcock, he had so many experimental and original ideas, like shooting one film in one long uncut shot, (Rope) or having the whole film take place in one room. (Rear Window) But his greatest contribution to film is easily Vertigo, and Vertigo is one of the best films ever made.Vertigo is about a retired detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson (played by Hitchcock favorite, Jimmy Stewart in probably his second best performance), who has a crippling fear of heights after a near death experience. One day Scottie is contacted by an old friend of his, this friend is the head of a major shipping company, and hires Scottie to follow his wife. Not because he suspects her of cheating, he makes that very clear to Scottie, but because she has been acting strange going out on long drives and then not being able to tell him were she went. Scotties friends wife, Madeleine Elster, is played by Kim Novak, who does on excellent job as a classic Hitchcock blonde. As Scottie continues to investigate this strange case, he discovers an unsettling story as he falls in love with her.Vertigo is based of a French novel called, D'Entre Les Mortes, or The Living and the Dead, written by Boileau-Narcejac the French writing collaboration, that wrote the book that the film Les Diaboliques, and wrote the screen play for the film Eyes Without A Face, both of which are fantastic films that I highly recommend you check out, but neither of those are as mind-blowing as Vertigo. The story structure is very similar, but what gives Vertigo its edge is Hitchcock's flawless direction, he knows how to perfectly direct the cast, and control what the audience is seeing.But Hitchcock is not the only one who knocks it out of the park in Vertigo, Vertigo is a tour de force, every single member of the cast and crew is giving the best they got, the cinematography done by Robert Burks (who collaborated with Hitchcock several times) is mind-blowing and even invented the famous ""Vertigo shot."" The score done by Bernard Hermann (who scored some of the best films of all time like Citizen Kane, and Taxi Driver) may just be the greatest film score ever, I highly recommend you listen to it separate from the film some time because it can stand on its own, but even with how great the score is, Hitchcock was smart enough to not use it in certain scenes, like climax, it would just be an unneeded edition.As the film progresses the audience begins to learn about why Madeleine Elster acts the way she does, the more disturbing the film becomes, I won't spoil what's going on, but it is incredibly creepy and executed in such a way that it is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. Probably the scariest part in the film is a montage, dream sequence that takes place 2/3s of the way through the film, this dream sequence gave me nightmares the first time I saw it, and still does every time I re-watch Vertigo.When you talk about ""the greatest films of all time"" Vertigo is often mentioned in that conversation. And in the 2012 sight & sound poll (the best film poll in my opinion) Vertigo kicked Citizen Kane out of the first place spot, this is the first time this has happened in the 60 years that the poll has been taking place. And while I don't think it's better than Citizen Kane it's hard to get mad when it's replaced with such a great, influential, important film.This whole review I've been struggling to put just how good Vertigo is, into words. But I don't think anyone ever could. It's a film that is so very deep, complex, and original that you would need to go through the whole film shot by shot, frame by frame, (Roger Ebert actually did this) before you could really describe it. No matte how many times you watch you will always discover something new about it. It is a film that feels like you're watching it for the first time, every time you re-watch it. Vertigo is one of those films that I wish I could give an 11/10, but unfortunately IMDb doesn't give me that option, so I guess I won't.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Superb,"Vertigo is the ultimate film.  It is my favorite film and in my opinion should have been rated much higher in the AFI's top 100 movies of all time list.  It outdoes Psycho and North By Northwest even though those are superb films as well.  I realize that Psycho set standars for years to come, and North By Norhtwest set standards for script-wrting, directorial techniques, etc....but Vertigo was simply a masterpeice made.  Nothing was revolutionized (except Hitch's technique of falling bodies), but instead a wonderful movie was made that can show just how much the human mind can toy with feelings and emotions.  Not only is the cinematography and acting remarkable in this film, but the heart-breaking score by the great Bernard Herrmann would also have to be the high point in this film.  When you listen to the score, you feel all the emotions that are running through the film and through the charachters head.  Never before could this have been expressed in a film, and it has never been done again in film.  There have been many attempts and superb films as well that have tried to express the same emotions--but none have succeeded more then Vertigo.  This was Alfred Hitchcocks personal favorite of his own--and I do not blame him.  All elements come together:  James Stewart and Kim Novak's electrifying performances, Bernard Herrmann's legendary score, the superb scenery of San Francisco, and the love and passion expressed through the chracters by a remarkable script.  The thing to top off Vertigo is the scene where Judy comes out of the bathroom and reveals herself as this illusion woman (Madeline).  There is so much passion in this scene it truly has to be one of the most remarkable scenes in the history of film.  When one takes all these elements into hand, Vetigo can without a doubt be considered one of the 3, if not the greatest, movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"People say beauty is in the inside. In Vertigo, it's everywhere","Apparently there's a reason why, in a medium where everything is extremely subjective, this film is always on the top for so many people. If I'm allowed to say, it is truly objectively a masterpiece. Usually when I watch a movie there is always that one scene that sticks with me afterwards. A few minutes in, the scene at Ernie's kicks in and I think to myself: This is it. But then there's the whole pursuit scene, the museum, the nightmare sequence, the final transformation of Judy in Madeleine, and so on, and so on. Everything is so beautifully engineered to elevate the tantalization of Madeleine that one can't help to participate in Scottie's obsession. James Stewart is stellar, as usual, but Kim Novak can just merge an uneasy eerie feel with that strong magnetism, while still keeping it convincingly real. And of course it had to come to that end. After all, life goes in cycles, right? All of this the fruit of an extremely well designed plot by the one and only Master of Suspense. Let him take the credit he deserves, but don't forget that the man surrounded himself with the right people. The cinematography by Robert Burks is, to this day, the closest I have seen to the meaning of ""every frame a painting"". I mean, I had never realized I wanted so badly to visit San Francisco (which almost feels like character in itself). And don't get me started one the score. Many say that, since Herrmann couldn't conduct the orchestra in this movie, it doesn't have the same feel. But honestly, it doesn't really matter to me. It is so well embedded into the plot, the characters, the scenery, that, just like the city of San Francisco, feels like a conscious character. Most of the times, this may go unnoticed to a great deal of people, but I dare anyone to try to watch this movie with no soundtrack and I assure you it won't be nearly as striking.""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere""",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Didn't click for me,"I don't expect much from Hitchcock, so it's obvious that this picture would be the same. It seems Hitchcock is always ending his movies in a cliffhanger or a mindf*uk. But in this particular movie it doesn't seem to fit in, I can imagine the plot of the movie happening in another movie and it would be the same, nothing special or shocking. Also the acting was exaggerated. On a personal note: I'm not a fan of Hitchcock so I wasn't expecting to enjoy much but I still tried to watch the movie and see if I can appreciate this director but it seems that even if I understand the plot and the ending, I just don't love the movie nor the director. I guess Hitchcock is just not my type. The only lesson I can learn from him is ""the bomb under the table"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"More style than substance, even for Hitchcock.","Vertigo has to be one of Hitch's most analyzed films. But ""the master of suspense"" offers more style than substance here, leaving the viewer with nothing but vertigo. The swirling opening credits, the hypnotic soundtrack, the dream-like pastel look, the unusual grey tone of wardrobe and back-drops. Is Hitch trying a Douglas Sirk (director of a number of stylistic melodramas of the 1950s) with all this stuff? Then going a little deeper, are we made as obsessed by Madeleine (Kim Novak) by seeing James Stewart's character trailing her on foot and by car for much of the film, with NO suspense or drama? We have to be, or it doesn't work. It didn't for me. (NO SPOILERS) In what might be called the second half there is a moment when we are made aware of something. You'll have to decide if this is shown too soon, as it was for me. Also, why would the husband want to kill a wife that looked liked Kim Novak in the first place? How does Stewart's character survive his fall (not shown) from a tall building, receiving only a broken leg? Didn't others see changes in Madeleine?

Like a Greek drama, Scotty is pushed towards the cliff, there being no turning back.Don´t ask me how but there is a surrealistic touch to this film that keeps the audience in suspense from the start (the music is wonderful).If you were to see only one more film in your life, Vertigo is it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Bernard Hermann has received a lot of justified praise for his score.  It is mesmerizing and beautiful.  It stands alone, yet works stunningly in the film.  The cinematography is also great.

Hitch works wonders with this material.,"This tantalizing, intense, dreamy thriller is considered by some to be Alfred Hitchcocks' finest hour. It moves slowly, but at the same time it's absolutely hypnotic. Helped to a great extent by one of Bernard Herrmanns' best scores, Hitch and his excellent cast pull you right in and take you on a memorable journey. It's simply one of the best studies in obsession that this viewer has seen in a motion picture. Hitch begins the tale in high style, creating a LOT of potent atmosphere and a touching romance. His visuals are among his most innovative, with an incredible nightmare sequence devised by John Ferren.James Stewart is very likable as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a police detective who has a traumatic experience after which he realizes that he's deathly afraid of heights. While recuperating, he meets up with an old school chum, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin is worried about the mental state and behaviour of his young wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), and hires Scottie to shadow her and see what she gets up to. Scottie falls in love with the beautiful blonde, and becomes determined to help her face whatever demons are haunting her.""Vertigo"" is one of those stories that works better the less the prospective viewer knows about the plot, so this viewer will refrain from rehashing any more of it. Suffice it to say, this devastating entertainment comes up with some pretty sharp twists and turns. The character of Scottie completely earns ones' sympathies, from beginning to end.Novak seems awfully aloof for a while, but while this story plays out, her performance starts looking better and better. Barbara Bel Geddes leads a strong supporting cast (Henry Jones, Raymond Bailey, Ellen Corby, Konstantin Shayne, Lee Patrick, Paul Bryar) as she plays the role of Midge, Scotties' loyal companion who still carries a torch for him.I've heard it said that ""Vertigo"" only gets better with subsequent viewings, so I'm already looking forward to revisiting at some point in the future.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece?,"**** out of ****On your first viewing of Vertigo, by the time you've reached the final sequence, you may have already forgotten how you and the film's characters arrived at that point.

James Stewart is great, as usual, as a happy go lucky booze-hound/psychologically unsound retired detective and Kim Novak is also great in dual roles. What else can I tell you without giving away too much? Oh, yes, it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and it might be his best film. Also, Bernard Herrmann's creepy, romantic score compliments each sequence. The special effects were revolutionary and top notch for their time, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Not as great as they say but fun to watch,"Vertigo is a mystery film in the late 50s that has a way of luring you in till you become hooked to see how it is all going to turn out.I love the nice twist in the ending that makes you know that all that you are watching is just a setup that is if you have not read the book prior to watching this classic.Although many a classics have been made, Vertigo has received many praises which I believe it does not deserve. Viewers may be bored by the lengthy drama, but if you are the kind that loves to see how it is going to turn out, then Vertigo is a movie for you.The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who had to retire due to disabilities (vertigo and clinical depression) incurred when a police colleague died trying to save him.Scottie gets a call from an old friend who hires him as a private investigator to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is behaving strangely.Scottie begins the job which led to him falling in love and becoming obsessed with his work.The screenplay is an adaptation of the French novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.Although Vertigo is fun to watch, it may be a bore at times and has so many loose ends.

Far-fetched,"You probably don't want to take my word for it, but in spite of good acting, good cinematography, good music score, I found the ""reveal"" too far-fetched, and the coincidences highly unlikely.

The biggest mystery is how did this film become so highly rated?,"I am a big fan of Hitchcock but how this hits the high ratings is a bigger mystery than the film itself. The first 20 minutes or so give's you an indication that its going to be another classic. Sadly, like me you will be wrong.If you are looking to watch your first Hitchcock film to see what all the fuss is about then don't watch this. The directing of the film isn't I suppose the problem but the story has the excitement factor of a roller coaster climbing slowly slowly for over an hour, levelling out for 20 minute's before hitting a few promising bumps which will then lead you to being chucked off with nothing more than whiplash from your chin hitting your chest as you continuously nod off.Without going into detail or being a spoiler, this film laboriously drags out with a retired detective (James Stuart) being paid to follow his friend's wife(Kim Novak)employed by the friend himself as he has concerns for his wife's mental stability due to strange reasons.All the obvious things happen boy/detective meets girls sort of stuff and you will begin to build your theory of what's going to happen which may or may not be correct, but you wont care either way as disappointment will set in long before the end.If you do manage to stay awake to catch the ending be prepared to shake your head, re-write it your self and wonder why you didn't listen to me and save your self a few hours in the first place. I suppose their is a twist which you would expect, but theirs not enough depth to the mystery to make it worthwhile.I advice if you intend to watch this film from start to finish indulge with ample amounts of caffeine and be prepared to shut out the whiny music that begins to annoy.In my opinion not one of his finest hours as you may of gathered, nor a must see film.I do hope people don't give films good ratings for the Hitchcock factor as a film should be rated on more than its branded logo.

Now I am 18 and studying Film and Media at university, I can appreciate why it had such an effect.

Love madness by A.H.,"I was only a child when I saw Vertigo for the first time, and I can remember that I was very disappointed. I was very fond of Hitchcock's films by that time, mainly because of its marvelous stories about people in dangerous situations and the thrilling things that happened to them, and that's what I thought Vertigo was going to be. But after all I found it rather boring, perhaps because I didn't understand Scottie´s attitude.However, now I´m a few years older, I see Vertigo (and many other Hitchcock's movies) with different eyes. Detective plot is the subject which I am less concerned inside them (though I keep a high interest), and love affair is now what makes me think that these pictures are really special.Nobody ever gave us such a romantic sight of loving obsession for a dead woman as Hitch did with Vertigo, and I have never seen such a touching ""amour fou"" tale. And  that's the reason which turns Vertigo into an unforgettable and unique film and differentiates it from other works by the same author, like Notorious or Rebecca. Vertigo's psychological depth is probably only reached by Hitchcock with Marnie, another non-conventional romance.In addition to that we can enjoy the wonderful performances of Jimmy Stewart (progressively out of his usual role of prudent man as the story moves forward) and Kim Novak (better actress than what some people think and perhaps the most beautiful woman I have seen on a screen).But Vertigo is one more thing: it's a film about a city. San Francisco was never so well portrayed (those hills, those neighborhoods, those houses...), and many of us have learned to love it starting from this picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"In my limited experience as a film viewer, I consi...","In my limited experience as a film viewer, I consider this the best movie I have ever seen.  The movie takes a while to get going- after the first couple of viewings, I can fast forward or do a crossword puzzle for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie without worrying about missing anything spectacular, but once it does, it soars.  The performances are wonderful, especially James Stewart, who is mesmerizing as the haunted detective. Hitchcock, almost always a master with the camera, supports the acting with wondrous shots that add to the mystery of the movie.  While some have criticized the movie for a lack of mystery, I believe they miss the point. The mystery of the movie is the relationship between Stewart and Novak, not any particular plot element.  Without giving away the plot, let's just say the viewer is allowed to understand what is going on before the climax, but I think that heightens the interest in how the Stewart/Novak characters will play out their roles in this psychological drama.  This movie is not exactly the feel-good hit of the summer, as it is painted in very dark colors. The movie's essence is about guilt, self-hatred, and a quest for redemption that spills over into obsession.  That is why, even though the ""mystery"" in the plot is revealed before the end of the movie, that becomes incidental to what is really being discussed by Hitchcock.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't care for psychological dramas, just for the Bernard Hermann score.

Just misses being a masterpiece,"I know that many people consider this Hitchcock's masterpiece, and some consider it the greatest film of all time.  True, it has many elements of a masterpiece.  It is a major mood piece.  The sad, elegaic melancholy is sustained throughout, thanks largely to Bernard Hermann's score.  The acting is first rate, even by Novak.  The color is masterful.  All this having been said, why then do I say that this just misses being a masterpiece.  Because, to me, the film has a serious flaw which mars the film, although it doesn't destroy it.  The flaw occurs in the scene that occurs about halfway through the film, after Madeline has been dead for a year, when Scotty meets Judy Barton, also played by Novak.  After Scotty brings her back to her hotel room and says goodnight, Judy begins an internal monologue, accompanied by a visual flashback, that gives away the whole plot.  After this, there is no more suspense!  The viewer knows something that Scotty doesn't.  Wouldn't it have been far better for the viewer to have been kept in suspense as well and find out the truth at the same time Scotty does.  If you don't believe me, watch the film again and fast forward past this scene, and see if it isn't an improvement.  Otherwise, a masterpiece.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"""I heard voices""--an innocent statement for a great end","Hitchcock films end with interesting statements. Vertigo ends with a nun blandly stating ""I heard voices."" Then, the bell is tolled. Hitchcock loves to play with words and sounds to stir up the imagination of the viewer. Even when letters are written, Hitchcock, instead of showing the words as a conventional director would, he prefers to let the writer speak out the words that are being written.This is an unusual Hitchcock film where humor is hardly present-instead the psychological atmosphere of the film is full of regret, gloom and doom, with death lurking everywhere, while the camera captures the opposite feelings-bright sunny exteriors, lush green dresses, green cars, red robes, spotless white coats. The film harks back to Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" in subject and treatment as it explores the inherent contradictions in life.Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"" is adapted by Bernard Herrmann, the music composer, for ""Vertigo"" in a very effective score that is not far removed from original piece.I look forward to viewing the film in 70 mm (its new form). This is a fascinating Hitchcock film in lush color with a great ending--but there are equally stunning Hitchcock films that did not rely on color. ""Notorious,"" ""Saboteur,"" and ""Blackmail"" are three Hitchcock films where ""black and white"" was equally stunning as the color in ""Vertigo.""
However, few minor details bother me--the actual, murder is never shown on screen and the escape of Judy and Gavin from the church tower is difficult to believe, (it is also not shown).

The fear of heights aspect of the film almost seems like an afterthought in comparison.I've gotta be honest, ""Vertigo"" did not agree with me. The first act is tedious; the performances are overly dramatic; and the ending feels like slamming into a brick wall: way too abrupt. What really strikes me odd is that the most interesting person here is Barbara Bel Geddes, and she's as ancillary as they get.The film's sterling reputation isn't lost on me; it's a stone classic and near critic-proof.

"Where are you now, Madeleine?","This was one of the first films I watched that made an impression on me. I doubt that I was even a teenager when, one evening, this was on TV. It had me compelled throughout, and the conclusion, well, perfection itself. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. I'm now 23, and I finally got a copy of it. As Leonard Maltin put it, this demands multiple viewings; there is too much to take in all at once. This is a psychological thriller about love and obsession. Hitchcock delivers a layered and personal picture(and what may be his best, this or Psycho), and not only do we find ourselves wondering and following this intently, we become as ensnared as Scottie and Alfred. We can neither entirely distance ourselves from it nor condone it. Novak truly is *stunning*, and her performance is very good. Yes, there is an age difference, but they are great together. It is an unusual role for Stewart; this increases the effect, and he is rather convincing. There is suspense(he definitely was the master) and tension right from the opening credits(!). The lighting and sets are amazing, and there are several unforgettable visuals, if the editing and cinematography of this isn't overall as memorable as others by the same director. Dialog is clever, well-delivered and funny when it means to be. The score is powerful, with a little supernatural touch to it, for self-explanatory reasons. Pace is gradual. The plot is well-written, if it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny; this is about the select few characters. There is a bit of disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(that goes back and forth, it is ""assembled"" from different people talking about it. Among them is a producer from back then and two people who restored the movie, and they talk about every aspect of it), a featurette that I will review on its own individual page here on the site and two trailers, totalling at 3 and a half minutes, that spoil some of this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine liking it... and please treat yourself to more than one exposure to it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Unbelievable,"Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958) is generally regarded as one of Hitch's greatest movies ever and for good reason.  This movie has it all--great costumes and hairstyles by Edith Head, outstanding musical score by the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, incredible acting performances by James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes, and of course flawless directing by Hitchcock.  I really don't want to talk about the plot of the movie, but I will say it is a very complex but interesting one.  I read somewhere that Hitch wasn't really satisfied with Kim Novak's performance, but I can't see why.  Maybe it was the perception of her back then as a sex symbol ala Marilyn Monroe.  Her dual character role is one of the toughest to perform in all of the Hitch's movies.  The only one that can compare is the role of Marnie.  She is fantastic.  I love watching this movie more and more and I can't get enough of the music.  Do yourself a favor--if you have never seen this movie, go rent it now.  You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Mere cinema,"""Vertigo"" is,first of all,a movie of great themes (loneliness,arduous desire,humiliation,twisted psychologies,a certain kind of bashfulness,then a shameless exploitation and domineering force,and instincts,and submission).Hitchcock liked his movies to be amusing and exciting and wonderful and accomplished,and he could not conceive an art deprived of exciting and thrilling, suspenseful elements,and this is a matter of artistic temperament,some people are made to be able to like an art that is amusing and exciting (Balzac, Villiers, Barbey,Poe, Wells were such men);it is Hitchcock's merit to give this aesthetic frame a powerful content.The thriller,the popular epic become the natural context of his films.Vertigo (1958),The Birds (1963),Marnie (1964),The Trouble with Harry (1955) are movies that display themes of so vast a scope.These are films that add to Hitchcock's characters and reactions several strong situations that show life's hidden texture.""Vertigo"" is beautiful in an amazing way.A movie of an ampleness and heartfelt content and unequaled,powerful visual beauty;the entire film has a dream-like note,and a surreal seizing of the appetizing beauty,in women,flowers,dresses,etc..If there ever was a surrealistic movie,then Vertigo (1958) is that.In a certain sense,Marnie (1964) is the contrary,the aesthetic opposite of Vertigo (1958).It is a big mistake to blame or to praise ""Vertigo"" for its plot;I have read people who admired ""Vertigo"" for its plot,and I've seen some who despised it for its plot,and,for sometime,I myself did not like ""Vertigo""'s plot,that is,its mystery film content.But ""Vertigo"",maybe the best movie ever made,and certainly the most beautiful, cannot be evaluated on the mystery film's level.""Vertigo"" is about some strong situations (humiliation,loneliness,love,beauty),and about some equally strong and thrilling reactions;and Hitchcock's beautiful characters,although cultivated,urbane,chic,intelligent,educated people,have always a certain note of directness and volitional energy;people that have something primary,basic,plain,somehow selfish and instinctual,and also natural.""Vertigo"" is the peak of the mere cinema. There are Stewart's unexpected pulsations of brutality,that of a man compelled by desires from ...,and some scenes of an appalling cruelty,that remind of Marnie (1964) and even Frenzy (1972) and Rope (1948) (Hitchcock's most brutal and cruel films),by their psychological intensity.In ""Vertigo""'s second part,Mrs. Novak is a humiliated woman,a torn one,as heart-broken Stewart' s dementia devastates their lives.Hitchcock gave James Stewart progressively better and ampler roles,from Rope (1948) to Rear Window (1954) and to Vertigo (1958).In each of these movies,Stewart is never required to retake his role from a previous film,but instead to shape a different one.In the last one, Stewart's character is a lonely man,a vulnerable one,and there are,in Mrs. Bel Geddes' silences,in Stewart's ingenuity and candor (in his scenes with the tight-lipped Mrs. Bel Geddes,when he takes up their failed engagement),even his faint that turns into a ""pieta"",some very touching intuitions and insights. As in Marnie (1964),as in The Birds (1963) or The Trouble with Harry (1955),these people's past hides frightful things,things of solitude,silences,etc..""Vertigo"" is a movie so intense,so well-grounded,and vast,and meaningful,and sharp,and of immediacy in the joy it gives,of well-marked outlines.When I say that ""Vertigo"" is a jewel,in fact:the whole cinema's jewel,I do not mean that it is ornamental;on the contrary.But it is one of the few films that are,in their entirety,visions. And where Clouzot was of a gruesome realism,Hitchcock is visionary.As an act of courage,""Vertigo"" is unmatched,even when you are Hitchcock himself it takes courage to be that great,and this may be,I think,one of the reasons we all have to cherish the obese ""bonhomme"".First of all,""Vertigo"" is a film of a very sensuous and immediate charm and beauty.It is also a story of fineness and distinction.This movie elicits in me awe.A few more notes:(1)in Hitchcock's movies,there are dreadful silent things,never spoken of (as:the loneliness,the failure),and,above them,or on top of them,there is the funny,caustic conversation,the wit, etc.;(2)""Vertigo"" is a film of mere charm,and,against the misconception of a ""popular"" and ""common"" Stewart,Hitchcock broke,here,this cliché (as he did in Rope (1948) and in Rear Window (1954) also!!),giving Stewart a cool and distinguished appearance);as a matter of fact,the only Alfred Hitchcock film where Stewart got a common and popular air is The Man Who Knew Too Much,1956!;it is not true that Hitchcock wanted Stewart as a representative of the common type,on the contrary.Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques was a movie of chilling realism,while Hitchcock's film is a piece of gorgeous,surreal and funeral beauty,and also of psychological depth and of delightful charm. Clouzot's and Hitchcock's geniuses could not differ more,or be more opposite.Hail them both!If you really want to measure and seize Stewart's art scope,watch him in his scenes with Mrs. Bel Geddes;they tear the heart.There are splendid impressionistic touches in ""Vertigo"".The film is gorgeous and delightful,and vividly colored.Its theme is paradoxical: the pain and humiliation there are in the beauty.Hitchcock's work is lavish,resplendent,amazing,of vigorous beauty,while Clouzot's film aforementioned was of sober,minimalist conception,an imperishable masterpiece of sardonic,grueling realism.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"SUSPENSE, SURPRISE and SUBSTANCE.......the work of the Master Of SUSPENSE - the unmatched classic, 'Vertigo'","Arguably the greatest Director in world cinema history, Alfred Hitchcock could very well have single handedly changed the face of the horror and thriller genres forever. His influence on cinema - his technique and style in particular - have inspirationally spawned countless copy cats, most famous of which have been the likes of John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. He instilled famous images in our heads - images that will scare future generations of showers, birds, ropes and airplanes. Many wouldn't even know he has done so. His films are instantly recognizable around the world. What is most fascinating, is that he could overwhelm you with suspense without much to it, for he didn't need blood, gore or very loud music to get the audience scared, because it was the timing, subtle camera movements, use of light and the extraordinary music that made audiences around the world tremble. Hitchcock's vision set standards much like David Lean set it for the epic scope and John Huston for adventure - much like Spielberg and Lucas would set it for the imagination. 'Vertigo' is the perfect example of his gift to the world. It is his masterful and complete compilation of the standards that people recognize him by.It is about a San Fransisco Private Eye named Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) who following a police chase, where his partner falls to his death off a building, develops a fear of heights and is forced to retire. To his surprise, he is one day approached by an old friend from school who begs him to investigate the strange happenings of his wife Madelaine who he claims is possessed by some ghost. Initially hesitating, Scottie soon is personally drawn to Madelaine's situation, following her around San Fransisco. However, nothing prepares him for what lies ahead when lust, deception, conspiracy and murder unravel in a complex plot, in which he is determined to find the truth.I believe 'Vertigo' was Hitchock's definitive master work, because none captured his brilliant touch quite like it. Everything that you could throw into a suspenseful thriller was in it. Above all the story was the most engaging. The actors were flawless. The music and cinematography were splendid. None captured the essence of 'fear' as powerfully as it did. It is in my opinion a PERFECT film. From start to finish, you can't take your eyes off the screen. 'James Stewart' is perhaps the most mesmerizing and commanding presence ever to grace the silver screen. You could feel his anger, excitement, fear and sadness through his famous eyes and gestures. The scenery of San Fransisco was magnificent and truly added to the already overwhelming atmosphere Hitchcock is famous for. Music was never over indulgent and suited incredibly well with the happenings on-screen.What really impresses me is that few films have had as many plot twists and turns that 'Vertigo' showcases. You would learn something new every time you'd watch it. None have such an engaging plot as does this beautiful, atmospheric Mona Lisa of a film.Recommendations are useless. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW if you haven't done so. Forget about our contemporary film directors that excite you. No film in my opinion excites quite like Hitchcock's definitive masterpiece 'Vertigo'. It has everything you could hope for. This is a classic in every meaning of the word and should be a definite addition to everyone's video library.Hitchcock...........we miss you.....................forever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The director of this is Ed Wood!,"Vertigo is considered a masterpiece yet I found it one of the most boring movies ever. The reason is very simple. There is one thing missing: ""cinema"".Those opening credits are terribly annoying with something continuously spinning. The movie is slow, so slow that I have the impression of watching a school play. The direction is amateurish, with no style at all. Flat. Technically poor. That camera doesn't move. Rouben Mamoulian way back in 1932 (Dr. Jekyll) was 10 times more fancy whilst movie making was just at dawn.The actors are either plastered or made of wood. Kim Novak has a terrible make-up. The events and the story are absolutely improbable.The movie is old, obsolete, tedious but on the other hand it is so nice & clean and self-satisfied! The result? It is even more unbearable.Forget about those panoramic scenes. It is my impression that for at least a couple of them they were filmed indoor with the actors standing in front of a screen.Other terrible things: I didn't know if I had to laugh or cry when James Stewart was about to faint after standing on a chair (Vertigo!) The scene of Stewart jumping in the bay to fetch someone that fell in it is so poorly filmed that even a kid could have come up with something better.No, I do not like Hitchcock.

don't look down,"You understand ""Vertigo"" better once you know the word's definition. It refers specifically to dizziness, not acrophobia as some people mistakenly believe. Dizziness plays a major role in the movie. Jimmy Stewart plays San Francisco Det. John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who gets uncomfortable in high places. Hired to follow Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), he rescues her from drowning. As he stays with her more and more, he begins to suspect something strange about her. It all comes to a head at the San Juan Bautista Mission, when she jumps off of the bell tower. Scottie feels guilty, but some questions remain unanswered. Just who is that woman whom Scottie sees in the museum? Why does she look exactly like Madeleine? And how does a Spanish woman who lived almost 100 years earlier relate to all this? The spirals are an eye-opening aspect. Not only the opening credits, but also Scottie's acrophobia, and the staircase in the bell tower. As is often the case in Alfred Hitchcock's movies, the lighting tells part of the story; in this case, a sign outside the apartment illuminates Madeleine and her dress.The San Juan Bautista Mission is not an accident. Hitchcock was raised Roman Catholic, so it makes sense that he might want to use such an institution. But the movie's final scene - which happens at the Mission - seems to be a metaphor for things coming back to haunt people.And of course, Kim Novak was one of Hitchcock's ""icy blondes"", in the same category as Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Eva Marie Saint, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren. All I can tell you further is that there is a scene in which Madeleine is next to a window, and you see her reflection; that appears to be foreshadowing.All very vertiginous.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Keep rewatching it,"There are some films that you somehow don´t like and that you watch every time they are on TV. For me Vertigo is a prime example. It is easy to see what is fascinating: the music by Herrmann the face of Jim Stewart the great sub plot with the down-to-earth friend Mitch played brilliantly by Barbara Bel-Geddes. (When I first saw it as an adult at the beginning of the eighties dozens of people started whispering ""Miss Ellie"" when she had her first scene.) Why did she end the engagement when she obviously still loves him? The thought of recreating your lost loved one. But at the same time the film is overlong (which is an euphemism for boring). You seem to see Stewart behind a wheel all the time. The plot seems to be too constructed. There is no hint of why in the world Judy should go through everything. Why not confess to John? So she started to love him only later? Why in the world should someone push a puppet down the staple? (Well, that was the troubling thought I had when I first saw the film as a kid. There should be a law against kids watching great movies. They have fun enough being kids and it spoils  the films for them when they watch them later.) Anyway I will watch it again and find out what makes this one ultimately a masterpiece or what it is that makes one think it might be one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

At the request of an acquaintance, he puts his detective skills to use on a strange case. The specifics of the complex plot should not be spoiled, but this is a story of obsession.Kim Novak's performance is a tour de force that requires her to convince the viewer that she is playing multiple roles at the same time.Bernard Hermann's score is predictably stellar. It combines with the cinematography, effects, and all elements of style to create a cohesive whole that plays on the viewer's emotions. Note especially the use of color to emphasize characters' subjective points of view. And how Hitchcock places Scottie in the foreground of tall objects to subliminally remind the viewer that he lives in a world of (fearful) heights. He frequently shoots from above to exaggerate vertical distances as well.The clever screenplay seems to ""shift gears"" several times, but never loses its hold on the viewer, who must pay attention as if he is negotiating Lombard Street or risk missing an important detail.

Allure of Mystery and Obsession with Looks,"For me, this is not a typical Hitchcock movie. Though there are mystery and crime elements and also some thrilling moments, the film is more about 'believing what you made to believe to see'. And this makes it more of a psychological drama. Hitchcock cleverly shows us how mystery can lure us in and get hooked. What is more how unsolved mystery can become an obsession driving a man crazy.
Scottie, a retired detective with fear of heights, gets 'hooked' on a mystery of an attractive, seductive and alluring woman. He is lead to believe that she is 'possessed' by the spirit of her great grandmother who committed a suicide. Despite being a detective albeit a retired one, Scottie remains somewhat weak character due to his original flaw - fear of heights which is used by Gavin to manipulate him - and his fascination with the mystery of the woman he cannot comprehend. His non-comprehension of the subject deepens when he tries to recreate Madeleine's look forcing Judy to alter her hair colour and style and forcing her to wear style of clothes that Madeleine used to wear. Scottie is not interested in the real woman - Judy - behind the mask of Madeleine, he is obsessed with the looks of the woman that lured him into the mystery in the first place, trying to recreate exhilaration and attraction he felt. Gavin used Judy to impersonate his wife whom he murdered and Scotties uses Judy to impersonate the impersonated Madelaine. Both men do not care for the real woman. For them she is just a tool.

hauntingly dramatic and absorbing - Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece about obsession and one of the most heart-breaking motion pictures of all time,"If there ever was a film that was truly ahead of its own time, then Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is that film. This is Hitchcock's most personal, passionate film, reportedly one of his favorites ""with some reservations"", unfortunately it did not perform very well during its 1958 release neither box office or reception wise. Hitchcock put the blame for the movie's box office failure on its star, James Stewart, whom he felt was becoming too old to keep audiences interested anymore. What Hitchcock did not realize was that this was not true. The only problem there is with Vertigo is that it was made too early in time. After a re-evaluation about ten or twenty years later, it became realized as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, is continually analyzed and studied to this day, and is regarded as his greatest achievement in film-making.Vertigo, based on a French crime novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, tells the obsessive story about a former San Francisco detective (James Stewart) suffering from acrophobia, who is asked by a friend (Tom Helmore) to follow his wife (Kim Novak) in fear that she might be possessed by the spirit of one of her ancestors and may be driven into her death. The detective becomes dangerously obsessed with the woman and ultimately falls in love with her, completely unaware of the horrific consequences that will follow.Alfred Hitchcock is affectionately known as the ""master of suspense"" for his remarkable ability to create horrifying moments such as the shower scene in Psycho (1960), another heavily analyzed film. But Hitchcock was always capable of making something far better and no where else in the director's works is that more clear than in Vertigo. This is not a horror story. This is a powerful dramatic mystery film that also embraces the rarely explored theme of obsession. Yes, it is a romantic film, but unlike any others before or after it.Of course, Vertigo is a love story. The plot is driven by James Stewart's character and his obsession with the woman he is hired to follow and suspect. But this is not at all how love stories were made before or even today. If Vertigo was made today, things would be completely different. The filmmakers would succumb to the hackneyed conventions that audience members tend to require for association with the movies they watch. The love between the two lead characters played by Stewart and Novak is not expressed through heavy, over-the-top kisses or unnecessary sex scenes like what we see today. It is shown through their actions, their behavior, their performances. Remember, this is a film that is about obsession. Not lust, obsession. And the obsession theme comes about especially within the last twenty minutes of the film. I will not explain how, I want you to look at it for yourself and see what I mean. When the movie was first released, this tactic was looked upon lowly by critics at first, again, because it was something revolutionary, ahead of its own time. It's not the conventional love story, so that also means, do not expect a few kisses and a happy ending. Again, this is revolutionary and because it's something we don't see everyday, it's so much more effective and wonderful.The leading force in this film is Alfred Hitchcock. Like I said, this is a personal film of his'. The next most effective tools are the performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak, who portray two of the most passionate lovers I've ever seen on film. And the third is definitely Bernard Herrmann, the music composer. Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese noted that Herrmann's score revolved around the main theme: obsession. And in deed, he was right. The score to Vertigo is hands-down beautiful. The scene where Scottie and Madeleine first kiss before the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean (my favorite scene) has one of the most effective soundtrack pieces ever. Basically, Herrmann's score is more than just something in the background. It's an effective, driving presence that really makes this movie so special along with its other fantastic elements. Herrmann is one of the most mimicked composers of all time and this is most obvious in Vertigo, which I feel would be about three-quarters as good without his music.It's a shame the critics of 1958 were unwilling to accept such a revolutionary film at the time. It ended the collaboration between Hitchcock and James Stewart, who had worked many times before on movies such as Rear Window (1954), and Hitchcock ultimately ended up stuck with the horror genre instead of being able to work on more passionate movies such at Vertigo. Thankfully, like wine allegedly, it gets better with age. Keep in mind, this is a movie that also likes to play with your head. You may have to see it two or three times before you get the whole picture, but when you do, you will embrace it with more power than ever. I myself have seen Vertigo a great deal of times and each time, it just gets more and more powerful. In essence, I am obsessed with Vertigo. It may have been ahead of its time, but it is certainly one of the most spectacular and wonderful motion pictures ever crafted by human hands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A dark and enigmatic work from Hitch,"Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most personal film. On the surface it's a mystery-thriller but ultimately it explores the nature of obsession; in particular one man's dangerous and uncontrollable infatuation with an enigmatic blonde woman. This being a trait that the director himself was known for, as the many peroxide leading ladies that populate his films attest.Vertigo is a somewhat enigmatic film. It doesn't offer up all its nuances on a single viewing. At face value it's a mystery, but if only taken as such it can seem potentially a little underwhelming. The plot could be seen as a little too artificial to be altogether satisfying. It's only when you begin to realize that the underlying obsession epitomized by James Stewart's character Scottie is really just as important a theme that the film's true nature in unveiled. His attitude towards Judy/Madeleine has a sinister edge. Vertigo ultimately is about a man who wants to have sex with a dead woman who in turn is possessed by another dead woman. This dark undertone only becomes apparent after the mystery of Madeleine's death has been revealed in flash-back and Hitchcock focuses in on the unhealthy obsession that underpins Scottie's persona. I think it's this skillful combination of ideas that makes Vertigo one of Hitchcock's signature films; the way he subverts the thriller narrative to explore more personal and dark themes is what makes it such an important movie in the director's canon.As with other Hitchcock films, Vertigo is beautifully presented, with lovely cinematography and a gorgeous use of colour; the rich reds and greens in particular fill the screen with Technicolor brilliance. This visual splendour is accompanied by a beautiful score from Bernard Herrmann that serves the dreamlike tone very well. All of this combines together to help create the haunting tone that the movie has, especially in the early stages where the film more or less works as a ghost story. In particular, Scottie's pursuit of the mysterious Madeleine in the early part of the film is wonderful. It's played out for the most part with no dialogue, images instead lead us on.The general consensus is that the age of the personal film-maker dawned in the 60's with the advent of the New Hollywood directors. However, Vertigo is proof that in the 50's one of the older cinematic masters was ahead of the game.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock at his dizzying best,"This is a film to watch again and again, savoring all its complexities and delirious richness. How far can a man go in a quest for a fantasy woman? Why is Scottie compelled so? And what does this movie say about its creator, a guy who continually created fantasy women (and men in dire psychological straits) for us on the screen?You can think about questions like that, or you can just immerse yourself in the fluid, mesmerizing story that Hitchcock has fashioned. And when Scottie has Judy appear in that hotel room as the reincarnation of his beloved Madeleine and they embrace as the camera circles and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score rises to a crescendo, if you don't feel a rush of empathy and pity and foreboding that rivals anything you've experienced watching any film--well, I guess this isn't your movie, my friend.

Genius,"I could write of VERRTIGO forever, but many thing has already been said and for the (hopefully few) who dont have seen this grandiose picture, it would be shame to revealed to much. But... I can say that the film is Stewarts way to the death, you can see this from the beginning. There are no way he ever could have been saved. I can say that Stewart (as in REAR WINDOW) looks like a surrogate for Hitchcock. And that is seems to be Hitchcocks most personal film. Actually it seems to be the reality of that time, where Hitchcock desperatly looked for a new Grace Kelly, and drive his actresses to madness with his obsession. Therefore it was naturally that Vera Miles should have played Madeleine/Judy. She was in a another place, as Tippi Hedren later should be, now it was the most a-normal Hitchcock heroine one can imagine, Kim Nowak, who played the part. It seems to be perfect that a ""wrong"" girl has the part. And that she was never a good a actor is not a problem. Yet it had been intresting to see, how Miles would have been in the role, perhaps it was to close the the real world. VERTIGO is a amzing masterpiece (rank it at number 28, as IMDB, is totally crazy) My favoritte film of all time is Rear Window, which is easier tó love, than this haunted film. VERTIGO remains the possible most genius film ever.P.S. Hermanns score is fabolousP.P.S It never manage Hitchcock to find a new Grace Kelly, and after it failed to give Grace Kelly a comeback with MARNIE, Hitchcocks creative gens retired.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Phenomenal,"This film, i would say this is Hitchcock at his best. This film, is said to be a classic of Hitchcock's films, and it undoubtedly is. The camera angles, the music, the acting, the plot, the director. ALL are superb. This film, is very unguessable about what will happen next, and had many twists.. Vertigo i feel was GOOD title as it pointed out the thing that held the plot together. The music corresponds with it's dramatic scenes. Vertigo showed Hitchcock had a lot more to come which he did. I love the way the colour schemes are used, with flashbacks etc.. the film has a dramatic and brilliant end which is brilliant.. Hitchcock's Masterpiece is a Must See for all.

Nowhere near Hitchcock's best,"I've only recently started exploring the filmography of Hitchcock and have been very impressed, so I was excited to dive into one of his most highly regarded works. I regret to say however that I found this alleged masterpiece to be rather lethargic and very dated.For what it is, the film is dragged out for at least half an hour too long. I think a lot could have been cut from this film to produce a much tighter and therefore more impactful piece.In terms of the plot, it is good but feels a bit dated in parts. This definitely hasn't aged as well as other Hitchcock works.The performances are fine but not great. Kim Novak is very strong but James Stewart didn't feel quite right for the role.There's still a lot to enjoy with this film, but I really don't think it is the masterpiece that it is made out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Describe the movie in one word: Excellence,"If you have ever, even for a second, doubted Alfred Hitchcock's genius and mastery of the cinematic craft, you probably haven't seen Vertigo. I mean, all of his films are fantastic and should be considered as undisputed classics, but this particular flick has something in it that makes it seem, in my opinion, like the essential Hitchcock, the one to be called his best.I don't know whether it's the supernatural aura surrounding the whole story depicted in Vertigo or not, but I was caught in the storyline right from the beginning. It certainly is one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema, and one that will send chills down the spine even after more than 50 years after its premiere.'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired police detective, after experiencing the death of one oh his fellow co-workers, is trapped in the dizzy circle of vertigo, the strange and psychedelic state of nausea brought by the fear of heights. Even though it might seem like an insignificant fact at first, it is a crucial aspect needed to understand the whole story of Vertigo.One day he gets a rather strange request from Gavin Elster, a friend from the old college days. Even though he isn't working anymore, he accepts the assignment, which involves sneaking and spying on Elster's beautiful wife, Madeleine. She is supposed to be possessed by some sort of eerie forces or a ghost from the past, which makes her wander around town doing rather strange things. At first Scottie is very skeptical about the whole situation and simply laughs at the possibility of the involvement of some out-of-this-world creations. But as he gets deeper and deeper into this job he starts to believe that, indeed, something is not right. What's more, he falls in love with the woman on the way and wants to help her with all his heart. And then, suddenly, the Earth comes calling back – Madeleine commits suicide jumping out of a church's tower. Scottie is in a state of shock and isn't able to lead a normal life. Everywhere he goes he sees her pretty face. And when one day he meets a girl so similar to her, he begins to transform her into the lovely woman from his memories.I must say that James Stewart has always been a great actor, but in the movies directed by Hitchcock he rose to a level of pure genius. The way he portrays an aging detective, who is entangled with love and then, unexpectedly, struck with grief, is unforgettable and very convincing. I love the passion in his eyes, the way he is able to show the fear of heights represented by sudden seizures. Even though I'm not a big Kim Novak fan I think that she did a good job playing this possessed woman, trapped in the past, with a dark mystery hidden behind all of her actions.Vertigo is also a groundbreaking achievement in the sense of camera use and visual effects. The impression of falling given by the spiraling out-of-control movements of the cameras in the memorable tower scene produces a thrilling experience. I could only imagine how shocking it must have been in those times. A true masterpiece in cinematography, no doubt about it.Hitchcock was always able to astound the viewers with omnipresent suspense, fantastic plots, marvelous actors and this particular style that no one was ever able to copy. I must say that Hitchcock is one of the reasons for my fascination with the film world and Vertigo has always been the picture that, for me, defined the highest peak in his career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's best...one of the greatest movies,"Screen legend James Stewart plays Scottie Ferguson, a detective who is afraid of heights. You'll see why in the opening minutes of the film. He's hired by Elster, an old acquaintance, to follow Elster's wife, Madeline played by Kim Novak. Stewart falls in love with her. To tell more of the plot would ruin the movie because it's complicated with many twists and surprises. The film takes place in San Francisco and along the California coast.If you like Hitchcock's films and the movie Vertigo run out and get Donald Spoto's book ""The Art of Alfred Hitchcock"" and read his detailed essay on Vertigo. It reveals all the symbolism and underlying structure of the film which you're not aware of as you watch. When you see the film again you'll be amazed at the complexity of the movie and what it really is about. I had no idea of what Hitchcock was doing in his films until I read the essays in Spoto's book. They're a real eye opener, especially the essay on Vertigo.Vertigo is #61 on the American Film Institute's 100 greatest films list.If you like Vertigo check out the 1955 film Les Diaboliques by Henri Georges-Clouzot. It was based on a book by the same author, Pierre Boileau, who wrote the book on which Vertigo is based. Hitchcock tried to get the rights to make that movie but was narrowly beat out by Clouzot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Boy, was I obsessed!","possible spoilers-Does anyone need another comment on Vertigo? I don't think so. I'll be brief, sort of. Vertigo is the story of an illusion, of something that cannot be had. Scottie falls in love with a woman that doesn't exist so he's bound to lose her every time he falls for her, chases her or simply tries to make somebody else into her. It's not unrequited love or doomed love, it's just love, period, the idea of love, there's nothing else because there is no one to love, just Scottie entrapped in this sexual obsession with no object that can never be satisfied and from which there is no escape. I think that's Vertigo, sort of.So what about Kim Novak? Miss Novak is Hitchcock's MacGuffin, the master's bait, the poisoned ghost he gives to Scottie to feed his imagination but at the other end of the ghost there's a woman, Judy, and she suffers the consequences. If there's a haunted soul in Vertigo is not that of Madeleine but Scottie's. Madeleine is the haunting ghost.Vertigo is a very strange movie for Hitchcock. The plot has more than one hole. Vertigo makes sense for the eyes rather than the ears. But not always in a rational way, not if you think of Novak's make-up. The Carlotta subplot, for instance, are we to believe that Hichtcock is making a supernatural thriller with a Shyamalan twist? If we go along with everything is because we look through Scottie's eyes. To show us what Scottie sees Hitchcock displays a surreal feast worthy of Bunuel accompanied by an aesthetic refinement that would make Visconti eat his heart out. He was no stranger to either surrealism or elegance but I don't think he had ever abandoned himself to his visual instincts in this way. And he had a couple of master cards up his sleeve: a devastatingly beautiful Kim Novak and a peerless James Stewart. Stewart never was a heartthrob, he was the ""everyman"". Could some 50s hunk or some contemporary ""everyman"" have done what Stewart did in Vertigo? I don't think so. He makes accessible what is twisted, rich what is baseless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Hitch's masterpiece!,"Although Psycho is perhaps Hitchcock's most notorious film, I don't think there's any question that Vertigo is Hitchcock's masterpiece.  This is a haunting, intensely moving, and tragic film.Where to begin?  This is the story of a man names Scottie Ferguson, a former detective who has recently retired from the force after his acrophobia inadvertently caused the death of a man.  Scottie is recruited  by his old friend  Gavin Elster to go back on the job and follow his wife.  It seems that Gavin's wife Madeleine has become possessed by the spirit of a deceased ancestor.  Or is she?  As we are about to learn, nothing is quite as it seems at first.It is fascinating to look at the multiple ways this film can be viewed.  It can be seen as a story about a man who is attracted to a dead woman, a cynical look at how men exploit women, or a study in male impotence.  Pay special attention to the story that the man in the book shop tells Scottie about Carlotta Valdes.  It is important in pointing out the parallels Carlotta's story has to the events that are about to transpire.  Watch the scene where Scottie and Madeleine visit a tree stump in the forest.  It is interesting to see how the characters end up repeating all their actions, visiting the same places, and making the same mistakes as if they were caught up in a whirlpool (hence the symbolism in the opening credits).The back story about the making of this film is interesting as well. Hitchcock was infatuated with actress Grace Kelly and would remake many other actresses in her image.  Hitchcock was disappointed when Vera Miles got pregnant and was unable to star in Vertigo.  Fortunately, Hitchcock did a very good job remaking Kim Novak in Vera Miles' image.  No wonder this is considered to be Hithcock's most personal film.Hitchcock directs this film in glowing colour creating a dreamlike atmosphere and Bernard Hermann created one of his all-time greatest music score's to accompany us through this film.  It is worth buying on CD to play all on its own.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"psychological thriller, excellent performances","'Vertigo' is an engaging film about a detective who has a fear of heights and is led to follow a woman whose husband fears is possessed. While spying on the woman, the main character falls in love with her and saves her life. He vows to protect her, but his fear of heights prevents him from doing all that he can do. The film is a psychological thriller with some humour and romance. The scenes are beautiful and meaningful with pacing that adds to the story and adds to the psychology of the characters. The attention to detail is just as good in this film as it is in the other Hitchcock films. The acting is also done well with believable performances given by all. The female lead puts on a remarkable performance playing the possessed woman.The only complaint I have about this film is the ending, from the disaster until the end of the film. The theory behind what I think the director was trying to convey (fantasy) is imaginative, but the ending literally left me hanging without much of a resolution. It does not spoil the film, but this was somewhat of a let-down to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Some Stewarts and Hitchcocks Finest,","Vertigo is an outstanding movie with a very mysterious and unpredictable plot and very strong performances. I would not say his best, but it's very close to one of James Stewarts greatest performances. He was very powerful in this movie and his characters personality was very different to his other roles. Kim Novak's performance was also breathtaking. Its one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time, and that's no surprise, it is a crazy ride from start to finish and you never know what's going to happen next.

"I know I'm committing sacrilege, but...","For some reason, over the years, I've seen only bits and pieces of this movie and never in its entirety. Finally, tonight, I did. And this is all I have to say: Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, North by Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Young and Innocent, Psycho, Saboteur, Sabotage, and a few others warrant more acclaim than this over-long, over-rated, over-done and over-wrought production. It can be rated a seven-starrer and on a night when I'm feeling giddy with generosity, 8. But all in all a sour disappointment. How it managed to grow in acclaim, I am at a loss. The acting was superlative, with Stewart growing from a barely bearable personality (dull and duller) to a thoroughly dislikable fellow who'd been done wrong. Kim Novak was a delightful surprise. I've always liked her and found her to be very sympathetic whenever I've seen her - Middle of the Night, Picnic, - and a much better actress than was generally granted. In this she excelled. Barbara Bel Geddes should have been elevated to greater stardom and Tom Helmore was perfect as the heel. The photography was good, colorful, with interesting collage-like minutes of sailing/falling through air. The music was non-stop (unusual in movies) - there was never a moment when some notes were not being heard and they heightened the intensity. But...But: 2 hours and 8 minutes! No movie should be 2 hours and 8 minutes. It's like reading a fat book that can't help but repeat itself. I did like it though and would REALLY have liked it had it shaved off at least 20 minutes in the middle. But Shadow of a Doubt? Now, THAT'S movie magic.

one of the greatest movies ever.,"I personally think that Vertigo is the greatest movie of all time, although a couple of people before me who wrote reviews on this site think otherwise. For anyone who likes Hitchcock but hasn't seen this movie, and for anyone who has even heard about Alfred hitchcock let's get this out of the way, this is hitchcock's masterpiece. Psycho was a great film, and it's right up there  too, but Vertigo wins. I won't go into a lengthly analysis of the film, if you're reading this you've probably read the analysis. This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, surreal visuals and incredible suspense, even more so than his other great picture, Psycho. The score by Bernard Hermann is possibly the best i have ever heard in a motion picture, adding to the suspense especially in the dream sequence. Unlike some of the people in the reviews before i'm deliberatly trying not to reveal the plot, i saw it the first time, without knowing what the story was, and not realy knowing that much about hitchcock and i was absolutely blown away. I think that's all i really need to say, i think that this is Hitchcock's greatest film and is required viewing for any lovers of suspense along with Psycho, of course, North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train and the 39 steps. And one last message, to any movie executives that are by chance reading this, please DO NOT remake this, it's perfect the way it is, you got Psycho already, isn't that enough?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A Romantic and Psychological Mystery with a Metaphysical Aura,"If anyone has produced a more engrossing mystery than this, Hitchcock's finest effort and his most unique film, please tell me.  No gimmicks here, just an enigmatic tale of love, lust, betrayal, and a mystery that envelopes one with a feeling of being in another world.  So many classic scenes that it is no wonder it consistently shows up on top ten lists.  If anyone isn't swept away by the performances and the intrigue of the plot, they should go so their doctor to see if they are still alive. The one scene that really gives me the feeling that there are metaphysical forces at work here is the one the in redwoods at the center of the film.  Many cite the scene in the small hotel as a pivotal part of the plot, the point where Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) has finally lost himself to his compulsion.  Kim Novak plays her character exactly as Hitchcock intended and she was perfectly cast.  She never came up to this level again in her career.

"Boring, slow, stretched out to a full 2 hours that feels more like 3 hours.","I love older movies and shows. I love Alfred Hitchcock. I was so excited to watch this movie after all the reverence that it's received and now I can finally say, wow -- what a let down. I truly believe that people are simply pretending that this movie is better than it really is because of the fact that it's Alfred Hitchcock. Is this a bad movie? No, I wouldn't say that. Would I ever watch it again? No, I don't think I ever will.The characters were pretty interesting, I enjoyed Stewart, the writing was pretty good, but the whole movie was so damn stretched out and slow moving that I was literally BEGGING for the movie to finally finish. The plot twist was... a bit ridiculous and even more than that, the actual ending right before the credits role was mind bogglingly stupid. Also, I liked Stewart's character a lot more when he was with his friend -- the girl with the glasses, whereas when he was with the girl he fell in love with, he became so incredibly dull. The chick with the glasses was WAY more interesting of a character but she was incredibly underused and then the movie literally just forgets about her existence half way through. I would say that the movie is worth seeing at least once, as long as you're already a Hitchcock fan who's sees plenty of his other work and as long as you lower your expectations. This is absolutely not an 8/10 movie and the only reason it has such reverence is the name that is attached to it along with it's age. I was very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Greatest American movie of all time,"Vertigo is the greatest English-language movie of all time.  It goes deeper than any other film and its exploration of obsessive love should be required viewing for anyone concerned with the human condition. Unfortunately, it's also a vastly under-appreciated film.I've seen Vertigo in the theater maybe 9 or 10 times, more than any other movie.  The audience is always on the verge of booing at the end.  I can sympathize with them.  I didn't like it the first time I saw it either.  The movie has a major plot twist about three-quarters of the way through and an ending that is anything but traditional Hollywood.  Hitchcock's Psycho also has a big plot twist, but it happens much earlier in the story, and Psycho is more superficial and less emotionally involving.The second time I saw Vertigo, its greatness came through and I was able to appreciate it for the masterpiece - and I don't use that word lightly - that it is.  All the things that moviegoers may object to - the slow pace, protagonist's breakdown, non-happy ending - they're all integral to its greatness.

Mood-Setting at its finest as Hitchcock speaks his mind and soul,"Alfred Hitchcock has created some of the most interesting, distinctive, and chilling suspense masterpieces ever attempted in the movie industry. Already being a fan of his work and knowing of his life, I was excited to see Vertigo, but nothing prepared me for what I was up for. It's different from Hitchcock's other directorial efforts, definitely being the most personal. Vertigo glimmers with the touch of autobiographical art that works so well in other movies by directors speaking from their soul, like 8 1/2 from Fellini. The film is really as wonderful as its reputation holds it up to be. It's an enthralling piece that has turns so sharp it could cut flesh. Hitchcock creates an eerie mood that settles perfectly with the noir-eseqe story. It's psychologically engaging and challenging through the underlying suspense. Everywhere you look in Vertigo, there's a symbol. Each shot feels as if its been planned out and thought ahead by Hitchcock. The film editing hits every artistic note and the the score wows your ears.The entire movie plays like a ghost movie, but the fascinating thing about this explored theme is ghost changes with each Act. The ghost haunts your mind as it haunts the mind of James Stewart (who also delivers a fine performance), therein lies the brilliance. The film noir references create some poetically beautiful scenes that show the truth of human nature, whether its love, obsession, or insanity. Vertigo is technically ahead of its time, allowing audiences today to respond to it just as they would any movie released in 2013. It's a multi- layered film about complex characters, infatuation, and duplicity. Being autobiographical and knowing what we know about Hitchcock's life, some thoroughly depicted in Hitchcock (2012), Vertigo makes a lot of sense and we get to explore the heart and mind of Alfred Hitchcock. I believe, that Hitchcock, as a child fell in love with a proper, blonde woman, and she broke his heart. Now, as a response to that heartache, Hitchcock tries to recreate that fantasy to ease the hole left in his heart. The faux idea almost works as therapy for Hitchcock. Just my observation and a thought being thrown out there that could possibly explain his obsession and compulsion to the picture of his ""perfect woman"" he paints all over Vertigo.Vertigo capitalizes Hitchcock's life, symbolizing his filmmaking and the tendency to emotionally and psychologically attach himself to his leading actresses. The pieces of the puzzle to Vertigo feel like the pieces of the puzzle of Hitchcock's life, yet they fit together anomalously perfectly in the film, but I doubt they did in real life. Hitchcock was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to visit the lives of fictitious people and pliably craft that perfect woman expressively through art. His madness and determination are seen in Vertigo, through the James Stewart character. I wonder if Stewart knew he was playing Hitchcock himself in ways?In all honesty, I can identity with Hitchcock's tendencies. Clearly, not to the excessive and creepy levels of his life, but there's always that hole in myself I've tried to fill with the idea of the ""perfect"" best friend in my life, all have been beautiful, confident females. I can link my another obsession I have with Hitchcock's life tribulations: my spurts with actresses. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow are all women I've went through addictions where they stayed with me because of their work as actresses or their displays of their success in life. I've never been able to put my interest with them into sensible analytical thought, but the slight obsession has always been there.Vertigo touches me in the same ways that propelled Hitchcock to complete this film, it's rare when a movie can do that a viewer, but that's a reason directors sometimes make movies. We're all human and we all have things in common that we can share with each other. Regardless if you can link your soul to the artistic soul of Alfred Hitchcock, Vertigo is certainly something not to be missed. It's an exemplary mood-setting mystery that still has viewers in awe of the artistry and the plot twists that set the fantastic finale into place.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A classic thriller that is cerebrally captivating from start to finish,"While there are films about how the meaning of true love is defined by lovers truly being able to accept each other, despite their mistakes a la ""Sunrise,"" there are films that venture into territory that deals with how we think we have the answers in our hearts, until we find out that we've chosen to travel a narrow, linear path, when we could have thought more rationally outside of our own heads and realized we could have built more bridges to act as a ""safety net.""Does this obsession mean we're isolating ourselves within our own subjective opinions and does it make us a bad person if we feel our instincts will lead to somewhere, or does it mean we're naive? All I know is that 'Vertigo' manages to tell a side of humanity, in that we are all susceptible to becoming vulnerable in the general sense. We may have our strengths, but we will always have our weaknesses.Is there a lesson to be learned by any of this or do we just have to learn to live with this knowing that this type of ambivalence cannot be prevented all the time? Does 'Vertigo' answer any of this? I do not know if it does, but maybe you the viewer will think otherwise. Whatever you may be thinking about, 'Vertigo' is a film that every film lover should see. 'Vertigo' to me is a thriller that is very psychological in that it made me question a side of our humanity that plays a part in our interactions with people.

My Personal Favorite - Dazzling and Incomparable,"After watching movies for almost forty years (is that possible!), I wondered what might qualify as my personal favorite.  Sunset Blvd? Becket? Raiders of the Lost Ark? All About Eve? A Star is Born (37 version)? Dodsworth? Body Heat? Quite an eclectic mix, huh!Vertigo heads my personal list. And I remember when first (finally) seeing this, after several years of it being unavailable. WOW! But that was only the initial viewing, with the plot captivating me.  The movie had received only lukewarm reviews and was not considered top tier Hitchcock (perhaps this was in the early 1970's).Delighted that so many IMDB members, and critics too, have altered their opinions over the past 30 years.  Nice to be part of a majority for once LOLWhat dazzles me about Vertigo is virtually everything! This score was not even nominated for an Oscar (we play the soundtrack every few weeks). The photography, use of color, of one of the world's best looking cities. Costumes, everything is classy Hitchcock.I remember timing one of the early sequences, perhaps 5 full minutes go by without any dialog (guess Hitch wanted to briefly return to his early pre-talkie days!). I bet this movie would be quite a splendid experience to watch with the sound off!Ok, the story is fantastic (in all senses of the word).  But how did Hitch get Kim Novak to give this performance?But let's talk about James Stewart, to my mind, the most talented of all movie actors (not that Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson and Jack Nicolson are not right up there as well).  Without repeating what everyone else has written, among the greats this is his greatest.Color, script, acting, mood, music, photography --- Hitch, thank you for this masterwork.

Now its like a saw across bone without anesthesia. Also its Hitchcocks most beautiful film, with the greatest sense of color and mise en scene, possibly his most complex script. It's deadly accurate psycho-analysis. Jimmy Stewart is creepy as hell in this too.

An emotionally complex masterpiece.,"This is definitely my favorite Hitchcock film. When I first watched it, I viewed it as a tragic romance film, but only with future viewings did I really how wrong this reading was and that, in reality, Scottie was dangerous and obsessive. For instance, after Madeleine jumped into a river in an apparent suicide attempt, Scottie's way of handling the situation was by bringing her to his house, undressing her, and leaving her in his bed without telling anybody what happened (a doctor, a neighbor, or even Midge or Gavin, at the very least). If this doesn't make him creepy, I honestly don't know what would. The less time he spends with Midge and the more time he spends around Madeleine, the more clear it is that he's emotionally damaged and that the movie is about the dangers of his obsession, which extend to his fixation on Madeleine in place of Midge, his creepy behavior and demands with Judy, or the reveal that Gavin chose Scottie out of the likely hundreds of acquaintances he had since he knew that Scottie was the only person peculiar and strange enough that his elaborate scheme could possibly depend on. In spite of what we learn about the other characters in the final act, I think the full extent to Scottie's emotional damage is revealed during this part of the film (most of this is caused by Gavin and Judy though) and, as a result, we ultimately fear for Judy and are on her side.There's also a few other things I love about this film. For one, Hitchcock utilizes technicolor better than almost every film I can think of. Through its red and green color pallet, it's able to convey such a strong emotional reaction, with red indicating danger and green indicating lust. Also, I've seen some people express boredom over Scottie tailing Madeleine by car, but I find that sequence to be an excellent slice of slow-burning tension. In fact, most of that sequence consists of Scottie driving downhill (San Francisco is a coastal city and has a number of hills), symbolizing his descent into obsession. It's a great touch to that sequence which makes it all the more atmospheric. I also loved the terrific dream sequence in the middle as, instead of feeling unnecessary, it was actually a product of Scottie's damaged emotional state. Lastly, I think the ending is perfect. Yes, it's abrupt, but intentionally so as the abruptness and confusion of it matches Scottie's headspace. The emotions it leaves me with linger long after the credits, anyways.Overall, this is an emotionally complex masterpiece which never ceases to blow me away. Rear Window used to be my favorite Hitchcock film, but it lost its throne to this film a couple years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Love this flick!  Gorgeous, haunting, classic!","I recently re-discovered and fell in love with this movie. I'd seen it years before, but the first viewing didn't ""grab"" me for some reason.It's one of my favorites now, though.Some viewers complain that the plot is too convoluted, doesn't make sense, etc., but I think the best approach is not to take it too literally, if that's possible for you. Just take it as someone's dream (or nightmare). If you're after an action movie or that sort of thing, it might be best to let that mood pass before watching Vertigo.Highlights for me: the Saul Bass credits, the opening rooftop chase, the psychedelic nightmare sequence, the gorgeous Bernard Herrmann music, the eerie art gallery scene. It's all great, though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Great plot, as always from Hitchcock's works","The story opens up strongly, introducing one key element to the whole plot. The plot itself unravels very nicely giving out the details bit by bit. I really like the main twist, although I kind of regret its positioning that kind of spoils quite about everything. The end twist tried to compensate for it but it's way much more predictable after the main twist spoils it all. Though personally I like Rear Window better than this movie, I think Vertigo can still make it to the great movies list because this movie serves a tale that is more focused on the psychological side of the mystery thriller. The acting side is nice in overall. It's always nice to see James Stewart's performance. Kim Novak can really give Stewart the balancing performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Kim Novak was Radiant,"Have not seen this film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed the great acting by Kim Novak, (Madeline Elster/Jude Barton). I also enjoyed the great film locations in San Francisco, California where I lived for a few years and recognized all the places that took place in this film. Alfred Hickcock did an outstanding job of directing this film and in most of his films, he loves beautiful blonde's and he sure pick a great actress in this film. Detective, Scottie Ferguson is asked by a long time good friend to keep an eye on his wife because she has started acting very peculiar. Scottie has just retired from the police force because of a problem he encountered chasing a fugitive on a high building and he developed vertigo. Scottie follows Madeline Elster all over San Francisco and even saving her from jumping into San Francisco Bay.

What A Film,"I still need to go through Hitchcock's entire back catalogue, but this is the best film I've seen by the director so far. From the great acting and dialogue, terrific rooftop visuals and the combination of beautiful, suspenseful music. I enjoyed the mesmeric views of San Francisco during the 1950s and the beautiful saloon cars with white wall tyres and blazing logos.The pace of the film unfolds quite cleverly. One minute the husband is asking the detective for help, neatly followed by a refusal, the next moment the detective is already working undercover, no need for acceptance speeches or excessive justifications. It's simply masterful scriptwriting flow.After 30 minutes running time I still had no real idea what the film was about, not that it made a jot of difference, followed by Hitchcock's knack of revealing practically everything all at once so that we don't get too bogged down. The scene being set once again for the next, even more mysterious part.The film does dip in pace a little during the mid section, but picks up again after a major incident, surprising us with surreal dreaming sequences, intertwining monochrome colours with bizarre and rather spooky effects.The film scores on so many levels that it left me be a little overwhelmed. It could be regarded as a story of longing or unrequited love, of madness and schizophrenic flashbacks, or a straightforward detective based mystery thriller, depending on how you look at it. The film is more thought provoking than any other Hitchcock film I've seen so far, I had to pause to consider the manner in which the plot had turned and why the situation had arrived at that particular point.It's a very intimate, almost creepy film in places about love, obsession, deceit and betrayal with pre-psychedelic overtones. I thought the switches between time and space were simply fantastical, with the twists and turns adding layer upon layer of intrigue, never getting old nor giving too much.After the underwhelming disappointment (for me) of James Stewart in 'Rear Window', this was a massive hit, putting Hitchcock firmly back on the historical 'best of' film map.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Deemed as great, I'll go with ....very good!","This film has been heralded as Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece, his most personal thriller and a major classic. Its even ranked in the IMDb top 50. That's all very impressive and while I can't say I don't like the movie, I'm not willing to get quite that giddy with praise. I just watched it again, the magnificently restored version, in Hi Def. That's also very impressive.So where does it fall short of its lofty historic ranking for me, hard to say without sounding awfully nit-picky. Maybe it is nit-picky. The lush San Fransico background is amazing. The artwork, the flowers, the surrounding architecture are dazzling. The award winning music score is perfect for 1958 and sets the movie's mood, which changes several times, in lush, often rousing tones. But........ the story, the pacing and even some of the casting has always left me cold. Hitchcock can play a scene for a long time, almost leisurely, to get a MOOD. In ""VERTIGO"" they are maddenly leisurely. And the premise of the possessed wife, the concerned husband, the off kilter damaged cop, the insurance con is downright goofy! Especially the race to leap off the building for a dramatic suicide. The part 1 love story can be bought (the con and all!), and well played by the two stars, but the part 2 love story is so dark and possessive that it has always smacked of mean spirited to me.Now the casting. Jimmy Stewart has never taken a false step, but at age 50, despite his perfectly coiffed toupee and heavy makeup still looks it. Kim Novak, despite the worst eyebrows in cinema history, is a ravishing early 20's and looks it. The fake and then real attraction to Stewart is hard to imagine. Especially when the apparently lonely (how could she be) and distraught Novak, who really loved Jimmy, has heaps of humiliation piled on her by the dark and damaged Stewart. It threw my ""suspension of belief"" off a bit. And the surprisingly attractive Barbara Del Geddes (pre-Dallas Matron) is supposed to be Stewart's old college chum!! He must have been post, post grad and she was Freshman. Hey, I said it was nit-picky!!I've read that the movie was actually poorly received and attended during its initial release. And that was at the height of Stewart's and Hitchcock's powers. The supreme inventive director of his day, he used interesting angles and zooming in and out cameras to get all his desired affects of vertigo. If there was better entertainment around in '58, with more star power, I'd be surprised, so why not a hit?? Were people nit-picky then too??",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"The definitive Hitchcock picture, and one of the greatest movies ever made","How can I begin to describe how much I truly adore this film? To me there is no there story that expresses the intense emotional desires depicted here. I believe that Jimmy Stewart truly outdid himself here-an even greater performance than his portrayal of Jefferson Smith. The metamorphosis Scottie undergoes is the highest emotional arc of a character I have ever witnessed. Kim Novak's inexperience and nervousness led to her stiff portrayal of Madeline. A truly brilliant script that has no real equal. I believe that Hitchcock truly revealed more of himself here than in any of his other work. North By Northwest, Psycho, and Notorious are all great movies-but I find that they will never match up to the masterpiece that is VERTIGO.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of my favorite Hitchcock movies to watch.,"It's amazing what a nose and eye Hitchcock had for a great story. Throughout the decades he had always picked up some great scripts or bought the rights from some great novels.There probably is no other Hitchcock movie than this one, that I've seen more often. It's simply because this is such a fine and pleasant one to watch. It's definitely one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, though let it be noted that favorite is something totally different than best.You don't have to be a big Hitchcock enthusiast to appreciate this movie. You don't have to be familiar with any of his visual style or way of storytelling to get sucked in by this movie. It's therefore a perfectly accessible and also timeless movie to watch, for basically just about everybody. So don't let anything hold you back from watching this movie.Foremost reason why this is such a fine quality movie to watch is due to its very well written story. It's a mystery, it's a thriller and it's a romantic movie, all in one. It means that the story is often going at different places, which in return provides the movie with a very fast and pleasant pace. The movie keeps changing its style and approach often with its story and characters. It throws in a couple of nice twists, that obviously work out most effectively the first time you watch this movie and have no idea where the movie is heading to.My only complaint is that the second half of this movie just isn't as good and interesting as its first. It didn't made the best choices with its characters and story in my opinion, which also goes a bit at the expense of the movie its credibility. It's also less entertaining, since it picks a more serious and dramatic approach. But obviously it's nothing too horrible and actually is all still quite good, or else I wouldn't had rated this movie as highly.Visually and technically this also really is one superior movie. The movie got done really well in its build up and just its overall execution in general. It's actually amazing to see the amount of special effects shots in this movie, some more obvious than others. Added to this gets the fine musical score by Bernard Herrmann and you have one fine unique movie, in terms of its style and approach.The years were already starting to count for James Stewart in this movie. It would also be the least movie he and Alfred Hitchcock made together. It was one fine and successful collaboration between the two and they made four together throughout their careers. There is really not one Hitchcock/Stewart movie that I found nothing short of great. So credit also still needs to go to James Stewart and his performance in this movie. And I don't know what Hitchcock's beef was with Kim Novak but in my opinion she is one of the best leading ladies an Hitchcock movie ever had. She really gave away one fine performance, especially when considering her still quite young age at the time.Really one of my favorite Hitchcock movies to watch, with a more than great story and also one of his movies that is simply timeless and not as much a product of its time, as some of his other movies.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee, DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee","`Vertigo' is Hitchcock's first deeply odd film.  There would be two more: `The Birds' (1963) and `Marnie' (1964).  After that he returned to the straight-forward, sane plots of his youth.  (`Frenzy' (1972), for instance, is yet another version - by my count, the fifth - of `The 39 Steps'.)`Rope' was filmed all in one continuous shot, and `Spellbound' had dream sequences designed by Salvador Dali, but that's not the kind of thing I mean.  It's the moral outlook of `Vertigo' that's odd.  `OF COURSE Scottie will behave in this fashion,' Hitchcock seems to be saying.  `Who wouldn't?' I don't know why I'm so willing to play along: maybe it's the surreal way San Fancisco is shot so that it appears to be a city not of this Earth, maybe the score by Bernard Herrmann.  (It's easily and beyond doubt Herrmann's best Hitchcock score).  Part of the reason I so enjoy following a film that is, objectively speaking, so slow, surely has to do with the fact that Scottie's motivation is explained, but it's never explained in advance. An air of suspense permeates the picture without being concentrated in any one part.I find it hard to understand the people who prefer `North by Northwest'.  IF you're a fan of the American Hitchcock - I'm an Anglophile, myself - then this is surely the apotheosis, the perfect expression of everything Hitchcock had been reaching towards in America.  This is a film GROWN in America, not a transplant from foreign soil the way `North by Northwest' is. (Yes, I know it's based on something French, but that's beside the point: it's the place where Hitchcock first makes the transfer to celluloid that's important.)  Preferring `Rear Window' or `Psycho', on the other hand: THAT I could understand.To conclude with a gauche display of star-worship, Kim Novak is surely Hitchcock's most attractive ever female lead - and she plays an interesting character, too, which is more than can be said for most of Hitchcock's actresses.  If Scottie must become obsessed to the point of madness with anyone, let it be her.  Sorry, Midge, but that's what you're up against.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Fabulous, Nuanced Filmmaking Tinged with a Strong Sense of Discomfort","Jimmy Stewart's fourth and final collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, starring as John Ferguson, a detective whose life unravels when he develops acrophobia amidst a rooftop foot chase. A troubling picture in many ways, from its complex, effectively unsettling filmmaking to the distressing changes undertaken by Ferguson in the third act. Hitchcock is, of course, a master of the craft and there's much to be learned from his efforts behind the camera (the now-infamous dolly zoom, tricks with lighting and foreshadowing, a casual pace that somehow never seems to grow stale) but also plenty to wonder about the man himself from the actions of his on-screen counterpart. In a Hitchcock film, it's nothing new for a visibly older gentleman to effortlessly draw the affections of a young blonde. Stewart's no exception in this film, pulling buxom Kim Novak (twenty-five years his junior), but his particular brand of obsession quickly grows dark and insistent, leading to some very squeamish scenes as he draws close to unraveling the conspiracy that's ensnared them both. Of course, Ferguson ultimately pays a price for this turn, but his greater judgment is never laid out on the screen. Rather, it's abruptly left to the scrutiny of the viewing audience, with more than a nudge to suggest he may not be completely without alibi. Expertly concocted and tragic from a bird's-eye perspective, but worrying from a more introspective one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Simply incredible,"Vertigo directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime drama which surrounds one retired detective who is asked to take on one last task. The task is to follow his college friend's wife due to her recent bizarre behaviour. And from that point the audience is taken on such a captivating and unexpected journey. Vertigo is simply incredible. Everything in the film is still outstanding. The cinematography, music, acting and script are some of the best ever. What I love particularly is how unpredictable it is. The movie takes such incredible turns, which really compels the audience even further. The sinister tone of the movie is so magnetic, as the feelings and emotions remain with you beyond the credits. The film ends with such a high, confirming why it is one of the most memorable movie experiences in history. My only issue is the first act, which at times can feel quite slow due to that fact that audience doesn't have that emotional attachment to the characters and story yet. Although the film progresses and builds brilliantly. Vertigo will forever be timeless so therefore I give it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Ode to Hitchcock, part three","We all have our fears: some fear of heights, others are afraid of the darkness, and some are terrified of any kind of commitment or responsibility. In the end fears are made to be mastered and to make us stronger so that we could become free to do whatever we want to without doubts and uncertainties. But being afraid is also good because thanks to fear itself we sense life, we feel alive, and fear is the best thing to keep us this way.From movie to movie Hitch tries something new: new camera angles, new plot twists, new special effects, and, of course, new ways to scare us, the viewers. ""Vertigo"" is no exception.From the beginning until the end the movie grips you tight by the wrist and doesn't let go; right when you feel like you've figured out the puzzle you discover a new set of pieces that were lying under the carpet this whole time. What differs this body of work from others of Alfred's is that ""Vertigo"" uses more of a detective approach in the way of telling the story and even a drop of mysticism which gives a lot of food for us to think about.James Stewart gives one of his best performances here - we can just simply watch him drive a car but his face gives away so much that is going on in his head that we never stop wondering about what exactly is he thinking right now; the ""vertigo"" moments of his, being masterfully shot through zooming, make your skin shiver along. Kim Novak is absolutely stunning in the movie and easily gives the best dramatic performance in her career. Bernard Herrmann, once again, manages to find a way to surprise and please the viewers with his magnificent score that smoothly flows throughout the movie and frames all of the scenes with their own different moods.Alfred knows how to make movies; he knows what's important, what needs to be underlined and what is better left between the lines and he gives just the right amount of everything to ensure you're staying till the end. A true master.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Jewel Amongst Hitchcock Jewels,"Of the many classic works that form the celluloid legacy left by Alfred Hitchcock, critics have long debated which could be deemed the quintessential Hitchcock movie.......the one that might best encapsulate the unerring deft hand of the oft-titled Master Of Suspense.There are certainly plenty to choose from. SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943), ROPE (1948), STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951) and REAR WINDOW (1954), all exhibited a unique blend of suspense and macabre humour toward the subject of murder, that audiences in the 1940s and 50s had not experienced before. NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) meanwhile, offered espionage, mistaken identity, romance and thrills in what is one of it's director's most flamboyant and fast-paced offerings.Then there is PSYCHO (1960), a film whose reputation stakes a claim as his defining work - partly for the controversy it courted at the time of it's release but undoubtedly more so for the generations of audiences it would terrify and make think twice about stepping into a shower with it's familiar shrieking strings unleashed by composer Bernard Herrmann.In 1963 he shocked moviegoers again with THE BIRDS (1963), a spectacular entry of sorts in cinema's animal-amok sub-genre that has still only since been rivalled by Spielberg's JAWS (1975).In 1958 however, Hitchcock made arguably his most complex and multi-layered movie. A film about desire, love, obsession, phobia, loss and redemption.VERTIGO stars the ever-reliable James Stewart as confirmed bachelor Scottie, a police detective whose discovery that he suffers from acrophobia - caused by a form of vertigo - leads to the death of a colleague at the start of the movie. Guilt-ridden, he retires from the force but is shortly thereafter hired privately by old college pal Gavin Elster, to secretly follow his wife Madeline who appears to be suffering blackouts and exhibiting odd behaviour that she has no subsequent memory of. Behaviour that indeed, threatens to end in her suicide. A suggestion of possession by a long-dead descendant who died at Madeline's age by her own hand is put by Elster to Scottie, who is sceptical and dismissive of such a notion. In following Madeline however, this theory begins to look more and more credible as her unbalanced behaviour increasingly replicates that of her descendant - a descendant of whom she herself has no knowledge.Played in fittingly aloof fashion by the icy-elegant Kim Novak, Madeline soon becomes Scottie's object of desire but this is only the beginning. What lies ahead is a labyrinth of twists and deceptions that lead Scottie into an odyssey of love, madness and obsession by way of a tragedy from which he has to recover his sanity to somehow face a future that appears once again shattered by his vertigo.It is at this point where James Stewart really comes into his own, playing a deeply troubled character in a role unlike any he had previously been assigned (or indeed would ever be again) throughout a remarkable lengthy career. That Hitchcock was able to extract this range from him is a credit also to the director. Guilt, failure and an undying love for a spectre of his past follow a mental breakdown and form an obsession to mold the present back to a point in time where Scottie can escape the tragedy consuming him. In a bizarre twist of fate he then seemingly happens upon an unexpected second chance to redeem himself and undo the loss and despair that haunts him. In making this journey, Scottie will try to rewrite his past to reclaim his life, his love and his sanity. In doing so however, will the outcome offer deliverance..........or will he only capture an illusion?To reach the moment of truth he must ultimately again face his vertigo.Throughout the proceedings, Hitchcock's storytelling techniques have never been better. Colourful swirling, kaleidoscopic patterns accompany the opening credits, underscored by Bernard Hermmann's exceptional main title, conjuring a surreal, illusory quality that perfectly sets the scene for what will follow. A nightmare sequence during the depths of Scottie's despair builds on this with striking imagery, reminiscent somewhat of Salvador Dali's concept work on Hitchcock's earlier SPELLBOUND (1945). Great use is also made of authentic San Francisco shooting locations that here become mapping points in Scottie's experiences with Madeline.Arguably most memorable of all, is the hotel sequence in the latter stages of the film. The pivotal moment where it seems Scottie might defeat his demons and reclaim what was cruelly stolen from him. Shot with filters and washed out with neon lighting glaring in through the window from the hotel sign, the scene has a disturbing sickly quality to it that appears to replicate Scottie's troubled state of mind. It is undeniably sumptuous however and culminates in what was the longest on-screen kiss filmed up to that point, achieved with a lengthy continuous take circling the characters while the background locations alter from one to another behind them. All this accompanied by Hermmann's remarkably moving romantic score.VERTIGO is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's most ambitious work and is undoubtedly among his very best. Essentially it is a tale of one person trying desperately to chase the past while another tries in vain to escape it. Though the story elements may be at times implausible and collapse under close scrutiny, it is the thoughts and questions they provoke that endure and resonate. Where does love begin? Where does it end and obsession start? Could desire be an age-old insanity?Are there really ever any second chances in life?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Alfred Hitchcock was a very great director, and made many films which could be called great.  But this was the best of the lot!  To go through the plot would take up too much time and space, as it is very, very complicated.  Suffice to say that the writing, the direction, and the performances have an intensity which have never quite been equalled.  Oh, heck!  See the film yourself!  You'll see what I mean!By the way, Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Directior, despite making several magnificent films (and many many more very good ones, too) during his 35+ years in Hollywood (not to mention some 20 years in Britain before that).

A One time watch and that's all.,"The film will carry you slowly towards a nice story. In the beginning I would say, I could not understand the motive and where the film was going. But it builds the story slowly so I would say it is a kind of a slow movie, but the moment you feel to get bored, a new surprise will be waiting for you. Well you would enjoy films like these only when you allow your mind to go into that time. And do not compare the techniques of today with that of oldies. It is not necessary to keep this in mind for every film but for this film you will certainly need to keep this in mind. And for the movie, I would say the editing could have been better because it seemed to be disorienting at some times.

What Happened Hitch ?,"First I thought I'd list my top 10 Hitchcock films 1) Under Capricorn 2) Notorious 3) Rear Window 4) I, Confess 5) North By Northwest 6) Frenzy 7) The Lady Vanishes 8) Rope 9) The 39 Steps 10) Spellbound I consider myself a big Hitchcock fan I've got over 35 of Hitchcocks films and for me Vertigo is near the bottom I've never understood why this film is hyped up, Stewart puts in a poor performance, for him, so he's still pretty good but Kim Novak is abysmal.  The story has massive plot holes and is incredibly slow I can usually watch slow paced talkies as I've pointed out above I think Under Capricorn is his best film and that's slow and talkie but Capricorn is always interesting and has the fantastic Ingrid Bergman with Joseph Cotton.  For me after Rear Window Hitchcock lost the plot a bit and often his films started to drag with Vertigo and the Birds being the worst offenders.  The only films he made after Rear Window that are worthy of his great name are North by Northwest, Psycho (well the first hour) and Frenzy.

Doing so, John gets dangerously obsessed with her and things starts to complicate.Movie is like a ticking time bomb, keeps you puzzled, revealing important twists time to time. Like any other Hitchcock work, here you feel and live what characters feel and live. James as the lead actor does an astounding job. Kim Novak is gorgeous and magnetic as Madeleine Elster but somewhat mechanical as Judy Barton.But Vertigo is not without its flaws. Other than lead characters, people keep disappearing just like that from the plot, like Kim's husband and James's friend. The whole focus is on James and his fear of heights. Going towards end, movie heightens the suspense but leaves you with a heartbreaking climax that somewhat lessens the overall impact.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Vertigo. It is controversially one of the best of Hitchcock but it is still way ahead in its genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
SHOCKING,"The plot is mysterious, suspenseful, romantic and hypnotizing - in the most twisted way (and without today's visceral film violence).The film's plot follows a boy (James Stewart) who falls for a girl (Kim Novak). The girl happens to look strikingly similar to a woman that the boy's character was secretly in love with - and who fell to her death under the boy's helpless watch. In a demented Pygmalion-esque turn, Stewart's character develops an obsession with transforming his new love interest into a clone of his fallen angel, and the two develop a dangerous - even fatalistic - relationship. Big Think's Bob Duggan says that this haunting interaction and the dreamy scenes that Hitchcock films it in make Vertigo one of the greatest films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Vertigo- true to its title,"Hitchcock is fantastic. Even if one doesn't regularly like old films, I guarantee everyone will love at each one, if not 5 or 10 Hitchcock films. That being said, this movie has a lot to live up to, and it does with flying color. Just when you think you have the movie figured out, there's a new twist. I'll admit it drug out a little in the middle, but it's still a very fast paced movie- you have no idea what's going to happen. A few highlights: the score, opening scene and final shot. Also, Jimmy Stewart isn't your typical Mr. nice guy this time, weather thats a good thing or not is up to you to judge, but the important thing is he does a good job with the role. Vertigo is true to its title and remains one of the all time best movies from one of all time greatest directors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Not that good,"I've been wanting to watch this movie for a long time and because of the reviews, I was with high expectations about it. Unfortunately, the movie is way too slow. Some scenes in the beginning are very boring because of the poor dialogs. The acting didn't helped with that, in most of the scenes it seemed artificial. The soundtrack seems to be delayed in some scenes, killing the whole thriller. However, the plot is very interesting and the last 30 minutes makes this big waste of time into a worth it movie. The first 100 minutes I couldn't give more than a 4, but the ending is so well constructed with such a good soundtrack that I am giving it a 6 in general.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Deeply Flawed Diamond,"This is a film of very mixed quality. The first hour and 25 minutes of this 2 hour 10 minute film are incredibly, almost inconceivably, boring and consist mostly of close ups of James Stewart's face while he silently drives around tailing a delusional, deranged woman.At this point of the movie the story seems to be about a woman who thinks she was someone who died 200 years earlier in a past life. Watching this stage of the film is a profoundly boring experience and is an astonishing 75% of the movie!The characters, the situations they find themselves in and especially the dialog, everything about that first 85 minutes in fact, is so bland and boring it's hard to sit through it. After 45 minutes of James Stewart looking in his rear view mirror and mugging to the camera you need serious commitment not to abandon ship.Oddly for Hitchcock, the problem is that there is simply a complete lack of suspense. We simply don't care that she thinks she is a reincarnated woman from the 1790's because that storyline doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular as the only explanation is that the character is insane, so it isn't interesting to watch James Stewart follow her around and watch her run her delusional errandsThe last 35 minutes, from the (deservedly) famous dream sequence onward are compelling. I didn't see that twist coming and anyone who says they did (as a few reviewers claim) is lying. Incidentally, the so called plot holes are easily explained away with any number of possible explanations.For the first time there is something interesting going on. Where before the dialog consisted of banal exchanges between Stewart and Barbara Bel Geddes that simply padded out the movie and served to advance the plot by letting the viewer know what was going on (without being the slightest bit entertaining), there is a real sense of gripping drama in every exchange as Stewart the mentally fragile retired detective puts it all together and Kim Novak tries to have her cake and eat it, and almost succeeds.I give the first hour and 25 minutes 1 star because it is one of the most tortuously boring sequences anyone has ever bothered capturing on film, and the last 35 minutes 10 stars out 10, averaging the overall score out to 5 stars out of 10. If the first part of the movie was just pruned to perhaps 25 minutes long, or if it had simply been done in a more interesting way, it could have put this movie into an entirely different league.The reason this movie is so overrated (as a whole, notwithstanding it's incredibly powerful final 35 minutes) is simply because as it was unavailable for 30 years from the end of it's original cinematic release until 1986, it's legend grew and grew and it became trendy. The incredibly inaccessible nature of the first 85 minutes appealed to certain types of superficial people we all know. They will tell you that this is Hitchcock's greatest movie, the greatest movie ever made in fact, and if you don't understand that you aren't as smart as them. We know better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Excellent,"I finally watched Vertigo in its entirety. It was quite good. I've heard documentaries say that its Hitchcock's most intimate and emotional film. I most definitely agree. Jimmy Stewart gives an incredible performance. You really feel the tormented state he's in.The sets were great, which proves to be a Hitchcock norm. The music is magnificent. I won't comment on the story too much, other than to say you should give it a watch. Its quite good! Given that I am too young to have known Hitchcock's films when they were released, I am greatly enjoying the ability to go back and watch all of his films at my leisure. I can't watch one on any given night then another HC film the next night. That makes me the lucky one.Go watch Vertigo. :D",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of Hitchcock's finest,"I've seen this film several times and every time I find many new aspects to it. Of particular interest is the famous dream sequence with its highly surrealistic imagery as well as the repeated image of the painting featuring Carlotta's grandmother. These two sequences clearly foreshadow the protagonist's ultimate fate, even though this is not clearly apparent in the final shots.Hitchcock's choice of Jimmy Stewart as the lead was a good move in my opinion. His performance has the right amount of vulnerability and courage. Kim Novak is also very good as the tormented ""ice maiden"". All in all, an amazing film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Hitchcock's greatest achievement.,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, 'Vertigo' has everything you'd want from one of his films: suspense, intrigue and beautiful visuals. The film is a must-see for any fan of Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart, Kim Novak, Bernard Herrman, classic cinema or the color orange.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Timeless Classic,"Vertigo(1958) is the greatest movie of all time.  Based on a book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac that was written especially for Hitchcock after finding out too late that he sought to adapt an earlier book by them that would be filmed as Diabolique(1955).  Vertigo is an psycological thriller about obsession, misplaced love, and death.  This is a film that perfectly states Hitchcock's most personal throughts.  Two other films that dealt with sexual dominance are Notorious(1946), and Marnie(1965).Vertigo is a great cinema piece for a few reasons.  First, most of the characters in the movie are three dimensional and well defined.  Second, it uses a number of different colors to its advantage.  Third, the camera movement is beautiful and smooth. Fourth, The story is so gripping that its hard to take you eyes off the screen as you wonder what happens next.Alfred Hitchcock's direction is almost flawless and his expertise in some of the scenes is brilliant.  My three favorite films of Alfred Hitchcock has to be Vertigo(1958), Shadow of a Doubt(1942), and Notorious(1946).  James Stewart gives a complex and emotional performance as the detective who obsesses over the image of Madeleine.  Kim Novak has the most difficult role in the duel performance as Madeleine/Judy.  Bernard Hermann's score is a beautiful piece of music.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Pensioned-off detective falls for woman he surveys and loses her twice...,"This movie is the greatest film of all times.  Haunting, beautifully filmed, perplexing and captivating, indeed, it is only so in its entirety, actors, scenes,dialogue, story, taken individually would not amount to such a great deal, but as a whole, it is an absolute masterpiece.  Indeed, if it is rated 8.5 on your scale, then I wouldn't know, which movies would be valued at 9 or 10!You only have to read the Boileau/Narcejac story (on which the picture is based, to see, how much more Hitchcock created from the ""property"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Below expectations after Psycho!!,"I saw this movie knowing it's a Hitchcock's product. My first Hitchcock movie was Psycho and what a wonderful movie Psycho it is. I started watching Vertigo with similar expectations but I just couldn't feel there is any comparison. The initial portion though holds the flavor of a thriller but I guess the main feature that a thriller becomes more and more nail-biting as you approach the end, was missing. I felt the climax was pretty mundane and sort of incomplete and unjust for no reason. I'm still a Hitchcock's fan though and plan to watch all his movies, after all Psycho indeed was a masterpiece!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Over-rated sellout,"Alfred Hitchcock is the master of thrills and mysteries... so knowing that he made this just makes me hate it even more.Every old Hollywood glam cliché is thrown at you. you like elegant women staring off into the horizon? damsels in distress? Kissing on the beach and the waves crash in the background?This movie's got you covered!The plot is straight forward enough, you know what's happening ten minutes in, what the movie banks on however is your investment in the character and watching their decent into obsession.The actors were pretty good (though those eyebrows were distracting... did she use a sharpie to make them?) and the overall movie very scenic but it didn't feel like a Hitchcock movie until the very last scene, that's you're only clue to who could have this twisted sense of justice. otherwise it just felt like a sell-out, this is popular so do this, people like that so add it in...One of my least liked movies by Hitchcock, skip it and watch a good one like rear window.",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A timeless exploration of obsession and identity,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is an enduring masterpiece that delves into the darkest corners of human obsession, identity, and vulnerability. Set against the backdrop of a dreamlike San Francisco, the film follows Scottie (James Stewart), a retired detective plagued by acrophobia, as he becomes entangled in a web of intrigue and psychological torment while trailing the enigmatic Madeleine (Kim Novak).James Stewart delivers a career-defining performance, embodying Scottie's transformation from a weary investigator to a man consumed by his obsessions. Kim Novak is equally captivating, portraying Madeleine with an ethereal allure that adds to the film's mystique. Their chemistry is haunting, reflecting the complex interplay of control, desire, and loss.Hitchcock's direction is masterful, utilizing innovative camera techniques-most notably the iconic dolly zoom-to visualize Scottie's vertigo and intensify the psychological tension. Bernard Herrmann's score is a character in itself, weaving a spell of melancholy and suspense that lingers long after the credits roll.Vertigo is not just a thriller; it's a deeply layered exploration of human frailty, the power of illusion, and the devastating impact of unattainable desires. Every detail, from the meticulous set design to the symbolic use of color, contributes to its status as a cinematic triumph.Even decades after its release, Vertigo continues to captivate and provoke, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films of all time.Rating: 10/10 - A flawless and haunting masterpiece that remains unparalleled in its emotional and technical brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Most probably, the finest Hitchcock film.","Vertigo is one such film which the critics got completely wrong at the first. But, over the years, revaluation has made Vertigo stand out as one of the greatest films ever made. There is something about the film which makes it obsessive, and it's quite a thing for it concerns obsession too.Vertigo is vastly different from a regular Hitchcock movie. It's full of subtext, and, like all of the great films, it becomes better when rewatched with attention.A feature that is instantly noticeable is the use of colours. The colours used are saturated and in some sequences, which use soft focus, they give a dream like texture which goes completely in line with the character development.The camera work is wonderful, and at its epitome in the final sequence of the film. The way it goes on spiralling the staircases with Jimmy Stewart's character adds so much intensity to the screen. It is immaculately precise in making its choices and follows only the characters which add to the storytelling at the given moment. Never does it looks like the shot is incoherent with the theme and the plot of the film.In Vertigo, so much of the story is just visual. Though, the technical aspects do play their part, but a lot of this must be owed to James Stewart's splendid performance. Equally good are Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes in their roles.Vertigo is a cinematic masterpiece, and one of the reasons of Hitchcock being revered as a ' master of cinema ' and not just the ' master of suspense '.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Back when actors could act..,"So I am a bit of an action buff and get bored easy. This movie has a lot of dialog and story and while I was watching it I was wondering why I wasn't bored. I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and really found myself analyzing just why while I was watching. After a few seconds or so boiled it down to James Stewart and the director. The film has a great pacing, excellent build up when needed and a story that keeps you wanting to know just enough to make you pay attention. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie and after seeing this I'm going to check out more of his movies. The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers. The best way to watch this gem is at night and maybe with a loved one because it is kind of a romantic movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Amazing Masterpiece,"Hitchcock's Vertigo is stunning. This film is a textbook that the tutor taught us on the directing course. To be honest, I didn't know much about films before completing my film production degree, but Hitchcock's works are the cornerstone for me to explore the deeper meaning of all aspects. From the narrative perspective, the suspense built up in such a natural but thrilling way, the twist in the middle is brilliant. From the visual standpoint, a creative feature is a colour representing a particular meaning, the more times I watch, the more I appreciate this brilliant masterpiece. It's worth learning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""Citizen Kane's main rival","""Vertigo"" is Hitchcock's most resonant, inexhaustible, resonant film. The plot is no more relevant that the libretto of the best opera. It's the combined ""music"" created by the cinematography, directing, acting, and Bernard Hermann's score that makes ""Vertigo"" the screen's equivalent of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde."" There's no more spinte-tingling moment in all of cinema than Judy's transformation into Madeleine as seen through the eyes of the screen's most talented, versatile, intense, believable actor, James Stewart . No moment affirms the power of eat cinema to exert a suspension of disbelief rivaling, as Coleridge would maintain, the Almighty Creator's.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""What Dreams May Come?""","One reviewer back there mentioned holes in the plot that seem to keep the film from making complete sense.Probably the only way _Vertigo_ really makes sense is if Scotty *did* fall and *really died*.

Like in Hamlet's famous soliloquy:To die, to sleep;/ To sleep:perchance to dream; ay, there's the/  rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may/  come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil/ Must give us pause...-- Hamlet, Act III, Scene I, Lines 65-71.On this theory _Vertigo_ might be best compared to 1990's  _Jacob's Ladder_.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
overrated,"Hitchcock is, and has always been, one of the greatest directors of all time.  As a matter of fact, he's my absolute favorite.  I watched Vertigo with admittedly high expectations, and was more than a bit disappointed with what I found.  I admit Jimmy Stewart gave a fine performance, and so did the other actors, but none of them gave a great performance. Most of the plot is rather confusing and coupled with the ending makes even less sense.  I just couldn't believe anything in the movie could actually ever happen, and so it was missing that touch of realism that most Hitchcock movies have. Hitchcock did a fine job directing and Jimmy Stewart did a fine job in his role, but the plot was silly and there was plenty of padding as well (I hope you like scenes of people driving).  Hitchcock and Stewart made this mediocre movie into a good movie, but it is definitely not a great movie.Final rating: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
This Has To Be One Of The Most Overrated Films In History,"I think I made more of an effort to try to really like this movie than any film I can think of....and I finally have given up. There is something just unappealing about this story. I know two things: 1 - It's vastly overrated; 2 - It's too slow.Jimmy Stewart is fine in the lead role. That's no surprise. But his character is anything but fine, having an affair with a married woman (which never portrayed wrong by Hitchcock) and doing a few other things that left the viewers scratching their heads in credulity.""How could he be doing this if....? ""Wait, that doesn't make sense,"" etc. were just some of the comments I've heard from people watching this film.Yet, despite the credibility this films holds a big fascination for a lot of people. I gave it several looks just to see if I wasn't missing something, that the story would become more attractive as I became more familiar with it. Well, it did piece a few things together but the movie never got appealing.The only attractive part was actress Kim Novak and the cinematography, especially the scenes under the Golden Gate Bridge. That, and the fact I always enjoy seeing Barbara Bel Geddes. I was sorry her role was so short in here.Overall, I still don't see what the fuss is about concerning this movie. The story leaves me as cold as the San Francisco fog.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Haunting tale of love and loss,"To lose the woman you love once would be bad enough but to lose her twice with the added complication that she is one and the same is something altogether tragic. This film is so great on so many levels, it is hard to find the words to adequately praise it. Kim Novak certianly gave her finest performance here playing a very complex range of emotions with subtlety and a superb craftsman's touch. Stewart, in what I think is his finest role, also delivers a very multi-layered performance. There is yet another brainy bespectacled sidekick for Scottie in the tradition of Shadow of a Doubt and Strangers on a Train. Numerous San Francisco landmarks highlight the exquisite cinematography and Bernard Hermann's score hauntingly resides in the memory. The trick of zooming in and simultaneously pulling the camera back for the the illusion of depth also demonstrated great ingenuity. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
