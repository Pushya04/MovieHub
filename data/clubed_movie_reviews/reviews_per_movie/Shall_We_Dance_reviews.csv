Shall We Dance? - Why Not?,"I saw the Japanese original film ""Shall We Dance?"" few years ago and I was charmed by its subtlety and delicacy. I did not plan to see the remake because I am not crazy about the remakes in general and I did not look forward to see Lopez or Gere in the movie together. When I finally saw the movie (my mom who's seen both films highly recommended the American version to me), I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.The cultural contrast of the Japanese film ceased to exist in the 2004 movie but there is still a lot to like in it. First of all, I love to watch good dancing and ""Shall We Dance?"" has plenty of it. Gere's and Lopez's dancing together has grace and passion, and it was a wonderful moment in the film.Then, there are memorable and funny supporting characters that had screen time enough to become more than the lifeless shadows - Stanley Tucci (Link) and Lisa Ann Walter (Bobbie) for whom the ballroom dancing is the road to freedom, and happiness.And the last but not the least, the movie is asking the question, how to make a man happy if he's got everything - the job he enjoys, the family he loves, his health, and good looks but something is missing? It would take more than any movie to answer the question but perhaps it would help one day just take a different road and open a new door?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Delightful Entertainment,"In Chicago, the workaholic lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere) is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to work and stay at home with his wife Beverly Clark (Susan Sarandon) and his teenager's son and daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and take dancing classes every Wednesdays. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his ""little secret"". Meanwhile, Beverly feels the changes in her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether John is having an affair.""Shall We Dance?"" is a delightful entertainment. It is pleasant to see a nice cast like the sexy Jennifer Lopez, the charming Richard Gere, the surprisingly great dancer Stanley Tucci, the funny Lisa Ann Walter, the wonderful Susan Sarandon and excellent support actors and actresses playing and dancing great music along 106 minutes. After watching this feel-good romance, the viewer will certainly feel lighter and relaxed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dança Comigo?"" (""Dance With Me?"")Obs: On October 15th 2005, I saw the original ""Shall We Dansu?"", which is better and better than this remake.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lost in translation,"One of the worst things anyone can do is to try to tackle something that was made better. Hollywood doesn't seem to learn its lesson at all. In trying to ""Americanize"" the great Japanese film of the same name, the film makers had no idea what they were getting into. In fact, the original film, directed with great flair by Masoyuki Suo, loses all its charm with this reincarnation.That said, this edition of ""Shall we Dance"" directed by Peter Chelsom, is not a horrible movie, but the freshness and subtleness of its Japanese model was lost in the translation. While the Japanese version was light and captivating, this adaptation is a bit heavy handed. The editing of the film has a lot to do with out enjoyment, and when the dance sequences in the competition are clumsily handled as it's the case here, one wonders what could the creators have been looking at?The idea of seeing Richard Gere as the man who is intrigued by the dancing he sees as he passes the dance academy, is not as credible as one would have expected to be. Mr. Gere is versatile enough as he already showed with his role in ""Chicago"". The idea of his character pulling the wool over his wife Beverly's eyes doesn't come across as too credible. It seems to be a cultural difference that a Japanese wife might be less vocal and accepting a straying husband than in this country by an American wife. That's basically the fatal flaw with the movie, in our humble opinion.Jennifer Lopez comes across better. As Paulina she shows a professional attitude toward her students, but her chemistry with Richard Gere doesn't create any sparks. Susan Sarandon, as Beverly, the wife who suspects her husband's betrayal, underplays her role with better results than some of her late screen appearances. Stanley Tucci's character is irritating, at best and Lisa Ann Walters does what she can with Bobbie.Since you probably have seen this version, take a chance and rent the original Japanese film and compare.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Passing grade remake,"I should start by admitting that it was quite a while ago (New Years Day 1997, to be exact) that I watched the Japanese original, 'Shall We Dansu' (which, incidentally, IS THE ORIGINAL; the Astaire/Rogers 1937 flick, which happens to have the same name, IS NOT). However, although I don't remember every single detail, the essential feelings as well as some of the vivid images still seem fresh in my mind, particularly the glittering performance of Koji Yakusyo and Tamiyo Kusakari.The Hollywood remake, while not as good as the Japanese original, is at least passing grade, in capturing the essence of the film, 'a man seeking not so much a woman as an answer to his question. Why is she sad? What is she thinking' (Ebert, on 'Shall We Dansu', NOT 'Shall We Dance'), as well as everybody's passion for ballroom dancing.Richard Gere continues to exude his charm on the female audience. Jennifer Lopez, following Maid in Manhattan, continues to get more comfortable with more matured roles. Oscar best actress (and 5 times nominee) Susan Sarandon is dependable as ever. I'm trying very hard to think of a movie in which I can't find Stanley Tucci and  darn it, the more I watch the guy, the more I like him!",,Anonymous,Music
Pooor married men..,"The movie is nice, but the whole idea is so irritating... And the question the girl asks, why didn't you do this with mom... That's the whole thing.He like many other men, do absolutely nothing after getting married, taking everything for granted while the wife works, cleans, cooks and takes care of the children.And although they have much more spare time... They do nothing and then feel booored and in need of the good ol' fun times, doing the same thing Gere did, by jumping on another woman, that is care free.And while his wife is tired and lonely and in need to be appreciated as a woman, he goes... Dancing with someone else because heeeey the oldie back home is not worth asking out... Oh boohoo poor married men....",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable film just for the lessons and dancing,"Miramax made this film after a 1996 Japanese movie of the same title became a huge hit. But this film doesn't have the aura of cultural nonacceptance that the Japanese film had Without that, Richard Gere's John Clark is not so stigmatized to have to hide his taking dance lessons. Of course, he does, but It seems almost awkward and even contrived at times. We know that his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) would not be shocked to find out that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons. Nor would his coworkers. So, it comes across somewhat in this movie as though he doesn't want to advertise it because it's not the male or macho think for a man to do. As I said, it seems implied that way.Other than that, I think the characters all are good and probably had much fun making this movie. Paulina's character (Jennifer Lopez) may be just a little overboard. She comes on too strong in her dancing, for what she has experienced. The Japanese actress in that film, emoted a sense of emptiness and loss for her experience. And through the duration of the events there, she gradually recovered.This film is fun to watch, even if some of the plot is a little hokey. It's nothing special but most people should enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Standard fare, but....","this is an okay movie, especially if you are in need of something light (I hate to say a ""feel-good"" movie).Richard Gere is good, although it is sort of a surprise to see the years added to his age; Susan Sarandon is also an added plus. JLo is not really the main focus, and the side-story of Gere's passing interest in her is never developed.Stanley Tucci is very amusing as the uptight estate lawyer with a penchant for ballroom dancing (Reminded me of ""Strictly Ballroom"" from the early 90's).Basically, the film does not have many surprises, may have been nice had it ended with a twist (i.e. Gere does something spontaneous). The scene with the red rose and him in the tux is reminiscent of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" circa 1983.It would be somewhat disappointing, if the director actually did focus groups with American audiences, and this is what they prefer. Overall though, you will get a few laughs; at least this film has a positive message, and there was no gratuitous violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable but Forgettable,"Shall We Dance doesn't break any new ground but those who just want a good time will find it with this film. Richard Gere plays John Clark, a lawyer who feels the need to spice up his stagnating marriage (to Susan Sarandon, no less) by taking ballroom dance lessons from a beautiful and mysterious younger woman (Jennifer Lopez). The plot is okay it just sounds kind of boring. The movie for the most part isn't boring. Its actually quite entertaining. I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two but the original is probably better. I was expecting this film to be horrible as the trailer and early buzz weren't that good but they must have fixed the problems. The cast is pretty good with the best being Susan Sarandon. She does a very good job and she has a fair amount of screen time. Richard Gere does a good job playing John, nothing great but nothing terrible either. Jennifer Lopez's performance isn't very strong and the role didn't really seem to fit her. She gets by with an average performance though. The rest of the supporting cast are very funny and they keep this film moving. Out of all of them, Stanley Tucci was probably the best as Link. His performance of trying to be a young dancer was very funny. There are other interesting characters as well that are in the dance school and are fun to watch them. Peter Chelsom directs and he sure knows how to make this type of film work as he directed the very entertaining Serendipity. The only problem with this film is that its too predictable. Its very by the numbers and doesn't even try to stray away from the familiar path that most romantic comedies take. There was also a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Gere so there scenes together weren't very good or interesting. The running time of 106 minutes goes by fast. The dancing itself was actually pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. In the end, this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. Rating 7/10, entertaining but forgettable.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprised at the low rating,"I'm not much a fan of romantic comedy, if this movie qualifies in that regard,but the sterling performance by Stanley Tucci helped pick up the entire move in my opinion. Gere is not an action hero but everyone else seemed to me to be fine in their roles (Jennifer Lopez can dance!), the story is a bit drippy but not sopping, the dancing a treat, and as I said, Tucci's performance makes it worth watching, for me. That smile beneath a black wig is an image I will hold the rest of my life. I notice many of the poor reviews reference the original, which I have not seen. It seems a bit unfair to hate on a decent movie because the original came first. You could do a lot worse on popcorn Saturday night.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lovely to watch and charming.,"Shall We Dance is a charming movie, and not as bad as some critics make it out to be. The dance routines and the dresses are wondrous, and Richard Gere makes an appealing lead as he usually does. Susan Sarandon is also excellent. Jennifer Lopez looked miserable at times, but I can't help admitting what a lovely woman she is. Shall We Dance is well photographed, has a nice idea, and will certainly appeal to those who like romantic comedies and dancing. The script is good, a little patchy in places but not too bad, it is a tad predictable, and the direction if a little leisurely was assured on the most part. This film, despite the flaws is an appealing film, and I will definitely watch it again given the choice. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie was terrible,"I went to this movie with high expectations and was open to it when booking my tickets. I was most definitely surprised when I was subjected to this atrocity. At the beginning of this film I was so intensely bored I couldn't concentrate properly on it. The acting was appalling and even though I had extreme faith in Susan Sarandon to redeem this film however she didn't have enough screen time. Richard Gere severely boring and J.Lo's acting was the same as usual, horrendous. The concept of the film was generally creepy and the fact that Richard Gere fancied J.Lo gave the movie a seedy, uncomfortable feeling. I being someone who never even considered leaving a cinema screen before, left 25 minutes before the predictable ending. I have never in my life hated a movie as much as this. I would strongly advise people not to waste their well earned money and time on this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Romantic and life affirming,"I do not remember when was the last time I left the movie theater with such positive feelings and in such a good mood as after seeing this movie. Having not seen the Japanese original and having known only that the movie did not perform extremely well in the US, I did not know what to expect when I went in. I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is very entertaining, sweet and kind in commenting on people's little quirks. Emotionally there is not a single false moment. And there a couple of genuinely funny moments (none better than the Gere-Tucci moment in the men's room). It does help, I guess, if you are over forty (like myself) to understand the yearning of the main character (Gere) who has no reason NOT to be happy in his life, yet he cannot help but missing ""something"". I loved all the little stories of the supporting characters and I loved the fact that the movie took the time to wrap up all the stories in the end. I guess the movie underperformed because it was seen as a star vehicle whereas it is more an ensemble piece. That is not to say that Gere, Sarandon or Lopez are miscast. Not at all, in fact now that I have seen the movie twice, it is difficult to imagine a different cast, they all seem to be perfectly chosen for their parts. But it is really the supporting cast which really makes the movie work. It is difficult to chose just one, but Stanley Tucci is quite exquisite in his role. Though the movie is rather light in its tone, Sarandon character's observations on the reason why people get married is rather interesting and stays with you after leaving the theater. I hope Peter Chelsom will continue making movies like Serendipity"" and this one: there are definitely not enough movies of this kind around anymore. This is a movie I will return to each time I will be feeling down. And a special mention goes to the soundtrack. Chelsom seems to really have a hand for picking the right tunes (Serendipity soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks ever) and here the choice of the music really helps to define the emotional core of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A fun and light romantic comedy, with some script and cast flaws but a huge ammount of humor and music.","John Clark is a quiet, overworked lawyer with a stagnant marriage. Passing through a small dance school, she decides to come in and experiment, getting in touch with young Paulina, a professional Latin dancer who works there, along with the school's owner, Miss Mitzi. But it gets complicated as Clark's wife becomes more suspicious of her husband's routines.This romantic comedy has charm and knows to be interesting but is based on a somewhat predictable script that constantly suggests the romantic interest between Clark and Paulina ... the sexual tension between the two characters is palpable but such a thing never really happens. It's just a gimmick to keep the audience alert until the end. Gere is a nice actor who really looks good on characters like what he did here. Jennifer Lopez is extraordinarily beautiful but extremely serious, and her performance here is somewhat hampered by her lack of joy, playfulness and strength of character. It even seems that the actress was making the movie unwillingly. Much better was the rendering of Susan Sarandon or Anita Gillette. A word of appreciation, too, to Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter, to whom we owe most of the film's comic moments.With a good photo, well-made costumes (highlighting the dance costumes) and good scenery, the film excelled by the soundtrack, which is truly interesting, appealing, fun and eclectic.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
More Hollywood rip off!,"Hollywood is so bankrupt and bereft of ideas and original thinking that it seems that the only thing they can do is to copy and imitate badly. And so it goes with ""Shall We Dance"". Japans ""Shall We Dansu"", a charming, delightful, warm, appealing, wonderful movie is poorly imitated by the money grubbing, artless, self-centered Hollywood barbarians. It is so disheartening to see this constant parade of lumbering, badly over-acted, poorly produced, in-your-face, Californicated, tedious, ponderous, undirected, empty, Hollywood rip-offs. Is it the money or the ego that drives these people to violate something wholesome and decent or is it just plain nastiness.

"Feel Good, Magical Movie","This was a decent movie. It will never be as good as the original but it was effective and made you feel good in the end. This is the third Chelsom film I have seen. I didn't see the British movies that brought him the most acclaim but only Town and Country, Serendipity and now this one. The first was clearly a disaster. The latter two should not have worked but they do. Chelsom depends very much on the charisma of his actors to pull off his movies combined with the whimsy he adds with his direction.With that being said, Gere is very effective in his role. It is his character's likability that sells this movie combined with the colorful supporting actors that show up in Chelsom's movies that provide the final sell for the movie. I predict this movie will spawn an increase in dancing lessons. Like the movie Serendipity, people will leave this movie feeling there is magic in the air and seek out ways to find the magic in their own lives...",,Anonymous,Music
Acceptable Romantic Comedy,"If you are like my girl friend and like romantic comedies, you won't be disappointed by this movie. Don't be scared off by the low IMDb rating. It is a perfectly okay movie, albeit one that is not going to win any academy awards. If there is a weak spot in the movie, it is Richard Gere. He can often be very good, as in Chicago, or the movie where he played an Irish rebel (I forget the name). But I never can quite buy him, when he tried to play an ordinary Joe as he does in this movie. But the rest of the cast is very good and very believable. Jennifer Lopes does a great job. She does some very sexy dance scenes. I wish Susan Sarandon had a bigger part, she is very believable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm in the mood for dancing.,"Chicago lawyer John Clark is drawn to the lonely face at a dance studio window he sees from his journey home each evening. Finally one day he decides to jump off the train and go sign up for dance lessons, thus filling a void in his near perfect life. Trouble is, is that his wife thinks he's having an affair and hires a private detective to tail him.Shall We Dance? is the American remake of Masayuki Suo's beguiling and much loved 1996 picture, Shall We Dansu? Met with the usual howls of derision that comes with the announcement of another Asia remake from Hollywood, it's somewhat refreshing to find that Peter Chelson's film is actually charming and proof positive that American remakes can work if handled with care. Fuelling it with a more comedic tone than the original obviously helps the piece, and not being the kind of tacky romance picture so hated by many is surely a bonus. Outside of the zippy nature of the dance sequences, after the natural funny set up of the two left footed gentlemen, what chiefly works is the dynamic of the characters at Miss Mitzi's dance studio, each one having their own little reason for being there, as seemingly poles apart characters share one delightful goal.The cast, led by the sadly undervalued Richard Gere {John Clark}, work real well, even Jennifer Lopez {Paulina}, who at a stretch could be called an average actress, works well within the tightly scripted piece. Honours arguably go to Stanley Tucci as wig wearing, tan sprayed, work colleague of Clark, Link Peterson, whilst Anita Gilette {Miss Mitzi} is positively wonderful. Truth is is that it's an ensemble piece where it comes together nicely to form a charming picture, it's only main flaw being that we are asked to believe that modern day men feel stigmatised by ballroom dancing. Utter rubbish as far as I'm concerned, there are few things as elegant as The Waltz, or as sensual as The Rumba, and you can take that to the dance studio! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Comparison to ""Shall We Dansu, "" J-Lo Acting, and Few Comments on Dancing","I have seen the 1997 Japanese movie ""Shall We Dansu?"" only partially. The movie was successful in presenting the audience an insight about the Japanese culture, and the contrast created by the traditional Japanese family and societal values and the spirit of the Latin and Ballroom dancing.This movie does not make sense as a remake. The cultural contrast so delicately pointed out in ""Shall We Dansu?"" (1997) ceases to exist in the 2004 movie. The most important message of the 1997 movie is related to the Japanese culture. This message disappears when the setting is changed to USA.To illustrate, let's take the example of Gere being ashamed for dancing: There is no cultural reason why Gere (John Clark) would be ashamed of his wife (played by Sarandon) because of his dancing: What aspect of American culture shuns ballroom dancing? Why does he not just ask Sarandon to join him? The reason stated by Gere that he is ashamed to want more happiness in his life is absurd. There is no concept such as ""shunning pursuit of happiness"" in American culture, and as audience, we are presented no reason why Gere should be ashamed of this.Another theme in the movie that does not fit to the American culture is the reaction of Lopez to Gere when she thinks that he is hitting on her: Kusukari's (Mai Kishikawa, counterpart of J-Lo in 1997 version) reaction to Yakusho (Shohei Sugiyama, counterpart of Gere) ""This may sound rude, but I hope you don't join the class with me as your goal"" is one of the peaks in the movie where the audience is presented with the dilemma Kusukari faces as she is torn between her position as dance instructor and her cultural disposition towards Yakusho. Her reaction is soft and measured, and takes care not to offend Sugiyama. Paulina's (played by Lopez in the 2004 version) reaction is extravagant: She risks injuring a stranger's feelings to the extend that he may give up dancing, and also risks losing a potential student to an already troubled dance studio. Although her cultural disposition to the issue is much ""liberal"" than her Japanese counterpart, her reaction is much more extreme and thus unrealistic.Comments on the dancing technique: The actors could not dance. Period. This is understandable for Gere and the other students. It is unacceptable that supposedly professional dancers, played by Walter, (Bobbie) Gillette (Miss Mitzi) perform such unaesthetic wriggling on the dance floor.Final note on Lopez: It is unfair to present her acting as ""bad."" She gave the character everything that the character needs. None of the characters in the movie required too much depth. Her acting is not comparable to a professional actress such as Sarandon, however it is more than sufficient for such a shallow and unrealistic character. The fact that the character is shallow and unrealistic is the fault of the director and 2004 screenplay writer, not the actress.In addition, Lopez's dancing technique was significantly better than the rest of the supposedly professional dancers, contributing much to realism, or better stated, contributing to decrease the unrealism of the movie. Her dancer's training and background, including the fact that she actually took night dance classes when working in a law firm, makes her a natural fit to this role. Her short performance of Paso Doble set in the darkened dance studio was very well performed.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Funny, Straight Romantic Comedy","18 October 2004. This much funnier version of Shall We Dance, is a delicious, romantic comedy that doesn't require magical, unbelievable script devices to make this movie work. This movie is compelling for those who believe in second chances and first chances for those who have never taken chances. This movie comes at a good time in American life when our lifestyles are such that we may be coming to that age that for everything we have, we still are empty. I don't imagine that this movie will dazzle any male ego and will probably be restricted to females who can only wish their partners might somehow be so interested. A good date movie for the emotionally sensitive and artistically inclined. This new version based on the Japanese original explores the comic motif well, doesn't take a lot of liberties on the sexual romance angle that so often befalls American movies, and ends up with a definitely American tie off but with a much more realistic and hopefully plausible note than most gushy romance movies.

"Good, but not the original.","If you're looking for a film that you can zone out to, feel good about by the end of it, and really feel like you're dancing along with Richard Gere's character throughout the entirety of the movie, than this is the right place for you to be. A simple, light-hearted romantic (in the sense of whimsical) getaway from reality, that I'm sure more than a few hard-working Americans can relate to, who go to there nine to five jobs each and every day.There a few problems with this film, however. First of all, Jennifer Lopez. She's good...but...let's consider this. If you've seen the original (which btw, was much better than this remake), you know that it was an Asian film, and so the girl that was casted was obviously Asian. To cast, the Latino, big-bootied J-Lo, is a bit of a stretch considering that their charisma is completely different. The other problem I found, was that although it's been a while since I've seen the original, as I recall it was more of a drama, rather than a comedy, and though this isn't hysterical every moment, the remake pokes fun at a lot of what the original movie's purpose was, and this is just more comical at times, than I think it should be.All in all it's an enjoyable film, and I greatly enjoy Susane Surandon the most in the movie. I think her performance in the role as Richard Gere's wife, is achieved with brilliance, as so many of her roles are.Again, if you're looking for something very light, this is your best bet. Enjoy it, though if you're trying to decide between this and the original, stick with the first, it's much better and more realistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Better that shoving bamboo shoots under my fingernails.,"It was that time again for me to sit down and watch another chick film with my wife. She got the popcorn and I got the bamboo shoots for my fingernails. The movie was better than I expected, however. It was about this bored guy who was happily married with two teenage children. Everyday he went to the same job where he was a lawyer at a small firm and every evening he rode the same commuter train home. He loved his wife and children but was asking himself that eternal question that haunts all of us from time to time, is this all there is? Is there anything more? Until one night on his way home he looked through the train window and noticed a strikingly beautiful women looking out the window of a dance studio. Intrigued he began to look for her every night on his way home and low and behold she was there every night. Until one night he decided to get off the train in attempt to meet this woman. He signed up for dance lessons figuring that she would be his instructor unfortunately his instructor turned out to be the owner of the studio, and old bag who needed a little nip from her flask now and then to make it through another session. Until one night his opportunity came when the old lady was gone and Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) taught his lesson for that night. He seized the opportunity when upon walking her out of the studio he asker her out for dinner for which she harshly rejected him.After the rejection he soon discovered that it was the dancing that was filling the void in his life and not so much the fascination he had for Paulina.Richard Gere was good in his role as John Clark. From the movies ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago"" we all know Gere's talent as a musician and a dancer. (Both ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago"" were far superior films; ""Shall We Dance"" is not in the same league. Gere's performances in those pictures were standouts compared the movie I am reviewing here. If you have not seen either one of those films get out and rent them. If you liked Richard Gere in ""Shall We Dance"" you will love him in ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago."" The surprise for me in this movie was the performance of Jennifer Lopez. After being lamb basted by the late night talk shows for her performance in ""Gigli"" and ""Maid In Manhattan"" she did redeem herself a little here. Her talents as a dancer is undeniable and it was show cased beautifully here. She is without a doubt a very beautiful woman. I think her creditability suffers from her, self-inflicted off screen troubles, the on and off again marriages and romances, the see through dresses etc. We get a lot of J-Lo over kill from the media as well, if she changes brands of toilet paper Diane Sawyer has a 10 minute piece on ""Good Morning America"" the next day.Susan Sarandon is always solid and has that ability to make even a bad film mediocre. Stanley Tucci is good in everything I have seen him in and he has been in a lot of movies and did a good job here as well except that his role was a week one. His Character was responsible for the comedy relief unfortunately it was not funny. Embarrassing may be a better word. The wig and fake wash off suntan just did not work.All in all I have to give ""Shall We Dance"" two bamboo shoots.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Fun,"I went to this today at a Sneak Preview with my daughter. I was hoping to not be bored. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this a greatly entertaining film, kudos to the screenwriter Audrey Wells who crafted an excellent presentation from a work originally by Masayuki Suo, who wrote the Japanese film from which this is a remake. There was so much I liked it's hard to decide where to begin. At times infectious with fun and genuinely funny this is a great look at several aspects of enhancing one's life.The story was much better than most dance movies as it was less about dance and more about what it means to be human. For that we should thank Director Peter Chelsom whose only other notable work seems to be the film 'Serendipity'. In this outing, the experienced Richard Gere (who, BTW, is only a year older than me) plays a highly successful attorney bored with his life in spite of being married to a stunning and still very sexy Susan Sarandon. He seems to have everything on the surface (how could you not with Ms. Sarandon as a wife?), everything that is, except fun in his life. He longingly spies a brooding Jennifer Lopez staring out the window of an old dance studio in decline as he passes by on the L train each day as he goes home from work. She raises his curiosity enough that he thinks he wants to meet her. It's a dance studio with a sign that says that watching is welcome. Lopez immediately scoops him up for a dance class for beginners in ballroom dancing and there it takes off. His initial interest in the famously callipygous Ms. J is finally supplanted with a genuine love of dancing. He is hooked and it changes his life for the better and we have a great time sharing his new found joy. I was pleased beyond words that this did not fall headlong into what could have been a film of nothing but infidelities. That it didn't follow that path is a laudable tribute to scores of real people who do the same every day; turn away from temptation. I think this is just about my favorite role I've ever seen Gere in. He played the part with great skill and brought out just the right emotions from the audience who applauded at the end. Even the great Ms. Sarandon adds an unexpected turn as philosopher with a comment on the realities of marriage that ring fully true. She made the perfect counterpoint as the amazing superwife who made us all wonder if Gere was nuts for being so unhappy at the start.As for the rest of the cast, Anita Gillette was wonderfully cast as the studio owner Miss Mitzi. Her portrayal of the older woman who has her best days behind her is both touching and sweet without making us feel sorry for her. She seems in her element here. She did a wonderful job. Bobby Cannavale as 'Chick', whom I last saw playing a ruggedly handsome paramedic in the TV series Third Watch, did a terrific job as one of Gere's fellow beginners. He also gave one of the biggest laughs of the film just at the end. We should be treated to more of him on the big screen, he graces it well. The previously unseen Omar Benson Miller as 'Vern' and Mya who plays his girlfriend both added some warm moments of their own, his in a more literal sense. The very good Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbie, a very funny character role she wore so well she nearly owned every scene she was in. Just about the best in the film was Stanley Tucci, who did an absolutely brilliant turn as - and I paraphrase - 'Just about the only hetero guy on earth who like parading around dancing in sequins.' He was great, so great in fact, that if he doesn't get a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor award he'd be robbed. He did steal a lot of scenes with no apologies needed. He deserved every one.The rest of the elements in the film worked very well to paint just the right mood. The sets were realistic and not overly noticeable, leaving the attention to the actors where it belonged. The costuming was great and added some great moments of their own, from Sarandon in a T Shirt to Lopez in an amazing gown near the end to even Gere's tuxedos and natty business suits. But it's the costumes of Tucci and Walter that are the most entertaining. The musical score was great too, just right for the dancing and mood of the film. The sound editing was outstanding, very enjoyable.We all left the theater with smiles on our faces talking about bringing friends back to see it when it comes out. It is a film well worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"No worse, there is none","I would rather drink battery acid than sit through it again. Painful. The sort of film that makes you question your existence. Nauseating, pointless tripe. This sort of thing is usually described as a 'feel good' film, I saw it on a trans Atlantic flight and it made me want to jump out without a parachute. I am sure many would accuse me of just not entering into the spirit of the piece, after all this isn't Bergman. It is meant to be light and frothy and if we are all being honest completely unchallenging. So what is wrong with a little frivolous distraction? Well nothing in theory, but does that mean it has to be so utterly hollow? How much are we meant to care about middle class business mens mid life crisis? If you do, then this is the film for you.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Shall We Dance,"After watching the movie Shall We Dance, I could say its fair enough to compare it to Billy Elliot in the sense that John and Billy were both afraid to tell people they were taking dance lessons. This movie was considered to be a romantic comedy where a bored, overworked Estate Lawyer, upon first sight of a beautiful instructor, signs up for ballroom dancing lessons.The main character John Clark seems to be having a great relationship with his wife. But he feels like he can not tell his wife about him taking lessons. The reasoning behind this is unclear, but it seems like he will cheat on his wife with the dance instructor. Of course after watching the movie you see he doesn't commit such an act. In the scene where he travels home everyday on the train and passes the dance studio is very affective. We are uncertain if he will follow through and end up taking the lessons.When John finally starts dance lessons he really isn't that great. He hides it from everyone at home and work. His family starts to see strange behaviors in him, such as peeking in on him in his room and he is dancing around by himself. They are curious to know what he has been up to; his wife goes on and hires a private investigator to see if he is cheating on her. He then follows John and sees he goes to dance classes.The best scene in the movie is when John has to perform in the dance competition. He realizes he is really good at something and debates sharing it with his family. When his wife and daughter found out, they went to his dance competition. He messed up when he saw them and his daughter yelled ""yeah dad."" His family then walked out on him and his performance. From that moment he decided he didn't want to dance anymore. His wife wouldn't let him do that because she saw how good he was!",,Anonymous,Music
Delightfully entertaining!,"If you love dancing, you surely will enjoy 'Shall we Dance?' - a remake of the 1996 Japanese film of the same name. I'm not much of a dancer (at all!), but I really enjoyed this movie.'Shall we Dance?' is a delightful comedy about a lawyer, John Clark, who gets a bit tired of his monotonous life. Every night he rides on the train back home, and sees a dance school through the train window. One night, on the spur of the moment, he decides to enquire about dancing lessons. What follows is a hilarious journey of a man transforming into something he never thought possible. Looking for an escape to spice up his life, had far reaching results beyond his wildest dreams...I enjoyed the nicely fleshed out characters, and the ever so charming Richard Gere was good as John Clark. I also particularly enjoyed Stanley Tucci as Link, who works in John's office, and also took up dancing. I loved the music, the dancing, the characters, and it was really funny, too. I was also delighted to see - despite the possibilities - the hero remained faithful to his family throughout. This is such a feel-good movie!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
likable,"Same time every night a bored and tired lawyer takes the train home from work, looks out the window, and sees a beautiful yet sad dance instructor. He signs up for dance lessons, and although it seems he is motivated by innocent curiosity, he hides it from his wife, and the triangle begins.Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez both seem a bit too old now, but thats what the story is trying to portray, it manages to show they have emotional pasts, but the details aren't really explored. Every character has a weakness, but they seem real, and I enjoyed their progress.You wont see any great dancing here, but the music is good, the cast is likable, and it had a few laughs. I don't usually go for romantic comedies but I would recommend this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Shall We Dance?  Of Course !,"What a match-up of performers! Richard Gere with Susan Sarandon - very strange initially, but very successful. While we typically identify Mr. Gere with younger, more stereotypically ""beautiful"" actors, his pairing with Ms. Sarandon was most fitting with his role in this film.As he attempted to connect with himself, the natural entry of Jennifer Lopez into his life was perfect. It was great to see the two characters go from one end of the spectrum to another - hoping to see it go all the way. While initially disappointing (really wanted to see them together), it was a very do-able end result.Of course, the dancing and music were a great focal point to the story -I loved seeing Mr. Gere and Ms. Lopez doing their ""thing."" The statistics of the voting on this site for this film were most puzzling. One can only surmise that there were a great many voters who lack a great deal of romance in their souls. Further, as many voters must have lacked an appreciation of great music and dancing.Clearly, one of the most enjoyable films of 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Give this movie a try; you'll be glad you did.,"I was skeptical as to whether I'd like this movie. I'm not usually a fan of remakes as they usually pale in comparison to the originals. I was a huge fan of the Japanese original of this movie, so I wondered how this version would compare.I'm delighted to say that even though the storyline is exactly the same, it was not boring to see another version of this film. Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere both do wonderful jobs convincing us they are ballroom dancers and Richard Gere's ability to laugh at himself is charming. The chemistry between them is believable and adds to the movie's appeal.This is a light-hearted, fun movie; it is not an award winner or full of gut-wrenching emotion. But the reason to go to a movie is to be entertained and this one definitely does that. I saw it with three other people, one in her thirties, one in his fifties and one in her eighties and we all enjoyed it.

Could he be that faithful to his marriage and his wife?,"John Clark (Richard Gere) is actually a hypocrite that has been forced to maintain his faithfulness to his wife and his deadbeat marriage, if Paulina (Jennifer Lopez ) willingly shows that she's attracted to him and is actually in love with him. I think if Paulina says she loves him, John Clark will immediately throw away anything in his life, his marriage, his parenthood, even his career. But the screenplay cunningly not allow such situation to happen, so in the end, he cannot but to reinstate his love and faithfulness to his wife.Don't be fooled by the phony outlook of this movie, you have to admit that this guy is actually a hypocrite. It's actually a triangle intertwined situation among this guy, the dancer and his wife. He is forced to go back to his wife since the dancer only gives him an obscure and uncertain signal that makes him retreat back to his boring marriage and his lifestyle. If the dancer clearly tell him that she also has the feelings about him and asks him to be her lover, I think this guy will throw anything away and jump into her embrace. This guy is not only a hypocrite but also a coward who has no guts to change his trapped marriage.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good adaption of the original Japanese version,"Since this is a remake it is difficult to comment without reference to the original. Japanese and American cultures are somewhat different, this is a good adaptation of the original Japanese film (which I enjoyed very much - I do ballroom dance too). This too was very enjoyable. The dialogue has been updated to suite the American audience and the different cultural back ground. This makes it a more accessible version to the western audience than the Japanese version; otherwise it's a reasonable remake of a lovely film. Richard Gere, Lisa Ann Walter and Jennifer Lopez turned in good performances on the dance floor, though I must admit I liked the dance scenes in the original better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A skirt chaser turned dancer?,"Richard Gere (John Clark) is a lawyer happily married and has 2 children. Or is he really happy? In the beginning of the movie, he is looking out of the train's window towards the dance school. A beautiful girl is at the dance school's balcony and John looks interested to know her further. Conclusion he liked the girl at first sight and joined dancing to check her out. If he really love dancing in his heart, he could have joined dancing classes long ago in other dance schools. Why did he only revive his passion recently when he saw a pretty dance teacher? Subconsciously, he has thoughts of a young 'girlfriend' behind his wife's back.Now his wife. After she found out his husband is taking dance lessons behind her back. She starts to learn dancing D.I.Y at home (discovered by her daughter). Was she insecured? Is she worried her marriage is on the rocks since her colleague is facing the same problem? This whole thing is disturbingly flawed. The director should have took out the 'cute dance instructor, Paulina, standing at the dance school balcony' scene. Let John Clark sitting in the train, look at the dance school without any girls at his sight. Tell the audience that he is signing up dance lessons because of his passion. Meeting the pretty instructor is a bonus, not a planned skirt chasing scheme by John Clark.Now about the music tracks.

This was one very unfaithful remake that should not have been!,"I am so sorry that the Producer, Director, and Writer of this film did not carefully and faithfully follow the l996 Japanese film script SHALL WE DANCE. It is unfortunate that they acknowledge in the closing credits that they adapted their script from the aforementioned one.Their insensitivity to the l996 script corrupted their story to the extent I was unable to see any redeeming qualities. The apparent belief that they could ""update"" the script is almost unbelievable to me. Yet I presume that they thought this was necessary to please the American viewers as well as have it be acceptable to the global community of viewers.I do hope that this film will not be popular. I hope that some viewers will pick up that this is an attempted remake and then see the l996 Japanese version.One final note, the Japanese script could have been completely used for an American film that would have conveyed the very meaningful and rich story that viewers would have throughly appreciated.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A delightful film with a perfect cast,"Rarely does one see an American version of a foreign film that is as satisfying as ""Shall We Dance"", perhaps it's because it's possible to identify with virtually every character in the film at some level. Richard Gere is persuasive as a professional man having a mid-life crisis and charming in his shyness as he decides to learn ballroom dancing; Susan Sarandon is perfect as his first oblivious, then perplexed, wife, and Jennifer Lopez is very fine as the dance instructor at Miss Mitzi's. The tango scene between Gere and Lopez is glorious, and the waltzes are elegant. The film's supporting characters are as talented and noteworthy as the leads. ""Shall We Dance"" is one of the rare contemporary films that makes one want to see it again -- and to take up ballroom dancing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Shall We Dance?  No, we shouldn't.","A movie about a Richard Gere-looking lawyer (Richard Gere) who has a mid-life crisis and decides to take up dancing after seeing a beautiful J-Lo looking dance instructor (J-Lo) on his way home from work. Susan Sarandon stars in a forgettable role as Gere's wife.Run, do not walk to take this off your Blockbuster on-line queue.Jennifer Lopez has starred in one good movie, ""Out of Sight."" The reason that movie worked was a) she was beautiful and b) she shut up and let the real actors perform. She's still beautiful in this movie, but now she is a real-life star. That means she actually gets to read lines - lots of them - all at our expense. You know how I know when J-Lo's ruining a scene? Her lips are moving.The worst part about this movie is that Susan Sarandon would lower herself to taking a role in it. I guess after you spend screen time with Julia Roberts in ""Step-mom"" you just go numb. Maybe her and husband Tim Robbins had a bet to see who could do the worst movie of their careers. He had just finished shooting ""code 46,"" so a movie with Lopez was Sarandon's big chance.The one redeeming moment of this movie is the ending which I won't reveal, not that it matters. We wish this ending came much sooner, but at least Lopez is nowhere in sight. Here, we get a chance to see Gere and Sarandon act for the first time in what seemed like a million minutes. The movie would have done better to close with this scene. Instead we're treated to a last chance look at Jennifer's body in a provocative yellow costume, followed by a ridiculous curtain call of the movie's primary and supporting cast. Perhaps the director knew we weren't paying attention to these characters during the movie. Who knows. What I do know is these aren't the first d-list actors in a J-Lo film whose performances were less interesting than staring at her ass. Worse, they won't be the last.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A must for ballroom and J.Lo. lovers,"I love ballroom dancing and am a fan of J.Lo., too, this film was a real joy to see. Richard Gere is getting older and older again, but it was nice to see him in a role that fits his age. The two of them just made me remember those movies of Audrey Hepburn, in which she had very aged partners in her first movies.The whole movie was to me like a French film, with no so much action but beautiful pictures, strong impression, characteristic atmosphere - many moments when you just have to sit, watch, and feel. I also liked the idea that Gere gets back to his wife in the end, but J.Lo. also gets her dance, everyone is happy. There have been a number of unpolished spots, too, but I can forgive them this time.Shall We Dance was really the kind of movie I expected, a relaxing 90 minutes with an enjoyable setup and some rhythm that makes you feel to join a dancing course. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Even if it's for Free Its No Good,"Saw this film on free-to-air TV and even then felt gypped. Staying the course till the end I was interested to see if it got better - but it didn't. The main problem is Gere - he seemed to be sleep-walking through this part, and he and Jennifer Lopez were totally unengaging. It's as if both main performers accepted these roles to pay off a new house. The middle-age-infatuation-with-youth theme is not new, but in this film, what could have been innocent becomes somehow creepy. I did not see the original Japanese version that this film is supposedly based on, but I would hazard a guess that it it leaps and bounds better than this limp effort. The only redeeming factors are the performances of Tucci and Sarandon (when the script allows it) and some of the contest dancing.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Richard and JLo do not have chemistry, but, surprising- ly I thought he did with the plus size Bobinator.

winning romantic comedy,"The Japanese film, ""Shall We Dance?"" was one of the most commercially successful foreign language films ever released in the United States. The almost inevitable American remake, now set in Chicago, follows the original very closely in terms of both storyline and spirit.John Clark (Richard Gere) is a successful middle-aged lawyer who has spent virtually his entire adult life devising wills for other people. He has a happy marriage and two teenaged children who adore him, yet something still seems to be missing from his life. One night, while riding the train home as he has done hundreds of times before, he finds himself transfixed by the image of a beautiful young woman staring out from an upper-story window of a second-rate dance studio. Intrigued by the sight, John musters up the courage to get off the train, mosey on into the studio, and sign up for dance lessons. As John begins to find meaning and purpose in his life, his concerned wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), fearing that he may in fact be having an affair, goes to a detective agency, headed by Richard Jenkins, to have the man she loves discreetly followed.Gooey moments and plot contrivances not withstanding, this is a sweet and charming film that, in its own quiet way, makes a profound statement about finding meaning in the second half of one's life. Although the narrative and humor often have a sitcom feel to them, the overall breezy tone and good-natured ambiance of the movie win us over anyway. And although many of the subsidiary people who populate this tale are really more caricatures than characters, at least they're colorful and well-delineated enough to add to - rather than subtract from - the central drama.Gere, Sarandon, Jenkins, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale and Lisa Ann Walter all give winning performances. In fact, of all the actors, only Jennifer Lopez, as the beautiful young woman who teaches John a thing or two about dancing, falls short of the mark. Ms. Lopez, for all her other undeniable talents, simply has not developed an actor's confidence on camera, and, as a result, she is unable to rise to the level of the professionals.On the other hand, the dancing alone makes the film worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Okay but not as good as the Japanese version,"The film was a nice diversion for a Sunday afternoon. Since 'Shall We Dansu?' is one of my all time favorite films, I was very wary and ready to pick this one apart but Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon do well as a middle-aged couple set in to their routines of family and career. Of course we already know that Gere can dance, however, he is still realistic and lovable when beginning the lessons. Face it, who doesn't like watching Richard Gere? Hmmm? Jennifer Lopez' dancing was very good showing off years of gut-busting training, but she needs to have roles where she doesn't have to open her mouth. She is not an actress. Nice to look at, no depth to her characters. The biggest difference between the Japanese version and this one was the character played by Stanley Tucci. Although he has fun with his character, 'Link,' the Japanese actor makes the character more eccentric, absolutely hilarious and more memorable. The new friends met at Miss Mitzi's are all great fun. Even though you leave the theater feeling good, I would strongly encourage a viewing of the Japanese version.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Romantic Comedy In Years,"I absolutely loved this movie and liked it better than the original. I enjoyed the fact that the movie showed that even though you may have a so called perfect life there could still be something missing which I think most of us feel at one time or another. I found this movie to be extremely funny and touching at the same time.This movie is more of a telling of peoples lives and emotions than a story of dance. The dance helps them to bring out their inner selves. I liked the fact that John Clark (Richard Gere) reflected back on the people that had wills done in his office and that the happier ones were the ones who took that extra step to get as much out of life as they could possibly do before it was too late.This is a story about a man who does take that extra step and follows his emotions. He sees a beautiful girl in a window three times from the train each night coming home from work and one night he gets off that train in hopes of meeting this girl who works in a dance studio. He ends up signing for dance lessons hoping to be able to dance with her and instead finds happiness in dance.The movie does an excellent job showing how John Clark (Richard Gere) and the others who are inept and shy and a little ashamed at the beginning become confident in themselves. The scenes in the dance studio are extremely funny. The movie goes on to tell how his wife Beverely (Susan Sarandon) thinks he is having an affair and hires a private detective.This movie shows how each of their lives have been affected by dance. The acting in this movie is superb. Richard Gere does an unbelievable job of dancing, he is terrific. His acting is second to none and this is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen him in. This is by far the best movie I've ever seen Jennifer Lopez in, she actually does a good job. Susan Sarandon was great and would love to see her and Richard Gere do more movies together. The rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job in their roles.I went to the pre showing of this movie and the theatre was packed and some people had to turn away because there were no more seats available but they did say they would be back to see the movie when it opened up. There was a lot of clapping and laughter during this movie and everyone I spoke to said they loved it, some even said they would be coming back to see it again, as will I.This was perfectly casted movie and you won't be sorry if you go and see it.This is a feel good inside movie, A MUST SEE.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Movie,"""Shall We Dance (2004)"" was good movie and it was obvious to me that Richard Gere has more star attraction than Jennifer Lopez. I also saw the Japanese version and I liked it a lot. The inclusion of Ben E. King's ""Save The Last Dance for Me"" was wonderful. I replayed this part of the movie several times on my VCR.If there is going to be a sequel to the 2004 version, JL's role should be strengthen and there should be more dancing, more rhythm dancing (swing, cha-cha, etc). Hey, how about a subplot where Mr. Clark and his daughter train for a big competition? Followed by the main plot where Paulina and Mr. Clark dance at ""Blackpool"". Mr. Clark comes to the rescue of Paulina at Blackpool because her original partner left her for some unknown reason. I know this is silly, but its fun to describe it.Julius",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Obnoxious, unfunny tripe","Americanization of the hit 1996 movie from Japan features Richard Gere as a Chicago lawyer (supposedly overworked, yet we never see him break a sweat) who takes dance lessons at night without telling his wife--she gets suspicious and hires a private detective. Brightly-painted balderdash, wasting Susan Sarandon as the spouse and turning all the supporting characters into cartoony caricatures (often at the expense of the poor actors). The script, flabby and mean-spirited, features one witless meet-cute after another. Jennifer Lopez is lost in the vacuous role of a substitute dance teacher--always standing by a window, bathed in red light--who trades gibberish lines with Richard Gere that sound as if the screenwriter neither understands English nor Japanese!

How Can We Not Dance???,"I vaguely remember enjoying the Japanese version of this film. However I also remember its limited impact.Deep breath! My partner had tears in his eyes.

People waited until the very last credit & sound before leaving the theater.(A problem reviewers who think they're too important to be bothered by audiences face, when they sit in the cold comfort of a studio & couldn't' care less what the average moviegoer thinks.) This film celebrates the joy of music and dancing while it also explores the difficulties of marriage, growing older, and keeping long-term relationships alive.Some things we expect to happen don't. Something we expect to happen do.A lonely dancer stares out a dancing school window. An older man, Richard Gere, who's afraid his bones are turning cold looks up & sees her. He comes home to his wife and family. Susan Sarandon who loves him but feels she's being shut out of his life. As Richard Gere comes alive when he finally takes the dancing school plunge, so do we the audience and everyone in the film come alive. Richard is having such a great time learning his ballroom dancing that we can't help but take the ride with him. Problem with this film is the age barrier. I don't think anyone under 40, who is insensitive and filled with the arrogance of youth can really understand how wonderful this film is with its depth of understanding about the human condition and the joy of being filled with music that moves you to movement yourself, and, more importantly, revives your joy of life and living.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A sensible and timeless story of the heart.,"Every year, there are dozens of films made that try so hard to reach a little deeper, to hold on a little tighter, and to leave us breathless. Every year there's either one good one or (most often) none at all. This film was the exception. From the opening moment of getting to know this main character, we get the instant feel that is portrayed throughout the entire film- a feeling of real life. This movie is brilliant simply because it is so believable, and so filled with love. It grabs you from start to finish and never lets you go. It is a story about real life, and the beauty that it holds. It is a sensible and decent story that provides a look into what our lives could and should really become.This is the story of a man searching for a meaning throughout the film, only to realize that his meaning has been right in front of his eyes the whole time. An ensemble film at heart, this is one of the greatest casts I've seen in years. Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez all turn in fantastic lead performances, and share the screen well together. It's the supporting cast that really makes the movie, thoug, Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter stick out in particular as two dancers made for each other. Both actors are quickly making their way to my favorites list. The entire cast puts in superb work.Yes, it's a story about life as we all can live it. As Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez dance in the dark studio alone at night, you worry, for a split second, that the film will slip into the old and used form of movies- but it stays better. Because life is not a fairy tale and it's not a passionate romance- but if we learn to appreciate what we already have around us, we can, in essence, find the fairy tale in our own lives. And that's what makes this movie so great. It teaches us to appreciate and love the beauty of our own lives, and it's a lesson we can all learn. 9/10 stars!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Susan Sarandon is okay in her scenes (and actually good watching Richard Gere dance), but then they have an argument out of nowhere. Maybe a scene was cut. Maybe the script never made sense.

"Petr Chelsom makes a movie almost for the sake of dancing and shows its importance in the society we live in, it can be a liberating experience","Musical is a genre that resurfaces with strength and has always classics to the general public. Shall We Dance does not fit into a musical, but it has its root in concept ""talk about"" the dance. The work is nothing more than a simple homage to the purist and lovers of dance, specifically ballroom dance. Remake of a Japanese film of the same name, this American version is scripted by Audrey Wells (Under the Tuscan Sun (2003)), we can do something nice and respectful in the eyes of the audience. We cannot compare it to the Japanese film by huge cultural difference that is much more meaningful, comprehensive and complex version Nipponese. In Japan, whose culture is ancient and archaic in many ways, a man who is interested in the dancing and begins to take lessons hidden from his family was a real breaking taboos for the drive and introspective local way of life. This shift in paradigm is the big draw sociocultural to the Japanese people. In adapting the story to the American culture, Wells has other motivations to the protagonist. In this version, the man is a Chicago lawyer who handles wills, who is going through a midlife crisis and rediscover the joy of living by attending dance classes.Several years ago, lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere), a specialist in wills, leads a life of routine work to home and home to work. Despite loving his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), and their children, Evan (Stark Sands) and Jenna (Tamara Hope), John feels that something is missing something in his life. Did you see the window of a gym Paulina (Jennifer Lopez), a beautiful dance teacher.Hoping to approach her, John enrolls in the academy. However Paulina quickly eliminates any possibility of involvement with John, but this does not stop going to the gym because he falls in love for the dance. But John does not feel the urge to tell Beverly about their classes after his work time. To see changes in the behavior of her husband, Beverly hires a detective because you suspect he's involved with someone.The principle having been able to attract major stars to its cast, many thought the film would dance as background for a romantic involvement between Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere, but the film manages to be much more than that in meaning. The script focuses on the character of John Clark to show your personal rebirth to life through dance. It is true that at the beginning, the character Lopez serves to lure him to school because he always saw in the window of the dance school train when returning from work in the late afternoon. However, after he started making his first lessons, she soon removes any possibility of involvement with it, and this is the turning point of John. The character of Jennifer Lopez says that he was attending classes to try something with it, so he stopped going to the gym. And to the surprise even of John himself, he ends up coming back day after day. It is this evolution that we now see Initially unhappy with his monotonous life, John sees the dance a chance to be free, to express themselves and feel full.The transformation can also be highlighted in the character Paulina, played by Jennifer Lopez. Always passionate about dance, she had a big disappointment for a contest with the dance and your partner, and eventually returned to the United States and consciously decided to hide in the small gym Mrs. Mitzi, where he taught to his students. See along the projection that John will have an important role but in the life of Pauline, not romantically, but you bringing back the spirit and courage to return to the dance halls and competitions around the world.Richard Gere shows very brave to face dance front of the camera and its symbol of masculinity and masculine sensuality also ends up serving as a message breach of taboo, showing that anyone at any age can dance. There is no age for dancing and to be happier. It is very comfortable and the spontaneous dance scenes, and his character, showing that joy will grow gradually during rehearsals and classes. Jennifer Lopez can be interpreted happier than in his later works. She is more subdued and serious, showing all the vulnerability of her character by the events of the past. Gradually she will recover the pleasure of dance and will also stirring up emotionally by living with their students. Besides the two, we have a team of interesting supporting cast that are essential to the story. Curious fact is that Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez fought during filming, which meant that she did not participate in the film's release alongside Gere).Susan Sarandon team full of stars, playing a wife who suspects her husband's behavior and hires a detective (Richard Jenkins) and his partner Scott (Nick Cannon) to investigate her husband. Great scenes, as it should be, in the hands of talented Sarandon, especially in the climax where she ends up confronting John for not telling her anything about his new passion.Chic (Bobby Cannavale) and Vern (Omar Benson Miller) also attend classes and have short stories that are discovered along the projection. But it is the spontaneous Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter) and dancer latin dances Link (Stanley Tucci) who is executive and works closely with John during the day, providing the best scenes of humor, and also star in some scenes stronger. By Bobbie see love for dance that does go all day classes, and Link can discuss the same love for dance, and prejudice of office colleagues. So he makes the lessons hidden and when colleagues discover that he dances, has an interesting confrontation scene with fellow bigots.Another positive point is the large number of musicals we see in the course of production. Between classes, rehearsals, competitions, we are introduced to a variety of ballroom dances that pack the personal drama of the characters. For anyone who is not a fan of dancing, at least in the case of men, can delight in the curves of the body of Jennifer Lopez. Other scenes very well built can be cited, such as where the dress ripped Bobbie is a crucial moment in the plot, when Link leaves the wig away and Dancing confident then, the emotional outburst of Link with coworkers; or else in an assembly at the end when John decides to dance again and carries a beautiful dance scene workplace Beverly to the tune of ""Book Of Love"" by Peter Gabriel. Impossible not to be moved in this scene. The final assemblies with the outcome of the characters in beautiful and laborious fade out transitions devised by Peter Chelsom stands for the preparation and creativity, always at a good pace of background music.With a budget of 40 million dollars, director Peter Chelsom (Serendipity (2001)) makes a movie almost for the sake of dancing and shows its importance in the society we live in, it can be a liberating experience. There was little creative script, full of scenes already seen previously in productions of the genre and the predictability of the facts, the film could have yielded more. Paulina dramas, as well as the couple John and Beverly, for example, are underutilized, especially with major names in the cast. Either way, it is entertaining and interesting right. A film full of songs with interesting character, and that is a great tribute dance in general. As John told his wife at one point after it has been irritated by having it deleted what, ""I felt ashamed to be queer happier... when we have so much."" A plot that comes to love (by family, dancing, friends), redemption, repentance and the pursuit of happiness to make something that fills the soul and satisfy us fully.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful foreign movie ruined by Hollywood,"The original Shall We Dance from Japan was a nationwide and a cultural phenomenon, due to the main character's discovering his inner youth and zest for life while developing a passion for ballroom dancing. The main character was unhappy with the doldrums of his corporate job, and took an unusual cultural step in entering a dance studio that he saw on his way home.In the American version, Richard Gere becomes intrigued by JLo staring out the window.Wow, that's creative and different, married middle-aged man attracted to hot Latina woman. I guess the Hollywood executives who made this film thought a movie in which the main character struggles with infidelity was more sellable than simply a more innocent story about a man searching for happiness, but this premise alone completely and adversely changes the tone of the original.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Really Good Date Movie!!!!!,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend and to my surprise it was a really interesting and a really good movie. John(Gere) plays a businessman who has no fun and is doing the same thing everyday, but one day when he was going home on an El Train, he sees this beautiful woman. He then decides to take ballroom dancing, and learns that the girl in the window was Paulina (Lopez). Later learns that he and the other guys are going to a dance competition.However, his wife(Sarandon) thinks something is up and suspects he's having an affair, and what a surprise that's going to be.This movie was very good, it is far better to what I expected and all the characters in this movie were funny. All of the performances were really good, even Jennifer Lopez! Really great music and the most fun I had watching this kind of a movie.

Smitten, John joins a dance class to get close to Paulina, but soon finds the freeing nature of the art form raises his spirits and breathes life into him and his classmates (including a miscast Lisa Ann Walter and Bobby Cannavale).

I'd Rather Not 'Dance',"Sometimes it seems that the film should have been a musical. Sometimes there are just too many spots where it seems more logical for the protagonist to break out in song then deliver his sorrowful speech about the human condition. In Shall We Dance? they already have the dance aspect down. The most colorful moments are the dance sequences between Jennifer Lopez and whichever man she is pulling the hand of off her ass this time.John Clark, played by a sullen Richard Gere, is happy but not happy. He wants something more from life. Despite a successful marriage to Susan Sarandon and two kids, he feels that monotony has taken over. On passing a dance studio one night on his way home, he sees the face of Lopez from the window. She externalizes everything he is feeling inside and he finds himself compelled to talk to her. Upon walking into the studio, he finds himself signed up for beginner's ballroom dancing. You know the rest  wife fears there's an affair, Clark discovers an actual love for dancing, befriends Lopez, they change each other's life, etc.Singin' In the Rain used dancing in the place of sex. When they're dancing together, they're sleeping together. In Shall We Dance? they may have been going for something along the same line. Why else would Jennifer Lopez spend the entire movie looking like she is about to have an orgasm? It surpasses the serious dance face that some were going for. In actuality, the dancing is the best part of the movie. It's well performed, minus a few facial expressions, and obviously had the most time put into it. Richard Gere shows the he still hasn't lost what he acquired for Chicago, although that was a smarter career move.Shall We Dance? is supposed to be a comedy. There are some funny spots but mostly the problem is that the filmmakers felt a sentimental aspect was lacking and went overboard on their attempts to fix that. Every scene is rank with a brooding Gere or Lopez. The script and acting falls second to the dancing and costuming. However, if you want to see good dancing, there are so many other movies that get that aspect at the same time as the script. See Singin' In the Rain or Chicago instead of this.**/*****",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I had a good nap,"Honestly I am unsure if I can provide 10 lines about this movie. It was a good nap. I am still wondering why it was even made for theaters. Maybe it could fly as the longest most cheesy soap opera ever to air. I was in the middle of this one and started nodding off. Last time I did that was ""to die for"". ""Shall We Dance"" isn't worth time, effort, or money to see. Could have been meant for an older crowd. Crowd without vision. My mother was also bored with this told to often story. I cant say the ending was bad. I am not completely sure if he has an affair w/J lo (to sick of her) or take the high road, which is taking the wife out. Remember the film had me in a state of coma. Ya'll probably think I hate all movies. Not true, I've seen many, its hard to come up with a grand idea. At least one I'm impressed by.

Feel-bad remake of a feel-good movie,"I avoided this movie for 20 years. I was familiar with the 1996 original, that aged gracefully and is still a bliss to watch. This spineless remake shows that the problematic adaptation of the original movie setting to Western culture can't be solved by just throwing Hollywood money into it. The movie is so broken compared to the original that you can only resort to lament how memorable key scenes from the original were mishandled. The spastic direction, clumsy dialogue, dubious acting and poor casting was not part of the original. Susan Sarandon is the only one left with some dignity and real energy on this but the independent wife type is a key plot element misplaced here. The original movie is themed around insecurity but here everyone is acting cool for the camera. Maybe she should be the one dancing. Richard Gere is too charming in both real life and this movie. In the original the salaryman is well put together but is unsure about his looks himself. Lisa Ann Walter is just annoying and rude while the original character is blunt but loveable. Stanley Tucci clearly did not see the original movie and lost a golden opportunity for slapstick comedy. Jennifer Lopez is totally miscast here not because of her acting as her counterpart in the original was also not an actress. In the original the lady in the window is a sophisticated, delicate, cold and high status world professional competitive dancer. She is something unattainable for most men. Lopez is a sexualized version of this idea so the stakes are lower here. I tortured myself out of curiosity and I regret the time wasted. Long live Shall We Dansu!",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Quel Surprise,"Remakes of successful foreign films seem to be a Hollywood passion. The simple reason is profit. So, that they turn out stuff that tends to be pale reflections of the originals is no surprise. Sadly, this too is a poor imitation of the original. However, the surprise is that it does have so much charm. Keeping the original screenwriter and having a talented cast surely helped.Usually, I rail at the travesty done to originals and continue to do so, but I accept that many films which would receive scant exposure have a chance to reach the English only audiences through these remakes. Now, I tend to accept that the price of experiencing good film is having to sit through these remakes and then to seek out the originals.If you like this film, you will adore the original. Some others such as ""Nakita"", ""The Vanishing"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Last Man Standing"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" have overseas origins. If you make the effort to track down their progenitors, wonderful treats await you.A cautionary note - It is always wiser to watch the remake first; then the original. That way you can avoid disappointment - the experience gets better each time. Also, when searching for the originals - the titles may be translated very loosely. IMDb is a great help in title searches and ""Comments"" will usually offer up the original title.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A real sedative,"I recently rented the DVD and although it only cost me 1 Euro it wasn't really worth it. The story is so horribly put together that it makes you start yawning after 10 minutes of watching. You can tell that the actors had as little enthusiasm performing in this movie as the author had writing the script. There is not one single new element in it; every scene seems like a bad copy of something you have seen done better in a different movie. (If it takes a good actor to cover being bored by the script then Susan Sarandon gets the prize for this one. Everyone else in the cast is just openly unwilling to perform, especially Gere and J Lo.)If you like romantic comedies with Richard Gere: skip this one and watch ""Pretty Woman"" instead.

"Good acting, great music and greater dancing!","My wife and I really enjoyed ""Shall We Dance"". I appreciated that Richard Gere's and Susan Sarandon's marriage was portrayed as realistically as possible given the plot circumstances. She wasn't a movie-style shrewish wife and he wasn't a sarcastic, smart-aleck husband. Jennifer Lopez acted surprisingly well. Not only is she gorgeous, but her dancing was excellent. (I was shocked to learn that she had never ballroom danced before filming ""Dance""). As I am a Black man from Chicago (and the movie is set there), I appreciated that there were two likable, African-American characters in the movie. Nick Cannon (who was great in ""Drumline"") had a small, but smart and well-written role. Addressing the comedic side of ""Dance"", Stanley Tucci was very funny! I think it took a lot of guts to play his ""two"" characters. Aside from one major F-word (from Tucci) my wife and I liked that there was very little profanity in ""Dance"". People do actually talk without cursing every sentence. Also, since Gere's character truly loves his wife, I REALLY liked how Gere's late-night dance scene with Lopez concluded. I enjoyed ""Shall We Dance"" more than I thought I would. And if you like good acting and great dancing, you'll enjoy this movie too. [7 out of 10]",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The Joy Luck (Dance) Club,"SHALL WE DANCE? (2004) *** Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Anita Gillette, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Benson Miller, Richard Jenkins, Nick Cannon, Mya. Pleasantly charming remake of the 1997 Japanese film of the same name with a never before better Gere (very carefree and letting down his guard), a decidedly cast-against-type, as a mild-mannered happily married family man and bored accountant in Chicago who one day impulsively gets off his commuter train to go to the beacon of a dance studio he passes each day featuring the lovely Lopez as a sad instructor who he attempts to get to know while rekindling his joy for life.Well cast ensemble including Gillette as the owner of the studio, Cannavale and Miller as rookie dance students sharing Gere's time and Jenkins as a private eye Sarandon, Gere's beloved spouse, hires fearing the worst about the sudden change in her mate's demeanor. Tucci steals the show as a colleague of Gere's who gets in touch with his inner Ben Stiller, as a nerd with the heart of a Latin dancer and Walter gets in touch with her inner Bette Midler as a professional dancer who speaks her mind in all its brassy detail. A hoot and a holler with fine comic moments and some sweet stepping to the light fantastic. (Dir: Peter Chelsom)",,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable romantic comedy,"Richard Gere plays John Clark, a rather uninspired lawyer who feels his life needs some form of life injected to it. Happily married (to Susan Sarandon no less) with two children, John still feels like there's something missing. John decides to enroll in a dance class and finds that he truly has a passion for it and that it makes his life more enjoyable.Many reviewers compare this film to the Japanese original and it seems this version suffers in comparison. I have not seen the Japanese version but I liked Shall We Dance quite a bit. The fact that Gere's character felt there was something missing despite him having a good life is a feeling I think everyone can relate to, to some extent. Feeling guilty about wanting something on top of what he already has makes the character more real, to me anyway, and it explains well why he kept it a secret from his wife.Gere's moments in the dance class provide the film's real laughs and it's fun to see those guys get the feel for dancing. Jennifer Lopez, for once, gives a good performance as the moody dance instructor and her low-key presence is a huge plus. Where the film falters somewhat is when Sarandon hires two private detectives. Their characters are a little too silly and they don't fit comfortably in the film as a whole.Overall I found Shall We Dance to be an enjoyable romantic comedy. Gere and Sarandon are both very good, Lopez as well and the supporting actors give their all to please the crowd.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

His wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) gets suspicious and hires Devine (Richard Jenkins) to investigate.Richard Gere is too suave for the role. I think he should be a meek office drone. He should at least be somebody more adept at comedy. Stanley Tucci is insanely hilarious as one of the students. That's the tone that the movie needs more of.

Chelson's atrocity against the Japanese,"The central tension in the original Japanese Shall We Dance is that the main character is a dork, a nerd, a nebbish that has to overcome social taboos to pursue his passion.Since neither apply to suave Richard Gere in the socially unfettered USA, Chelsom resorts instead to a commentary on materialism. A nice try, but a pale imitation. Without the central tension, the film is effectively castrated.The large cast of quirky but likable characters don't quite work and come off as flat and stereotypical, the one exception is the PI's preternaturally wise assistant who gets far too few lines.The only redeeming point of the adaptation is Susan Sarandon's performance despite the poor writing, and watching Jennifer Lopez dance. Lopez fully embraces the venerable dance of ballroom and truly invigorates it with her raw sensuality. A delight to watch.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"watchable, but that's about it","The Japanese movie Shall We Dansu was charming, funny and a bit of a mess. This remake actually fixes some of the weaknesses of the plot but loses way too much of the charm and humor.You really can't expect a lot from a movie starring too of Hollywood's least charismatic romantic leads, and it's no surprise that Gere and Lopez turn in forgettable, generic performances. Arguably this is acceptable from Gere; he plays a rather colorless drone to begin with, but it would be nice if Lopez had shown a little spark. She's pretty awful in this, tending to seem colorless but occasionally reaching the point of tears with little justification.On the bright side, Lopez's turn around isn't as jarring as in the original, and Gere's behavior and his wife's makes more sense. This is not to say that the movie isn't painfully Hollywood, but its probably no worse in the respect than the original. And the supporting cast is decent, although Stanley Tucci isn't nearly as funny as Naoto Takenaka was in the original.The last thing to note is that the dancing is poorly filmed. Now, this isn't a dance movie per se, it's a movie about how dancing effects people, but one still would expect the few dance scenes to be competently filmed. Instead, one gets no sense of movement or dance throughout the movie; the camera seems to unerringly go the opposite direction from where it should.None of this makes it a horrible movie, but it's certainly a weak one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A break from the norm to see the true light of ones self,I liked the movie. Yea it was a typical romantic feel good kinda movie that usually turns me off but it was great the way the personalities of the characters meshed to help each others neurosises.(if thats a word)mainly because they were nobodies and they were immediately likable and believable. I would have appreciated the regular guy role more if a more affable actor like Matthew Perry or even Tim Robbins might have been more a rags to riches transformation rather than a sex symbol like Gere whom ladies already associate that way. My wife even though Kevin Spacey might work but I like Spacey as a the sly wit and intelligence that he usually plays although I understand he would have a background that would fit the bill for ballroom. Susan Sarrandon one of my all time favorite ladies seemed wasted but I've seen her in a few low key roles and she makes the best of her screen time.

You'll leave the theater feeling good,"I have to disagree with the previous poster. This is not great art, for sure, but it is good entertainment.

Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter as Link and Bobbie, respectively, are alone worth the price of admission--they are NOT miscast. (Stanley Tucci's wig and false teeth may be miscast, but not him.) Susan Sarandon is totally professional, as usual, and looks fabulous for her age (dammit). It's hard to believe that a guy could look like Richard Gere, be married to a woman like Susan Sarandon, and live a boring life, but hey, this is the movies, you have to suspend disbelief.

Good But Too Much Melodrama,"I found this movie to be well acted and with quite entertaining scenes that kept me interested for most of the movie. It was well acted by virtually all of the actors, without anyone being particularly outstanding. Where the movie fell down in my opinion, was that it was too melodramatic. I thought that there were too many scenes where the reaction or rather over-reaction of the characters was far to pronounced. I almost stopped watching it for this reason. I persevered with it however, and my final view of it as a movie is 6 out of 10. From my point of view, the director must take responsibility for that, because it could quite easily have been a far better movie. In some cases, humor could have been used in place of the melodrama to a far better affect.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Shall we say no?,"I give this three stars out of ten because of Richard Gere. Where can I start. Jennifer Lopez, it seems, has been taking dancing lessons since her breakup with Ben Affleck but her acting is still atrocious. She should have done the reverse. As for Richard Gere, I think he should punch out Julia Roberts for sucking up all his energy when they made Pretty Woman because ever since that movie, all his movie projects thereafter have been boring to terrible.The story is about a wills and trust attorney, played by Richard Gere, who in his middle age, married to wife (Susan Sarandon) and two teenage children, finds his life a tedium until he sees Jennifer Lopez peering out of a window of a dance studio, while commuting to and from work. He takes dance lessons to meet Jennifer Lopez but instead finds his passion renewed from learning how to dance.The part where Richard Gere is trying to learn how to dance was funny but that was about it. The rest of the movie is pretty much boring. I cannot attribute that to the acting because everyone gave a good performance but the story and script did not match the acting.Oh well, better luck next time Richard Gere.

"As light and silly as you expect, but not as formulaic","""Shall We Dance,"" a remake of a Japanese film I have not seen, looks like it's going to be an ancient formula picture: bored married man spots beautiful dance instructor; they dance; tension; sex; conflict; happy ending. Yet it somehow manages to break free from the mechanics of these movies, and I found it surprisingly entertaining. It does not offer any insight, and there are no scenes in it which have any weight (although there are some that think they do), and yet its characters do not feel like they are trapped in a plot. You actually feel like the characters, however lacking in depth they are, make their own choices. It scrapes a pass.Richard Gere plays a lawyer married to a... well, her job has something to do with fashion, I think. She's played by Susan Sarandon. The Gere character feels his life has grown monotonous and repetitive, and his marriage stale. His name is John, but you've probably already gathered that.Every day, on the train home from work, he looks up at a certain station and sees Jennifer Lopez looking out the window of a dancing studio. Soon enough he is signed up for dancing lessons. Well, one can hardly blame him. The problem with seeing Jennifer Lopez in any movie is that she makes everyone else look like... well, like mere human beings.The dancing school is filled, naturally, with a Cast of Colourful Characters. Omar Miller is the overweight man trying to lose some weight before his marriage, and Bobby Cannavale is the lady's man who believes that if he can dance well, women will drop to his feet. The school is owned by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), whose smile, we suspect, hides the tracks of her tears (the way she knocks back booze from a hip flask when no one is looking is a dead giveaway). Lopez is Paulina, a professional dancer who is sick of people joining dance classes to get in her pants.John keeps his dancing from his wife, who begins to suspect, inevitably, the he's having an affair. In an absurd but amusing subplot, she hires a cartoon private detective to follow him around. Another subplot involves Link, a co-worker of John, played by Stanley Tucci. He is a serious businessman who watches a lot of American Football, but who secretly, Gere discovers, goes to dancing lessons too, wearing astonishingly flamboyant costumes. Well, the trailer gives that away anyway. Tucci often plays characters with a business-like seriousness, as in ""The Terminal,"" and in this movie I liked the way that the seriousness is actually masking his inner extrovert.You no doubt think you know where the plot is going, and you would not be entirely wrong. You would also not be entirely right. We suspect that sooner or later Gere will sleep with Lopez (or, at least, kiss her), but no, their brief flirtation leads to some sweaty dancing in place of a sex scene. Gere doesn't have much of a sex drive in the movie; we suspect that he really does just want to dance with Lopez. I guess I'd settle for that.I don't know how closely the movie follows the Japanese original, but on its own, it's entertaining enough. It's light and fun, and it doesn't execute its story in the ways I expected. Yes, it leads up to a big dancing competition, but even then it doesn't pile on the clichés. Most of its appeal comes down to the actors; Gere has effortless charm (though not much else; he's completely unconvincing when he tries for the big emotions), and Lopez is simply a star, in the best sense of the word. John's two children are almost embarrassingly phony (the movie could have done away with them completely, no harm done), but the sense of fun that the movie has is contagious, and I caught myself smiling enough to recommend it. Part of the reason I liked it is that it rarely felt like it was trying too hard for the smiles.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Shall We Dance?,"Dance. Secretly everyone longs for and has a desire for dance. Though it requires the perfect harmony of the soul and body of the partners anyone who has ever danced knows that the feeling is wonderful and rewards for every desperate moment of preparation.The protagonist of the film ""Shall We Dance?"" is an initially boring and unhappy estate lawyer called John Clark (played magnificently by Richard Gere). He secretly engrosses in ballroom dancing and soon he finds friends and a subtle kind of love with the beautiful and enigmatic dance teacher, Paulina (played by Jennifer Lopez), who has a passion for dance but seemingly something hurts her. Later John's jealous wife turns up at the dance competition and something tragic happens. However, everyone finds his/her true love in the end.Every moment of he film holds the attention of the cinema-goer. Half of the film consists of impressive dancing scenes. Lopez acts incredibly as the sensitive beauty hiding a harm of the past and dances excellently. Though Gere can be still charming to women we should admit that the age of 56 is not the most appropriate to pick up dancing.All in all, ""Shall We Dance?"" is an excellent movie about a recently neglected but otherwise beautiful pastime activity. I can recommend it to everyone who likes romantic comedies and dance and is interested in the story of a shy but kind-hearted middle-aged man who finds happiness in the joy of dance and opens others' hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun!,"A remake of a award-winning 1996 Japanese film, 'Shall We Dance?' is indeed an interesting and fun flick to watch and remember. It's got a charming plot, coupled with competent performances and worthy direction.'Shall We Dance?' tells the story of a man, who despite having a lovely family, believes his life is nothing but work. He, however, gets his 'un-worthy' life back in shape through dancing.'Shall We Dance?' is a terrific idea, and this is a fun remake. What works the most for this flick, is it's unpredictability. A guy gets back in shape through Dancing, and keeps his journey interesting, cool indeed!Peter Chelsom's direction is worth a mention. Well-Done! The Screenplay is cool. John de Borman's Cinematography is nice. The Editing is apt.Performances are rocking: Richard Gere is fabulous. The veteran actor dances gracefully and plays his part with restrain. Jennifer Lopez is superb, her dances are indeed a treat to watch. Susan Sarandon is tops. Stanley Tucci is fair. Lisa Ann Walter is in terrific form. Richard Jenkins is fantastic, as always. Anita Gillette is lovable. Omar Miller is good. Others lend able support.On the whole, We Shall Indeed Dance! Go, Have Fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Disqualified,"Sometimes you see movies that exemplifies just what a machine Hollywood is. Movies are rushed into becoming productions almost like exploitation films. You like dancing? Oh, we've got just the movie for you! Look at the box cover, that's Richard Gere! And isn't that smile of Jennifer Lopez' just adorable? And that's that Sarandon woman too, yes, I remember her from that death row movie whatever it was called... it won't matter that the screenplay is a parade of dangling loose ends and that the movie presents some stunning contradictions in their vacant characters, the frame will be glued together by some good acting and a lot of rumba, shot in close-ups.To conclude an even more un-original trait of the movie, it's a remake (what do you know!) to a Japanese movie which I have not seen. I wouldn't know the similarities between the two movies then, but I suspect that the original movie was consistent enough to make you understand what it was about. This 'Shall we dance' leads you astray very early on, and keeps you out of focus and end up with a happy ending which leaves you unsure about what the problems the characters had in the first place. Clearly, you are not meant to think too much when you watch this movie.Well, sorry, my bad, but I kept using my brain upon watching this movie. We are introduced to Richard Gere's character, a happily married lawyer who likes his life but, apparently, ""something's missing"". It never gets specific, but he does become interested in the beautiful face of Jennifer Lopez on the subway. It turns out that she's a dancer, working as a teacher at a night time dance class. She used to compete for real, but it went bad with a partner that was more than just a dance partner. Anyhoo, Gerie stops of the subway to check in at the dance hall and subsequently starts to hang out there frequently. He learns to dance. Is he really interested in Lopez? Maybe, maybe not. He however keeps his mouth shut to his wife, played by Susan Sarandon who eventually starts to get suspicious.Now what this movie at one level at least tries to be (I guess there was some kind of real motivation involved in the making of it) is a movie where a guy who's got it all gets intoxicated with dance because it gives him something exciting next to his satisfying but mundane life. But regardless of what the idea is, the movie starts out as a drama about adultery. The dancing is shot straight, and when the characters start to get ready for a dance contest - which is what the big showdown of the movie is supposed to be all about - it's impossible to care about any of it. The elephant in the room is Gere's marriage, and the question ""what the hell is he doing?"" somehow switches to ""aw, who cares, look it's a dance contest coming up!"" But I really can't imagine anybody getting a high temperature out of Gere trying to dance waltz in a series of medium close-ups. Compare it for instance to Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom. Now there was a movie all about dancing. We are led to believe that this movie is about Gere and his unspecific affection towards Lopez. Then we are to believe that it's all about the magic of dance. But there's no magic involved. It's stale and dead, and while the director is the most guilty I think a lot of the failure lies in Gere too, who is far too robotic and two dimensional of an actor to express a character like this. When he says that he got to like dancing, I'm not really getting in the mood to take classes. Lopez is another story, not just because she is a natural born dancer but also because she's an underrated actress who makes quite a believable and realistic girl next door-type of great and professional dance lover. Many other actors serving as comic relief are also good, Stanley Tucci for instance, but they are definitely by the numbers.But by far the greatest problem I had with this movie was letting Susan Sarandon play a semi-hysteric role, making the worried wife a comic relief. She becomes the visible object of the big flaw of the movie - What is it supposed to be about? Does she ever find out that her husband went to take dancing classes by following a beautiful young woman he got interested in? It's as if the movie forgets about this along with Gere's character and that's just, if not an outright shame, than at least sloppy storytelling. We don't get to know anything about how Gere's life was changed by his dancing experience. We don't get to know if the marriage is flawed, or if Lopez' character was a threat to it. Or what any of the events in the movie actually mean. It all ends up utterly pointless.As passable enjoyment I accepted this movie about one third into it before I found it totally lost it's concepts. After that it was straight downhill and I just wished somebody could have come along to clean up the script and switched the director. You know, made the same movie only better... oh, wait a minute, right, there was the Japanese original. Better check it out.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great!,"I loved this movie! It was a beautifully crafted film. Without being profane and with no over the top special effects, this movie was throughly enjoyable. Jennifer Lopez did a wonderful job, it is a credit to herself and the movie that she was able to learn the dances and portait them authentically. Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon had awesome chemistry and did a great job. It was so refreshing to see that Lopez and Gere did not have an affair as I thought at first. They just had a great friendship. Although there dance scene was very steamy! All of the characters shine in this lighthearted but full of meaning movie. Please go see this film, you will not be disappointed!",,Anonymous,Music
Slightly schmaltzy 'chick-flick' light drama that's a must-see for those in a mid-life crisis,"In director Peter Chelsom's 2003 light drama ""Shall We Dance"" nondescript NY lawyer Richard Gere is happily long-term married to Susan Sarandon... yet feels something's lacking. Drawn by moody instructor Jennifer Lopez he secretly joins Anita Gillette's ballroom dance class (with the likes of Bobby Cannavale, Omar Benson Miller, Stanley Tucci & Lisa Ann Walter) and surprisingly takes to it. Meanwhile Sarandon suspects he's having an affair so hires private dicks Richard Jenkins & Nick Cannon to trail him.

Better than I anticipated.,"I was lucky enough to get to see an early screening of this movie last night.I loved the Japanese version of this movie, and was frankly dubious regarding its translation to an American modality. The premise in the original is that the gentleman is culturally ingrained to be ashamed of public displays. I thought it might be difficult for anyone to convince an audience that a middle aged American man had that problem.They solved the problem by ignoring it and creating another form of tension in the form of the American accountant feeling guilty for his lust for the dance teacher (Jennifer Lopez) and not wanting to admit it to his wife and family.The dancing was fun, the costumes were fantastic. Stanley T. was exemplary.The man who played the detective, and his assistant were both outstanding.I liked that a number of the scenes were true to the original.The vignettes at the end, where it wrapped up the lives of all the persons in the movie seemed a bit like overkill, but then, it was nice to know what happened to everyone. I could have done without the scene in the gay bar though.Al in all, it was a fun movie. Definitely enjoyed seeing it. The actors and film crew did a good job bringing a viable version of the story to the American screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bravo,"A fantastic movie that touches all emotions. A precursor to the dance revival taking place for middle-age America today. Great acting and writing. I have viewed this movie many times. I highly recommend the Japanese version to everyone. Despite the fact that it is in another language it will consume your attention. I like the Japanese version as well if not more than the American one. The fact that dancing for men in the orient is a greater taboo adds to the story.The attraction that dance holds on human beings is demonstrated so well here.The soundtrack will move and stimulate every emotion from love to lust. Dancing: ""A vertical expression of a horizontal wish."" How true and during the Tango scene the point is well appreciated. See it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A sheer dancing phenomenon that is filled with charisma and beauty.,"A rare remake of the 1996 Japanese movie, Shall We Dance waltzes into cinemas in glitzy Hollywood style.From the director of the 2001 classic Serendipity, Peter Chelsom has created a sophisticated romantic comedy about the realms of ballroom dancing.Set in a modern America, an overworked estate lawyer, John Clark (Richard Gere) feels something is missing in his life and while returning home one evening he notices a beautiful dancer, Paulina, staring out of a window of Miss Mitzi's dance studio; he sees the passion in her that is sadly lacking in him.After gathering the courage to meet Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) John joins the studio and to his surprise becomes transfixed by a newfound love of dancing that fills the void in his life.Meanwhile, at home his beloved wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) knows nothing of her husband's new hobby, as he has not had the courage to tell her. She becomes more and more suspicious and fears the worst about his whereabouts, eventually hiring a private detective. John soon feels that his dancing may be putting his marriage in jeopardy and he must act before it's to late.This is a cheesy romantic comedy about a hobby that is passionate, inspirational and magical.The standard of acting is very high with Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon in superb form; the dancing skills of Richard Gere is also impressive as he waltzes into the sunset with Jennifer Lopez. Her natural beauty and radiance is highlighted throughout the film.Also watch out for a promising performance from Omar Benson Miller whose larger than life personality made me laugh during his role of Vern.So all in all this is a Hollywood remake which isn't as good as the original but worth seeing. Although it will probably be more successful on video than at the box office as this is a movie that shouldn't have been released on the silver screen.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
a great lesson of love and dance,"I recommend this movie to everybody. It is very romantic and passionate. It is also about loving somebody and showing that to the person you love. It underlines the importance of living with somebody, of witnessing their live and of supporting and accepting their needs. A great lesson of true romance and the most beautiful expression of what a marriage should be. As for the performance of the actors, they did a great appearance in the movie and gave that special something to it. Richard Gere, with his charm, gave life to the bored lawyer that found a great relief in the dancing school. Also, Jennifer Lopez proved to be a great actress. As a fun fact, the movie got me into taking dancing classes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"7/10 Very enjoyable, good acting minus JL, well-paced, few faults.","I liked this movie a lot. I laughed far more than I expected, and the movie was fairly faithful to my memory of the original. Note I say 'my memory' because I saw Shall We Dansu about three or four years ago and I loved it. (I recommended it to anyone who would listen. I still love it, and I recommend it to you. Back to my review.)Acting: Jennifer Lopez Should not have been cast because her acting talent is wanting. I found it odd that someone who's been hassled so much lately has a problem acting cold. (I could rant a little but I won't.) Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon did a fine job and created a believable couple. Susan Sarandon pulled things together in my view. I liked the PI, he was very good. Gere's dancing office mate also did a fine job, but the believability of that character is the responsibility of the director. The actor did well with what he was given.Plot: Someone else said that the original worked better in the framework of Japanese culture. I agree. This movie had to make some concessions to work in an American setting.Directing: Hmm, pretty good I'd say, except for JL. Perhaps he did his best with what she had to offer, maybe they did 50 takes on her scenes, who knows. The pace of the movie was quite good, and that's important. These psudo-family dramas need to keep moving in order to keep me from falling asleep. This director kept things moving.In summary, I really felt this had lots going for it. I am surprised to see that the viewer rating was bumped down to 5.8/10 (932 votes) as of my writing this review. It's better than that, if you can excuse a few minor things.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
good one if you want to chill,"Sometimes you're in for the action, you want buildings and cars to blow up, people to get shot and plains to crash. Rough dialogs, good looking girls and special agents. This movie is not nearly like that. Nothing big happens, no one ever gets mad and the story is pretty simple. Its fun at some point but you can see that romance is at the first place. The acting is OK, not too good if you ask me but just enough to get you through the movie. On the other side, the characters are interesting and you might find funny points in the movie. You might ask yourself what the outcome might me because of the relation between the characters so that the ending is not predictable.

It has a constant stream of great music that lifts the atmosphere of the film. The dances are elegant and enjoyable to watch. The fun script also helps the entertainment value. The three student all have different reasons why they start dancing, and it is satisfying to see them carry through the quest to learn dancing.

Dirty Dancing for the Mature Folk!,"It has a great cast with Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere as a married couple in Chicago. Jennifer Lopez has a supporting role as one of the dance instructors and Stanley Tucci who is always fabulous plays one of Gere's colleagues and dance enthusiast. Anyway, the plot about the husband going to dancing lessons and the wife suspecting that he's having an affair is a bit far-fetched but the cast works well together even if the storyline is weak. They filmed some of it in Chicago, a great city to visit. Anyway, the film is somewhat corny and predictable about the dance contest. Still it can be worth watching anyway with a great cast and crew. I forget who played Bobbie, the star dancer, she is familiar to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A more than pleasant diversion,"OK, I went to see the preview of ""Shall We Dance"" tonight. First of all, the movie itself is pretty good, if not great. Briefly, what works about it is that the things that you expect to happen in a romantic comedy, especially as you are watching it, don't necessarily happen. I won't say anymore in case I blow the entire plot. And while it's not laugh-out-loud funny all the time, there are a lot of nice moments, and the film has a lot of heart. And everyone in it is good, even Jennifer Lopez, who actually isn't in the movie a lot. This is really Richard Gere's film, and he does a great job in the role of a happily married, successful man who is just missing that certain spark in his life and finds it in an unusual place.This will be a great date movie, a nice way to spend an afternoon and evening. I don't know how it will do at the box office, but I can see it have a lot of success on DVD.

Enjoyable but Lopez ...,"In ""Shall We Dance, Richard Gere has taken a page from the 'James Stewart' book and has created a sympathetic, engaging 'everyman'. Susan Sarandon is fun to watch, as always, and the supporting players create wonderful characters and moments. The fun of the film is maintained right to the end and doesn't fall prey to pretension. HOWEVER, having gotten addicted to the Australian version of ""Dancing with the Stars"", my wife and I simply did not believe that Jennifer Lopez's character had ever been a top professional dancer. Adequate for a singer/celebrity, but not otherwise. And mostly wooden acting from her, as well. Sigh.

Trying to improve on a good thing,"I am a ballroom dancer. I saw the original Japanese version. I thought that version had a bit more humanity to it than the American version. This version was a bit too Americanized. The main plot was not believable. The actors could have been better chosen. While Jennifer Lopez is a dancer she is way out of her league with the main players (Gere & Sarandon) and the supporting players (Tucci & Gilette). She is unable to convince an audience of her character. One never forgets it's her playing a part. The background for her character as the daughter of a dry cleaner inspired to do ballroom because she liked the costumes is a bit of a stretch. Anything could have been more believable than that. The Bobbie character was a bit too contrived. Her fixation about her ""Butt"" was over the top and unnecessary. Maybe this was an in joke about JLo's butt. I don't know.I did enjoy the ballroom dancing. It is clear that Richard Gere and the other two students put more time in than JLo. Stanley Tucci certainly pulled off the comedic element of the character. However he was no ""Mr. Aoki"" as from the Japanse version. All in all this is nothing more than a ""B"" movie version of an ""A"" movie foreign film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Nice ""family"" movie","I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it could have been better by eliminating a couple of scenes, but it is totally fun to watch and there was lots of nice music as well.Jennifer is a great dancer and a very sexy lady. I never really thought her acting was the best ever, but in this movie she did well. In addition, her role centred on her dancing not dialogue.Susan Sarandon is a great actress as usual, and the role fits her well and Richard Gere is actually very funny and his character is absolutely likable. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Link and I am not sure how many scenes he appears in, but they were quite a few.The movie is a total success as a remake of the Japanese Shall we dansu? I believe it was well translated into the North American culture without imposing any foreign cultural traits which the American viewer would not understand.I only gave it a 7 because of what I mentioned about the unnecessary scenes (I will not specify so that they are not spoilers).Finally, I think the movie is clean enough for an enjoyable afternoon with the entire family. I am very surprised with the US PG-13 rating. In Canada it is more appropriately rated as PG.

"Should be called ""Silly Dunce""","In ""A Gift from the Sea"", Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote, ""A good relationship has a pattern like a dance ... There is no place here for the possessive clutch, the clinging arm, the heavy hand; only the barest touch in passing.""If only the screenwriter of ""Shall We Dance?"" had heeded this sage advice! This American remake might then have maintained the grace, charm and delicacy of the Japanese original.Alas, instead we have the ""heavy hand"" clobbering the audience over the head with the clumsiest lack of subtlety, the broadest stereotypes, a lackluster script and -- as a result -- a singular lack of true-to-life characters that we feel for and care about, a woeful absence of on-screen chemistry among the principals, let alone the bit players.Stanley Tucci should sue his agent for landing him the part of Linc, the bald solicitor who expresses his ""true"" inner self by donning a wig worthy of Tiny Tim and gaudy satin tights like some flamboyant superhero. His desire to dance and be himself is cruelly ridiculed by co-workers imbued with American culture's narrowly defined notions of masculinity.Bobby Cannavale should be shot for accepting a role where (yet another) character ""plays it straight"" until the final reel. His smouldering sensuality panders to gay male desire, yet frustrates any possibility of identification with the object of desire.The only moment of truth, the ""one true thing"" in this film, is a speech by Susan Sarandon about the purpose of marriage. We all need ""a witness to our lives"", she says.It's too bad that ""Shall We Dance?"" fails to witness the lives of gay men who are obliged to pass for straight, and straight men who are unfairly branded as gay.This film should have been called ""Silly Dunce"". That title would bear witness to the witlessness of the writer who spawned this awful film.",,Anonymous,Music
What other demographic can we pander to?,"The film-makers have tossed a bone to about every audience sliver they can think of, they just left out any real sense of the existential angst Richard Gere's character is supposed to be going through.

But thank goodness she's ""on the shelf"". The whole redemption through dance, and it's apparent social stigma never plays true. It's not REALLY the super hot dance instructor he wants, it's DANCE!! It might have worked for a Bill Macy, but Richard's a little stretched on making this one believable. The height of this silliness culminates in the parking garage scene where Gere is outed, but which made absolutely no sense to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Relatively decent remake of the original,"I really had my doubts when I decided to watch this. I had seen the original ""Shall We Dansu"", which made more sense in the context in Japanese culture, while presenting itself as a breath of fresh air to the stale climate of the films I have recently been seeing. After watching this version, I can say that the film was relatively straight-forward copy of the original, and the performances were pretty good. Richard Gere does a good job reprising the role of the straight-laced businessman who decides to dance, and the supporting cast (including the always reliable Stanley Tucci) hold the movie well. Jennifer Lopez, surprisingly, has a relatively small role in the film, and while she doesn't butcher the role, she doesn't hold the charm the original actress did. If you can't get ahold of the original, this version will suffice. I think I might have given it a higher rating were it not for a) I did see the original, which puts me at a natural bias, b) a few scenes were too far extended, and c) if they had a more charming actress other than J.Lo in the role of Paulina.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

An old-fashioned movie for today,"SPOILERS!I will be the first to say that I wasn't holding out much hope for this movie. I mean it has J-Lo in it, for heaven's sake! And Richard Gere dancing? You gotta be kidding me! I thought Susan Sarandon must be crazy getting mixed up with a movie like this!I was wrong, on all accounts!It's the story of a man who is searching for his identity (Gere) and finds it in ballroom dancing and the lives he touches along the way. His inspiration is the lovely, but aloof Paulina (J-Lo). One of the things I liked most about this film, is they didn't go the traditional cheating husband route.OK...that's simplified a bit, but you get the idea.J-Lo proved to me that she is not only a good actress, but a wonderful dancer too. I was tired just watching some of the routines!I had heard that Richard Gere could dance, but never seen any proof of it (the tap dancing he did in Chicago is MUCH different from ballroom dancing!)Susan Sarandon, as always, was superb!Stanley Tucci was touching and impressive as Link Peterson, a straight man with a passion for dancing. Lisa Ann Walter steals many of the scenes she's in. Not only can she dance, but she has wonderful comedic timing.That's not to say that there weren't some wholes in the plot. OK, one major one. I have taken ballroom dance classes. You don't get to the level the newbie dancers got to in just 8 weeks! Maybe one of them could POSSIBLY be a quick study, but not all of them!Bottom line....This movie brings us back to the old-time Fred Astair/Ginger Rogers movies (the movie even gives a a brief no to them !)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
pointless,"This movie had only one good scene and that was when Richard Gere goes to see his wife with a rose;otherwise, there was nothing worthwhile. J-Lo didn't seem to have much screen time, mainly because her character basically does nothing. All she does is watch dance lessons and cheer on the dancers at the end. Richard Gere dances more in this than her. Her character should have just been deleted.And I didn't get why Gere was ashamed to tell his wife about dancing lessons. It's not a big deal. That's why the movie isn't much good because the topic is boring. There just isn't much drama about dancing lessons.Plus the little cutesy jokes fell flat.

Gladly, I can say that it was worth the price of admission. Jennifer Lopez was glowing and striking as Paulina, a sad and broken dancer who hides out, teaching dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's, a failing ballroom dancing school. Paulina catches the eye of John Clark (Richard Gere), a man caught in a mundane but successful lifestyle as a successful accountant with a loving wife and children.What sets ""Shall We Dance?"" apart from the majority of films, today, is its lack of cynicism and its warm sense of humor. This is a throwback to another era of movie making where romance and integrity prevail. It was great to see Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez dance together. Jennifer definitely displayed her years of dance training, here, and it was a great vehicle for her many talents as both actress and dancer. I was so happy to see a film where a man doesn't have to engage in an extramarital affair or run away from his responsibilities to open his eyes to a new way of life filled with dance and self expression.Take someone you love to this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
MUCH too predictable,"For every movie there is always some people saying that it's a really GREAT movie, and some saying the opposite. Even professional film critics does not always agree, but most of the times they do. No one can get away from being subjective, there is no such thing as being 100% objective. We all have experiences in life that effects how we see things, so much for being ""objective"". That goes for film critics too. But the difference between common people's point of view and the professional film critic's is huge... A film critic probably has an education when it comes to movies, has seen more movies and a lot more different kinds of movies than the common people. Having seen a lot of movies, different kinds of movies, from a lot of different countries makes it easier to compare, movies, acting, directing, stories and so on. To write about movies isn't any different from writing about any other form of artistic expressions, like music, books, art and so on. But to be honest about it, some film critics ARE snobbish, they could never dream about giving certain kind of movies a high ranking, no matter how good. I guess there are some good movies in any genre. The best way of avoiding seeing movies you will hate is to find some film critics that likes the same movies as you do, then use him/her as a guiding light... There's no guarantee that you ALWAYS will agree, but I'm sure that you most of the time will not be disappointed.You disagree about film critics? Well, who would you trust the most, someone who has seen all kinds of movies from different countries, or someone who never seen anything except horror movies? Most ordinary people like of certain kind of movies more than others, can be comedies, horror movies, action movies, dramas, romantic movies or whatever. They will always think highly of their favorite kind of movies, because they almost always get what they want, seeing only a certain kind of movies. If they, by accident, end up seeing something else, they will probably get very disappointed.Your experiences in life is important. Have you never had any deeper thoughts, never had any problems in your life, never ever questioned what life is all about, you would probably not like any of Bergmans movies, nor movies by the great french and Italian movie makers from the 60's. If you think life is without complications, like fairy tales, always with happy endings, you will probably only like movies that confirm that opinion about life.Now, this movie ""Shall we dance""... Have not seen the Japanese original, so to compare is impossible for me. I really didn't plan to see this American version of ""Shall we dance"". The story doesn't sound too exiting, the actors doesn't turn me on. Susan Sarandon is OK though. Saw it on Star Movies, it was for free, but most of all, there was absolutely nothing else to see, I like movies and I am always willing to give ANY movie a chance.Shall we dance is a very sweet story, TOO sweet. Hard to believe the story, an American ashamed of taking dancing lessons? Ashamed of liking to dance? WHY? Can't believe it. In the western culture dancing is normal. Until the end the movie is ""so and so"", if you like this kind of movie, I do NOT. Then in the end the movie gets really sentimental, BUT IT'S TOO MUCH, it gets silly, really stupid.So don't waste time and money on this one, there are so many nice movies to see, this one is NOT one of them.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Gere's Movie,"I admit that I pre-judged the movie but I could not help it when I saw Richard Gere's usual tired-but-I-know-it-all smile on the movie poster. And I thought to myself. Oh no, this was going to be another of his 'Intersection', 'Autumn in New York' and 'Unfaithful' types of movies. The movie turns out the be reasonably good. The story line is down to earth but I especially like it because he does not cross over (I use this term deliberately as I do not want to spoil the movie for readers). Usually the man or woman crosses over but there are no cross overs for Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. The relationship borders between intensity of a male and female and yet at times they seem so detached and distant. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. This is not one of the best of Jennifer Lopez's films because her character is not allowed to develop. Richard Gere is Richard Gere - minimal dialogue but when he does speak, the words jump out and hit reality right smack in the middle of the head. All in all, an ordinary movie. Nothing spectacular about it but good to just watch with your loved one and enjoy it as such, just an ordinary movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Unintentionally funny.,"I know this film is from 2004, but it just happens that I have just seen it on TV. And it really made an impact on me, because first I thought it was extremely boring and I changed the channel several times, but there was nothing else worth seeing, I mean the alternative would've been the news! God help me, not on this time! So I had to continue watching the film and suddenly I thought it was very funny even though the film is not supposed to be funny, more like a light comedy. Some scenes were so ridiculous that I saw myself laughing both of the scene and the characters and the story. It's; you know like the middle aged professional lawyer that has an extremely boring family and job, he doesn't care for his wife but suddenly he sees a beautiful dance instructor through the train window which motivates him to change all his way of life. He just didn't know that he was a dancing talent like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly! And this fabulous woman makes him see it just by swinging a little in the floor, and pang! he can dance Argentinian tango, American fox trot, waltz from Vienna, you name it; it was a miracle I was astonished. But I must admit it was a little frustrating that there is no real conclusion, I mean, like, there was this dancing contest that everybody was so interested in.. and we never see the ending of it so we will never know who won the contest! Oh; I know, they are surely filming a ""Shall We Dance II"" where we will know who won! So if you are bored go and look at it. Its surely worth the trouble to have your eyes open.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
See the originals Japanese movie,"Hollywood bereft of ideas remakes, or more to the point, rips off the fabulous Japanese movie released internationally in the same name. The original is outrageously funny where an uptight businessman realizes something is missing in his life and surreptitiously takes evening ballroom dancing lessons. While the taboo extracurricular activity creates the tension in the Japanese setting, the conceit of Richard Gere as an overworked businessman looking for a release utterly falls flat.Even if one had no knowledge of the Japanese original I wouldn't recommend this movie.

"Thinly veiled remake of William Shakespeare's ""To Dance or Not to Dance, That is The Question.""","Movie begins awkwardly, takes a while to find its rhythm, and then just as its movement begins to becomes captivating, it suddenly spins off and falls on its ballroom butt. Gere tries to come to the rescue during the fatal twirl and explains to us (by way of his shrew wife) why after an hour of learning the right moves he's suddenly stepping on the toes of the collective movie audience. Something about loving said wife too much (cue the tear) to ever want her to know that he wasn't satisfied with his perfectly boring life. I personally became mad hot with that explanation for leading a pretty decent movie into the dance hall dumper. Not to be a total naysayer, understated Jennifer Lopez is pretty good in this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
OK as fluff,"Shall We Dance? (2004) Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Anita Gillette, D: Peter Chelsom. Overworked middle-aged attorney Gere finds a change of pace by taking up ballroom dancing after he's intrigued by the lovely, loney-looking instructor (Lopez), whom he spots staring out the window of a downtown dance studio. Beginning to take dance lessons, he finally discovers the one passion that gives him release and happiness, unbeknownst to wife Sarandon and his family. The extraneous characters are done in broad-brush strokes, including a one-note Lopez, but are colorful and likable. Pleasant-enough fluff may be clumsy compared to its source, the Japanese film of the same name, but the dance numbers are alive, and it's a nice surprise that the romance is between the married Gere and Sarandon, not Gere and Lopez. 98 min., rated PG-13. ** ½",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Yet another Hollywood remake,"I think it's sad to see that Hollywood yet again finds it necessary to remake ""old"" and foreign films in order to enjoy the creativity of others. This has so far not been but a mere attempt to feed of the greatness of others. This remake of the Japanese movie is no exception. I have no doubt that they somehow really tried to recreate the restrictive Japanese mood, but this is not really possible unless you're in Japan and surrounded by Japs. Then again a ""new"" film and new characters. In order to do the original justice they could have casted some actors whose skills would exceed the mediocre. In conclusion a movie for the American who is afraid to be perceived as an intellectual, which would be the case should he choose to see the original with SUBTITLES. I can only say that this a movie that I preferred not to have seen, but then again: ain't life a bitch...SHALL WE DANSU? [1996]",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Cute, Enjoyable, but Badly Cast and Too Predictable","As chick flicks go, ""Shall We Dance"" was less painful than most. It had a likable supporting cast and it gave me a few laughs, so I didn't mind enduring this film for my wife's sake. But it COULD have been a lot better, and the problem starts with Richard Gere. No, I'm not saying Gere gives a bad performance- he's perfectly okay. The problem is, the male in this film's lead role should be an ordinary Joe with an ordinary white-collar job, and a humdrum life. Why else would he find ballroom dancing an appealing escape from his otherwise dull life? But even though Gere gives a decent performance, we just can't forget for a second that he's NOT an ordinary Joe! He's Richard Freaking Gere, a handsome, rich, suave movie star who looks great in a tux! That makes it hard to buy the central premise, that his character needs an escape from reality.I don't wish to insult Mr. Gere for being good-looking! But in this case, I think the part called for an actor who wasn't so glamorous. Of course, while that might have made for a better movie, the theaters wouldn't be as packed with women as they were last Saturday!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Stop comparing apples and oranges.,"I don't know how many times I've read reviews of this movie that slammed it because ""the Japanese version is better."" No, it isn't. The Japanese version ""different"" and different is good. Okay, the Japanese version deals with the social stigmatism of showing off in public and ballroom dancing is one target of their uptightness. That's a great angle to tell a story from.In the U.S., obviously, we don't have that kind of social convention. We have a totally different outlook on such things, but they can run quite parallel to the Japanese way of life. In the American version, John Clark has pretty much everything he could ask for. A beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home and much more. And he is bored out of his skull and has no idea why. When he finds that he loves ballroom dancing and then is found out by his wife, he doesn't have to deal with the social implications of public displays as in the Japanese version, but the embarrassment and heartache of having to admit that his ""perfect life"" was missing something.Though our society doesn't condemn you for wanting to dance, or more specifically, ballroom dance, you will find out how many morons there are around you that will assume that if you are a guy and you love to dance, you must be gay. Link Peterson was absolutely correct in keeping his passion secret for as long as he did and he was dead right on about the reaction that would occur if the people in the office found out about it.So I give this film ten stars just because, as a dance movie, it has great dancing. As a romance, it shows what can happen when secrets are kept and how much better off our relationships would be if we didn't try so hard to hide them. Get this movie and enjoy a good story and quit worrying so much about how Japanese society is ""this"" and Japanese society is ""that.""",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Ho Hum,"I was not impressed but by the grace of Gere's performance although inconsistent. Susan did not do that well here, anybody could have played her, as well as Lopez. Yes, she's a dancer, but I still can't swallow her acting.The soundtrack was OK...I was hoping for more ummph with that...like more Latin favorites. The script seemed canned at times.The gal that plays the danceoholic is funny but mediocre at best. Stanley Tucci as always delivers but succumbs to the whims of the writer who instead of raising Tucci's character, lowers him to the typical misunderstood heterosexual with talent.Not much resuscitates this movie from the dead. Let's hope that this trend is buried for a little while at least.By the way, dance training in jazz, does not a ballroom dancer make.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Corny,"I expected J. Lo to be bad as usual, but I never expected her to be this bad. So she was suppose to have had her heart broken, but who on earth goes to work everyday like that. She put it on way to thick, that it was beyond annoying. Richard Gere on the other hand I expected more from. It is like as if her bad acting rubbed off on him or something. Their scenes together were real eye rollers, mind you the script for those scenes was pretty bad too. I was very happy with Susan Sarandon however. She helped make the movie more bearable. But Stanley Tucci was by far the saviour here. He was fabulous. funny, and lovable. He is a very talented man. I hoped for a bit more action on the dance floor, but what you do get is pretty good. Except for the ball room dance between Lopez and the other instructor, where they are trying to give a foretaste of better things to come for Gere's character and the other dance students. Her lip hung lower then her skirt. So over-dramatic. Bottom line if you go in expecting the worst ever performance from Gere and Lopez, your expectations will be reached.

More for the music and dance - than the acting.,"This is the kind of movie that you rent to while the time away with. In Old Hollywood terminology, it's a B-movie. It's meant for simple entertainment only. For what it's meant to be, it delivers. If you want more out of the story, rent the original Japanese film it is based on.If you like music and dance, you will enjoy this movie. I have only one gripe with how it is available within IMDb ... namely, as a movie about music and dance -- and how it affects and identifies the characters and story -- it weaves a volume of songs and dance tunes into the emotions -- yet IMDb has failed to list the songs and dance tunes of the soundtrack that are integral to the story.That scene where Jennifer Lopez dances a modern tango with Richard Gere ...... what IS that song/tango they danced to?

Thoughtful and engaging.  So many people are closet dancers,"This movie has many great textures - the opposite sex attraction, the dancing, the dynamics and stresses of relationships, and then on a deeper level, the thoughtful narration of Gere's character concerning people and their wills, their lives, and their hopes and regrets. I was impressed by the acting of all the main characters, and was especially surprised by Lopez's performance. This movie is so much a story about the dreams and hidden desires of most people, who deep inside want to break out of their mundane routines, and do something that's in their heart. Personally I related incredibly to Gere's character -- sure, deep inside I would love to dance, to express myself, to become skilled at something I did on the dance floor in the 80's...but am afraid of what people would think of a 46 yr old father of six doing something like that. The music was outstanding and added a very specific flavor to the film, invoking a mood of thoughtfulness and self examination at the right time, and the spice of exuberance when appropriate.

A subtle commentary on cultural taboos,"In Masayuki Suo's Shall We Dance? a suppressed middle-aged accountant on his way home from work spots a beautiful woman gazing pensively out of the window of an upper level dance studio. Determined to get to know her, he gets off the train and enrolls in dancing lessons at the studio but, because of the taboos in Japanese culture against physical touching in public, does not tell his wife. Learning basic waltz, rumba, and mambo steps under the tutelage of the graceful teacher Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari), he gradually releases some of his repressed energy and begins to re-experience the joy of being alive. He practices his steps in the street, at the beach, and underneath his desk at work. Things become a bit complicated, however, when his wife notices a positive change in his attitude and hires a private detective to see if he is having an affair.Koji Yakusyo strikes just the right note as the repressed accountant, conveying a man who has closed down but has a hidden reserve of vitality just underneath the surface. He is ably supported by fellow dance students: Mr. Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), a co-worker who wears a black wig and imitates a famous Latin dancer, and Toyoko (Eriko Watanabe), a brassy Bette Midler type who constantly changes partners and berates those who do not meet her standards. She admires Sugiyama, however, and is a big factor in changing his outlook when he wants to quit. Mai, the dance instructor, it turns out, is a world-class dancer who was cut off by her father after an accident in a competition in Blackpool, England and is now teaching part time at the studio but dreams of returning to competition.In an emotional scene, she confronts Sugiyama as someone more interested in her affections than in the art of dancing. Later, however, she helps him overcome his fears and both gain the courage to follow their dreams. While Shall We Dance? is essentially a comedy, it is also a subtle commentary on cultural taboos and the restrictive nature of Japanese society. Though the film is subdued and without a big emotional payoff, Suo's strong direction allows us to identify with the characters and glimpse the possibilities in our own life that are open if we are willing to take a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A surprisingly good movie...,"I have just finished watching ""Shall We Dance"", the remake of the Japanese movie with the same name.I was expecting an entertaining movie and it was exactly what I got. ""Shall We Dance"" is definitely a lift of fresh air. I was delightedly surprised.Richard Gere is an overworked lawyer who discovers that dance lessons is what he needed to fulfill his life with happiness and joy.I know that the plot might sound pretty lame and it does. On paper it does sound pretty cliché and pretty lame. Why would anyone want to watch this? The question - the actors.The cast is what raises the bar in this movie. It isn't just a sweet comedy with bland, underdeveloped and uneven performances like all the other sweet comedies. The actors in their roles completely shine.Richard Gere brought for the first time in years the charm and charisma that he once had. He is perfect as the main lead and I really think he will have a shot in making my Best Actor ballot at the end of the year. I really expect him to be nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Actor Comedy/ Musical. It's just the type of performance that they love to recognize.Susan Sarandon can do no wrong. And once again she showed that she is really one of the best actresses working today. She doesn't have big scenes or strong moments. But she is absolutely great during the whole movie. I really loved her.And now Jennifer Lopez. As many of you know I don't hate her like everybody does but I also don't like her. I found her a talented actress (she already proved that in Out of Sight) with some terrible bad choices in movies and of course in personal life. At the beginning her character seemed kind of bland and uninteresting as did she. However as the movie keeps going Jennifer Lopez turns out to give an extremely and surprisingly sweet performance. And wow she really can dance. I think that people will be warm to her again after seeing this movie.All the supporting cast is hilarious. I loved Stanley Tucci in this and I don't think he was overexposed. One of his best performances to date. And I absolutely loved Lisa Ann Walter - the funniest performance (Quit looking to my ass!!! ).Another thing that surprised me in this movie is the strong chemistry that Richard Gere has with both leading ladies - Lopez and Sarandon. It's really unbelievable.All the dance scenes are great, especially one in the middle between Gere and Lopez.One of the few things that I really didn't like was the Score. It was a bit annoying.I really think this movie will do great in the box-office. Of course it won't be a critical success but it is definitely a crowd pleaser and it will have a good word of mouth.""Shall We Dance"" is one of those movies that can't do no harm. It's extremely inoffensive and also sweet and cute. Of course it isn't a masterpiece. Far from it.

relearn to be happy,"The cast of this film is excellent. The performance of John and Paulina are vivid. I love to watch their dancing which is of much grace and passion, and helps to make this film rive above the average level of this kind. So I think most of the cast have made great endeavor in learning how to dance in order to make this movie.The scenery is also good and natural. And I don't think this is a kind of story that relies on grand pictures or winding plots. What this film makes is to naturally show the audience the lives of a common middle-aged man and a dancer. Here I do think the director is perfectly smart. This story wins my praise merely upon its natural expression of emotion and moving playing.When a man find it difficult to share his life with his family, to give his wife, children a big embrace, to seek joy from his everyday life, just as he did before, shall we dance can probably enlighten him.

Marital issues on Shall we Dance,"What i've seen in Shall we Dance are marital issues. First, they work on different hours. Gere works on daytime and Sarandon works at nighttime; and they practically get used to it. I mean, they come and go without even kissing and i don't think that's a healthy sign for married couples who barely see each other. Second, Gere indulged into a new career without even telling his wife anything about it. So technically, they do not really have open communication with each other; which caused Susan to think her husband is into another relationship. Third, Susan didn't interrogate Gere on her thoughts about his 'extra-activities' but switched into detectives and snooped on her husband. But the good thing about her is that she respects her husband's 'private life' which i think is really amazing about her. I mean, do married couples need to have private lives of their own? Third, it's kind of really uncomfortable to see your husband dancing with a younger, sexier, and more beautiful woman; although Lopez's character is strong and very professional. But then the issues were resolved at then end and i think that's that. There were just questions hanging on my thoughts: what if Lopez swooned over Gere (because she did not) in the movie? Would Gere still revive his marital relationship with Sarandon?",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I guess the trailer drew me in. However, I'm very glad I did see it, because I enjoyed it tremendously.The supporting cast was marvelous. Lisa Ann Walters as Bobbie practically stole the show, and Stanley Lucci as Link, the closet dancer, was a surprising treat. Susan Sarandon, in the role of Richard Gere's wife, was as solid as always.Somehow the movie works. The dancing is wonderful, and the camaraderie that grows amongst the clientele of Miss Mitzi's School of Dance is heartwarming without being sickly sentimental.

A good remake of a Japanese classic,"Loved the Japanese original and was skeptical that the remake could be as good. Smartly, the remake did not try to duplicate the cultural nuances of the original but built on the sense of humor and warmth of the characters.While I am neither a Gere or Lopez fan--not that I dislike them, I think they are fine--in this movie, they were terrific. I also couldn't think of any better a supporting cast. I'm also not a dance fan, but found the dancing enjoyable to watch.I and my girlfriend laughed throughout and my girlfriend cried here and there. A good date movie and nice little feel-good movie as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
musical enchantment,"This movie was wonderful. Please, if you are reading This and have Not seen it-go! Right now. A wonderful and exhilarating movie, strongly underrated.This movie is about finding yourself through the power of dance. It is beautifully filmed, sweetly sentimental without at all being maudlin and the dance scenes are equisite. Now if one is not a fan of movies that center on dancing they may not like this but I think all should give it a chance as it will probably charm you. There is One dance sequence between Gear and Lopez that will take your breath away.The movie is an ode to the power of dancing and you do not have to be a fan of ballroom dancing to easily love this movie. I had a more enjoyable time watching this on the big screen then almost any film I've yet seen in 2004. Even JLO who I've never been particularly impressed by, was great here as the fragile dance instructor. Gear and Sarandon deliver as always but it is the quirky supporting cast I recommend you watch for. This movie is not by the numbers-you will not always be able to guess what is gonna happen. It is funny, touching, completely different from other films out there now, contains great dance sequences and virtually all it's characters are humanized in a way that will be relateable to almost everyone. I give this an 8.5 as a whole but a 10 of 10 for pure enjoyment purposes. Watching this is absolutely exhilarating and movies like this should be made more often.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A definite ""feel good"" movie!","When was the last time you were in a movie theater and the audience clapped at the end of a movie? It happened at the Sneak Preview of ""Shall We Dance?"" There is something in it for everyone....Richard Gere looks breathtaking in formal attire and Jennifer Lopez looks seductive in her dress and style of dancing.Although the movie is about the relationship between Gere and his wife, the humor is achieved with the unique personalities at the dance studio. Everyone can relate to the rookie learning a new hobby or sport. There is also the underlying theme about being able to achieve some level of success even after a short period of time. I especially enjoyed watching the ""real dancers"" at the competition in the movie. I think Lisa Ann Walter steals some of the limelight from the major actors in this film.It reminded me of old movies because I realized there was nothing that would cause this movie to be rated ""R"". Although it doesn't have the chase scenes or the fight scenes, guys might want to take their date to see this movie because it surely puts a woman in a romantic mood.On a practical note, there were a few things that didn't make sense from a dancing point of view, but I can't disclose them here or it will ruin some of the enjoyment. I wonder if there will be an increased interest in dancing after this movie is released! Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Sexy Dancing and Great Acting,"There's enough great music in this romantic comedy to call it a musical, and the dancing may have been the start of a trend that led to the arrival of ""Dancing with the Stars"" on television in 2005. Richard Gere plays a married man who becomes enchanted by a dancer, Jennifer Lopez, he sees from the window of the train he rides home from work. The dance scenes with Lopez are rife with that magic life ingredient, spice. The tango in the dark is so sexy, and the chemistry between Gere and Susan Sarandon, as his wife, would make anybody want to get married. This is a remake of a 1996 Japanese film of the same title that is well worth seeing. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny and sweet,"If it weren't for one fly in the ointment at the end of the movie, I would love Shall We Dance. As it is, I like it very much, but every time I watch it, I turn it off before the end. It stars Richard Gere as a businessman who's bored with life and feeling stale. From the window on the train ride home one night, he sees Jennifer Lopez teaching in her dance studio and feels inspired to sign up for lessons. Learning to dance gives him a new lease on life, but he's so embarrassed he doesn't tell anyone. His friend at work Stanley Tucci supports him, but the other fellows in the office would surely torment him if they knew. His wife, Susan Sarandon, gets so worried about him coming home late from the office, she hires a private detective, Richard Jenkins, to find out what he's actually doing. The entire cast is very cute, and the story is funny and sweet.I've seen the original Japanese version, and it's delightful. Because of the cultural stigmatism of showing weakness and taking dance lessons as a hobby, it makes much more sense in that setting. When Richard Gere keeps his hobby as a shameful secret, you can't help but wonder why. Why doesn't he want to tell his sexy wife so they can spice up their marriage? Why doesn't he want to brag to his colleagues about his sexy hidden talents? Let's face it: Richard Gere is just too sexy for the movie. Someone else should have been cast, someone who really would be embarrassed to take ballroom dance classes. Gene Hackman, John C. Reilly, or even Anthony Hopkins, would have been better choices (it's an ageless role). It's supposed to be out-of-character for the protagonist to take an interest in dancing, and heartwarming that he discovers a new side to himself. For the star of American Gigolo, it's neither of those things.Still, this movie is a great choice for date night or matinee day with your pals. It's uplifting, funny, charming, and light. Don't take it seriously or compare the American setting to the Japanese original. Appreciate it for what it is, and you'll have a great time. Susan Sarandon has a lovely speech about the importance of marriage, Richard Jenkins and Stanley Tucci enjoy the cutest roles of their careers, and Jennifer Lopez is everything she needs to be. Richard Gere is Richard Gere: a man any woman would be glad to have as her husband, even if he takes secret dance lessons with a very attractive younger woman.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Must see,"Lovely almost tear-jerking dance movie. Makes you wanna pick-up the old lessons again. Great dancing by the actors but consider the DVD which show a lot more lovely dance acts as Bonus material....!The music also is fabulous. Besides some modern versions of standards such as Shall we dance, there is a great piece of tango music. It accompanies the highlight dance of Gere and JayLo. The tango they dance could very well give a push to ballroom dancing as a replacement for the silly dancing one sees in the party scene. Ballroom dancing for sure will be the next hot thing here in Europe, but I guess also in the US and elsewhere. Hence the great popularity of TV-programs like BBC's Strictly come dancing where celebrities and pro's contest on the dance floor. The popular program already is widely copied by other networks here on the continent",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A lovely ""small"" film","What a nice surprise. Knew nothing about this movie, other than a positive recommendation from a few friends. This is the second American film in the last few months ( Sideways being the other ) that has the look & feel of a well made European film. That is to say, it takes an intimate look at everyday life and tells a compelling story. Richard Gere was a pleasure to watch. He plays a Mr. Peepers type of character and pulls it off nicely. Stanley Tucci should be considered for Best Supporting Actor. He is consistently a wonderful actor and his work in this film is A+. The film also has some of the best laugh out loud scenes of 2004. Tucci & Gere in the mens' room practicing their dance position and being discovered; priceless ! The bottom line: do yourself a favor and go see this film. If we support ""small"" American films at the box office, who knows, maybe they'll keep making them !",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderfully delightful movie,"This is a feel good movie that moves along at a nice pace. From start to finish, it keeps your attention. There is nothing boring about it. This movie entertains in a positive way. And, creates a desire to dance. One leaves the theatre feeling uplifted and in a good mood.More productions should be like this one. I'm always seeking good entertainment that doesn't resort to raw sex and violence. This one stands on its own with a good story. The story is believable and well shot. All of the actors do a great job and are very believable in their roles. Most importantly, it is uplifting for the soul.A must see! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Impossible to dislike,"Despite some of the negative reviews and the modest viewer rating, my view is that this is still a movie that is impossible to dislike. It's a warm, wonderful, funny, feel good fantasy, set in an almost ""never never land."" (Winnipeg never looked so good!) The casting in perfect. Susan Sarandon is ideal. So is Gere. All the others are made for their parts. Much of the film's charm is the soft pastel hue of the colour and the delicate, sometimes diaphanous lighting. It's also very sexy without being overly erotic. Jennifer Lopez has a great body but it is a dancer's body more than that of an ingenue. I thought Lisa Ann Walter was fabulous although she works too hard at being a Bette Midler clone. But that's okay. I like Bette Midler too. I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews of the professional ""literati."" But I suppose these days a movie is regarded as hopelessly ineffective if it does not brim with groping, gunfights and in your face grossness. Surprisingly, in a script refreshingly free of profanity, the ""F-word"" makes one appearance. It was totally needless and its presence surprised me. This is a charming, creative movie. Sure, it's not hard to guess how it will end. But getting there is a delightful way of spending an evening!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Great fun,"This movie, ""Shall We Dance?"" is a delightful comedy. Richard Gere is excellent. The characters at the dance studio are such fun. His two fellow members of the beginners class are good. I remember Anita Gillete, the actress who plays the the dance studio owner, from the movie ""Moonstruck"". She has a much better part here and is very good in it. Jennifer Lopez mostly stands around and poses. Susan Sarandon has a really minor role. Lisa Ann Walter is effective in her part.This movie will probably be a great box office success, strickly from word of mouth. It is a light comedy and it is a time when Americans need some lightness and laughter in their lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good movie, but not as good as the original.","There are major differences in all of the characterizations between this American remake and the original Japanese production. These differences when compared to the original make for a less interesting film. In the original, you feel and understand the angst that each of the characters are going through with ballroom dancing as the tread that binds them together. The American version, in my opinion, seems to reverse the scenario presenting dancing as the main theme with the other characters acting around it but not really interacting with each other.It was for me, nevertheless, a fun movie. The tango music which is danced by Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and composed/played by the Argentine Group, The Gotan Project, is phenomenal! Enjoy",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than expected!,"We chose to see this film out of desperation of nothing else to watch and were very pleasantly surprised. It was much better than lots of film reviews had lead me to believe. It is silly, fun and romantic. Thank god the end wasn't predictable from the start. J Lo proves that she really can dance. it's none of that rubbish you see on Top of the Pops, but actual dance. I defy you to leave the cinema and not think about dancing in some way. Richard Gere has also lost none of his tap dancing skills learnt earlier in life. Some highly entertaining sections were dotted throughout the film. The casting was superb. My favourite being the dance instructor and Bobby!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Subtle Messages.,"I saw this movie with a friend and liked it so much I went back to see it only two weeks later with my husband who said that HE would like to see it again too!Lots of subtle messages came across in this movie. Like how important it is to step into an adventurous zone once in a while. Like how important it is to make time for primary relationships. Like how important it is to be yourself and not care so much what people think of you; as my husband says, people will gossip about you anyway: Give them something worthwhile to talk about!And then, of course, there was the tension between attraction and love and loyalty: one can't help wondering what would have happened if Paulina HAD accepted John Clark's dinner invitation. It was nice to see the unexpected ending - older woman keeping her husband AND learning to loosen up and have fun in the process.And of course, there was Richard Gere (for me to sigh over) and Susan Sarandon and Lisa Walter (for my husband, who likes older AND plump and forthright women!) - who just seem to be getting sexier with age!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
old-fashioned warmth so missing lately,"Yes, indeed, this movie didn't display much eroticism. It wasn't meant to be erotic. Yes, agreed, this movie doesn't cover any new ground or new techniques. It was quite appropriate to work with things that have been tried in the past - in different ways - once again, and yes, by all means, things worked out in the end the way they so seldom do in films of our time, much to my surprise. It was a happy ending to (basically) a happy movie and there's nothing whatsoever in the world wrong with that. Even more, it's handled well on all levels - acting, script, music, dancing, color, camera movement...It's a film that fulfilled a need that many of us feel when the world doesn't go where we want it to go.

Indirectly he gives courage for a dance teacher to go back to dance lessons and dance competitions, that is also something wonderful.

A man's search for more than the ordinary in life,"Thoreau wrote that most men live out their lives in quiet desperation. A desperation of finding you are doing the same thing over and over again and the years are going by as you do it.

The characters are believable, poignant, and often funny.There is a marvelous song, ""I Hope You Dance"" that I give to important young women in my life but had to be reminded that the poor working stiff needs to keep dancing too...just for the joy...just for the human contact and closeness...and that if you are just learning where to put your hands and feet...you aren't dancing.For all the metaphor regarding dancing, it is about life and relationships, and being true to yourself....and does a good job of it....and after seeing it...you just may want to learn to dance.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I HIGHLY recommend this movie!,"I just got back from viewing a special sneak preview of this film held at one of our local theaters. Let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning all the way to the end.It is a wonderful combination of comedy, romance and heartwarming events that center around a middle-aged man's discovery of dancing and how it awakens him from his state of mediocrity.Realizing that his life is rather boring, doing the same things every day, John Clark wanders into a dancing school one night and signs up for lessons, much to his own shock and chagrin. As he begins taking classes, he realizes that he loves it.Feeling self conscious and embarrassed about it, he hides it from everyone he knows - including his wife and daughter. The dancing gave him something new, something enjoyable that he had no idea he had in him.Through the course of his lessons, he develops lasting friendships with his classmates and instructors, while at the same time reawakening his romance with his wife.This movie is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. I highly recommend it as a heartwarming story with stunning performances by Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez. Two thumbs up, for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good dancing, from a dancing fan.","I like all song and dance movies, dance movies, song movies. Makes no difference. IMO we need more of them. As a tap dancer, I enjoyed Gere's footwork in ""Chicago"", and wished there had been more of it. In ""Shall We Dance"", early on I thought John was trying to surprise his wife with learning how to dance since so many men have clumsy left feet while their wives are usually much better dancers. I liked all the actors in their parts. Tucci was hilarious. Sarandon was veteran, capable and qualified. John's daughter finally came around and admitted Dad was okay, when she saw him in that tux dancing in the competition near the end. Wow, Dad has grace now. Even in this day of hip-hop, Dad isn't so bad after all. John's fellow male dance students were very sweet, and I liked the part at the end where Vern finally has his wedding and dances with his bride, and the 3rd guy is even able to dance at a gay bar -- to boogie down with the best of them. Perhaps he will win a dance contest there, too. A very sweet movie. Very happy to see Anita Gillette (great first name). 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Bring your significant other - what a great couple movie.,"Richard Geer is an estate lawyer - plodding through life like the rest of us - seemingly having everything - but has an emptiness in his life.Wishing to become 'more happy' he seeks diversion by taking ballroom dancing lessons. This film is a very touching look at how our lives can be so caught up in the drudgery of day-to-day routines that we can overlook how simple changes can make a difference.When his wife finds out about his extra-curricular activities she's quite upset. This is where we find that pride and shame, the reason for hiding what he was doing, can be such an obstacle in any relationship.Overall, an excellent movie, in which the ending scene brought a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye.

Rekindling the fire in a marriage,"Shall we dance is one of the most romantic movies I have seen in recent times. The movie stars Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez.The movie opens with a narration from John Clark (Richard Gere), a busy attorney in the ""Big Apple"". He is content with his life. He is happily married to Beverly Clark (Susan Sarandon), a fashion designer, for 19 years. The couple is blessed with two kids who are in their teens. John Clark is so content and happy with his life that on his birthday when his wife asks him to name something that he wants that ""comes in a box"" - He says that he is so happy that he cannot think of anything else! The uneventful and content life of this busy attorney takes a turn when by accident he chances upon seeing a beautiful woman with an expression less face (Jennifer Lopez who plays Paulina) from the window of a train and enrolls himself in a dance school hoping to meet her! There he meets two other people - an overweight colored man, who is looking to master a few moves to impress his girl friend before he actually proposes to her and a gay man. There John Clark finds that his teacher is Miss Mitzy and not Paulina! At first John is clumsy and so are his batch mates. When he tries to break into a conversation with Paulina - she cuts him off saying that he should be more serious about dancing and if he has enrolled there looking for a date, he has come to the wrong place. This icy comment makes John only more determined about learning how to dance and he along with other members enroll for a dance competition. Paulina and Miss Mitzy train them to dance. John starts spending more time on the dance floor. Beverly grows suspicious. She employs a private detective to know what John is up-to. What the detective finds out baffles her wildest imagination. Finally on the D-day John sets his foot on the dance floor for the competition and Beverly and his teenage daughter are there to watch him. On seeing them John loses his balance and he loses the competition. In the final moments Paulina gets her groove back and wants to leave for London to continue her career. She asks for one final audience with John - ""Shall we dance Mr. Clark?"". Whether he accepts her invite or not forms the rest of the story. At the end Beverly discovers ""something"" that her husband wants ""that comes in a box"". The flame in the relationship between Beverly and John rekindles. The movie is romantic and the way it unfolds on the screen is simply superb. There are certain cracker of a dialogs like ""Why do people marry? - Your life will not go unnoticed - Because I will notice. Your life will not be unwitnessed - I will be the witness to your life. We marry because we need a witness to our lives"" There is one more from John saying ""You gave me so much - that I felt guilty to tell you that I wanted to find happiness elsewhere - that I enrolled myself in a dancing class"" Richard Gere is perfect, Susan Sarandon looks great and Jennifer Lopez gives a controlled performance in this romantic comedy of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dance the night away,A first class movie for the whole family to go & see. The light hearted script & fine acting performances from the entire cast made this a joy to behold. As a ballroom dancer of nearly 50 years standing I was able to fully appreciate the hard work Richard Gere went through for his part of John Clark. Susan Sarandon gave her customary high class performance. The music was expertly woven into the sound track. Congratulations to all concerned in the making of this film. In nearly 6 decades of film viewing this is one of only a handful that I would see for a second time.

But I like dance movies. And this was a very good one. It seems to me that there is a tendency to dig way to deep into the hidden meanings of films. I do it and so do you! But I think it is perfectly aok to take this movie on it's face value as a feel-good romantic comedy with a good cast, good and quirky performances, good dancing, a happy ending, considering all of it's qualities, and give it the praise it deserves. It works. Richard Gere is charming and effective. Several of the scenes as he sat in the L train were very effective. Jlo was very good. I thought Susan Serandon was absolutely terrific and I am not a big fan of her. For instance, I thought the most sensual scene was when she and Gere were in the kitchen at the end and they were ""dancing"", so to speak. They projected a great sense of romantic love. Another great scene was when Stanley Tucci came out of his office, sharply twirled the secretary up, around, back and down in her chair as an exclamation point of his passion for dancing.Good movie.

It's just one of those movies that makes you come away from it with a lighter step, a smile on your face and a song on your lips. The characters are believable as is the plot, and what do you know? - the principal couple stays married and their relationship improves - no affairs or splits. That's not something you see too often in movies these days.I also thought the music choices were very good. The Pussycat Dolls ""Sway With Me"" was a great upbeat version of Dean Martin's original. The use of other movie music - ""Shall We Dance"" and ""Moon River"" and the modern Latin styles were a good mix of the old and new. The dance scenes were well choreographed and those actors sure put a great deal of work into carrying them out in a believable style.Call me old fashioned but I do like a good romantic comedy and Richard Gere is a real sweetie! a real Sweetie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Perfect Movie!,"Wow! We saw the sneak preview and it was simply spectacular. Richard Gere is simply wonderful as a dancer in this terrific role. He shines throughout the movie as does the one and only J Lo. SHe is gorgeous, sexy a fantastic body and wonderful dancer. And not a single kiss in the entire movie with Gere. The other members of this cast will have you rolling in the aisles. Stanley TUcci shows more of his versatility and is equally wonderful as is Gere in the movie as a closet dancing lawyer. Bobby Cannavale who is beginning to show up everywhere on the small screen in roles as tough guys is a fabulous dancer and comedian in this movie. The very huge Omar Benson Miller who you have seen time and again in a stereotypical ""Black man"" role is wonderful and a dancer, comic and just wonderful in this quite a jump from his usual roles where is has been a fine fine serious actor. We loved it and recommend it highly. We hope that it catches the attention of the Academy as it is so refreshing and different that it deserves nominations for any and all of the folks in the movie and I am sure it will garner many golden globe awards because it is a ""musical"" love story of sorts... the love of dancing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I saw the original Japanese version of Shall We Dance a few months ago and loved it, so I didn't think the American version would live up to its standards as remakes tend to lose the charm of the original. This movie has shown me that it's possible. Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez are wonderfully cast in their roles, but the two who are worth mentioning most are supporting players Stanley Tucci (Link) and Lisa Ann Walter (Bobbie.) As far as behavior is concerned, Ms. Walter is a spitting image of her Japanese counterpart and grasps the perfect note for her character, she must've seen the original film and if not, that makes it even more amazing.

A general praise of a feel-very-good piece of entertainment art.,"A professional ballroom dancer would like this film because it does promise to encourage greater participation in dance. A learner ballroom dancer would love it because it does show a progression from hopeful tyro to competent social and even display dancing in its characters.Romantics would love this film because it does require a suitable degree of suspension of reality for everything to work together. After doing so it offers a blessed sense of warmth and well-being that is generated by a complete fulfilment of wishes for the characters. It seems only sad then that there was not twice as much film to see.Popular music lovers would like this film for its original works by such as Peter Gabriel. The songs of Dean Martin and the tracks of The Gotan Project are welcome. They produce apt and realistic dance themes as well as the atmospherics that permit viewers to recall the film for a long time afterwards.Film buffs, aspiring scriptwriters and directors might think this film virtuous if they can enter into an empathy with the viewers in order to allow them to cede supremacy of valuation to them, the real consumers.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Excellent dancing comedy,"SHALL WE DANCE, in my opinion, is an excellent dancing comedy. John (Richard Gere) and Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) looked really good when they were dancing. I really couldn't stand Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter) for the most part. This was because she was really b*****! She was also frequently saying, ""Stop looking at my a**!"" That truly turned me off. When the flashback was shown, I wanted to cry. If you want to know the reason, you'll have to see the movie. The competition and lessons were the best things about this film. When Beverly (Susan Sarandon) and John danced together, I felt truly touched. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent dancing comedy to all you Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, or Susan Sarandon fans who have not seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Before it's too late....,"Is it still in your theaters? Go see it before it disappears!I just had a private screening - i.e. I was the only one in the $1.50 theater for the 9:50pm showing, and had to shame the projectionist into showing it because it was, after all, advertised on line and in the papers. What a wonderful film.I thought, what, a Richard Gere middle-aged man movie about ballroom dancing? Gimme a break. But I've been seeing some bum movies lately (Bill Murray, snap out of it!), and my daughter e-mailed me and told me not to miss this one. I trusted her and went, and as always she deserved my trust.This is just a marvelous movie. Exquisitely and sensitively written, funny and I mean laugh-out-loud-in-an-empty-theater funny,and absolutely filled with memorable characters. If Stanley Tucci weren't already such a big star, this would have been his star-making role. Wow!And for Omar Benson Miller it is indeed his star turn. If you go see it just for Tucci and Miller it'll be worth your money.But go see it for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"Don't listen to the naysayers! This movie was awesome from beginning to end.Not having seen the Japanese version, I didn't come in with any preconceptions.Also, not being a huge Richard Gere fan, I wasn't that enthused.But this movie was a delight. I can't remember having so much fun.All the characters were funny and I laughed so hard I almost cried at some of the funny moments in the movie.And Richards scenes with Susan were touching and romantic.I loved, loved, loved this movie and recommend it highly...",,Anonymous,Music
Shall We Dance? - No,"Last night at the Bijou I wasn't bored, but I was disappointed. Richard Gere as in ""Chicago"" once again has good editing and schtick to sneak by as a dancer. Frank Sinatra in his narration of ""That's Entertainment"" said of Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Charise, ""you can hope and pray but you won't see the likes of them again"". Films like this prove it. Dance sequences are edited 80% with close up and waist up shots. The few full body shots (where you actually see feet dancing) are cleverly edited in no more than a couple of dance steps lasting a couple of seconds. I imagine they worked long and hard with many takes getting some decent head to toe footage. Jennifer Lopez, who I understand was trained as a dancer, is at best 2nd rate. Gere cannot be rated, he's not a dancer. You do get to see some great dancing, but its cuts of Astaire and Charise on TV in the background. A harsh reminder of how poor Gere and Lopez do it. Poor Susan Sarandon is terribly miscast as the suspicious wife, but she tries hard to make convincing the implausible spouses conflict sub plot which is near laughable. A good film to wait for the DVD",,Anonymous,Music
Song in the trailer,"this is a long shot but there is a snippet of a song in the theatrical trailer for this movie and i was wondering if anyone could tell me who does it and the name of it. the only lyrics i could make out were ""my imagination"" and ""the world is a friendly place"" but i could be wrong. it's at the point in the trailer when the voice over guy says, ""one night he looks up"" then there's a slight pause and the song starts and plays in the background until richard gere is learning to dance and he says ""when we go forward"" and he falls then the song stops abruptly and another song starts. i've got it down to an exact science because i work at blockbuster video and the trailer is on our promo DVD this month. if anyone has any information on this song please share!! here's a link to the trailer -> http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shall_we_dance/trailers.php?bc=84 make sure you click on the theatrical trailer. thanks a bunch!!!!",,Anonymous,Music
read my comment for my summary on this movie,"After watching the movie Shall We Dance, I found that it can be comparable it to Billy Elliot. Within the movies the characters of John and Billy were both afraid to tell people they were taking dance lessons. This movie was considered to be a romantic comedy where a bored, overworked Estate Lawyer, upon first sight of a beautiful instructor, signs up for ballroom dancing lessons.The main character John Clark seems to be having a great relationship with his wife. But he feels like he can not tell his wife about him taking lessons. The reasoning behind this is unclear, but it seems like he will cheat on his wife with the dance instructor. Of course after watching the movie you see he doesn't commit such an act. In the scene where he travels home everyday on the train and passes the dance studio is very affective. We are uncertain if he will follow through and end up taking the lessons.When John finally starts dance lessons he really isn't that great. He hides it from everyone at home and work. His family starts to see strange behaviors in him, such as peeking in on him in his room and he is dancing around by himself. They are curious to know what he has been up to; his wife goes on and hires a private investigator to see if he is cheating on her. He then follows John and sees he goes to dance classes.The best scene in the movie is when John has to perform in the dance competition. He realizes he is really good at something and debates sharing it with his family. When his wife and daughter found out, they went to his dance competition. He messed up when he saw them and his daughter yelled ""yeah dad."" His family then walked out on him and his performance. From that moment he decided he didn't want to dance anymore. His wife wouldn't let him do that because she saw how good he was.I would recommend showing this film to people who enjoy learning about dance. The dancing in this movie is choreographed very well and gives the viewers something to focus on. Overall this is a very enjoyable movie.",,Anonymous,Music
This movie was lousy,Again Hollywood is not getting it! Profanity and gay scenes just thrown in at the end of a movie for shock value is not what the Christians in this country want to see portrayed to our youth. It is a choice not a lifestyle and you ruin every movie that you for no reason put this trash in. Richard Gere is a fine actor but if this is where his career is heading then I and my family and friends will find another actor to support. I will bring this up at every chance I have as this is getting to be too much for the decent people to pay hard earned money to see. Get it Hollywood! As this is only the beginning of the mandate you were handed on Nov 2nd. Don't take this country down with your filth. Our children deserve better than you think. They have a right to see movies that are decent and portray good values.,,Anonymous,Music
Great Cast; Good Dancing,"What a surprise this movie was. I expected it to be dull and by the numbers, but Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez all turn in good performances. The supporting cast is also top notch: Bobby Cannavale, Anita Gillette, Lisa Ann Walter, Stanley Tucci, Richard Jenkins, and Omar Miller are all terrific.Gere plays a long-married and bored lawyer who tries to find some fun in life. Sarandon is his busy wife and Lopez is a defensive ballroom dance teacher. The wife of course assumes he's having an affair and hires a detective. The odd ducks in the dance class all become friends and become supporters for each other. There is a dance contest and some nice storyline resolutions.Gere is loose and funny as the lawyer and actually does better dance moves here than in his acclaimed performance in Chicago. Lopez also does some good dancing, and Sarandon smolders as the jealous wife. Gillette has a good role as Miss Mitzi the dance school owner. Cannavale is hilarious as the tough guy who thinks dancing will draw women to him. Tucci is also very funny as the closet heterosexual who loves to wear sequins and dance. Jenkins is winning as the detective, and Miller is good as the fat guy. Walter almost steals the film as the loud, obnoxious woman who spends all her spare time training for the big dance contest.Shall We Dance starts slowly but once it gets going it's a winner.",,Anonymous,Music
a good movie? go and watch the original then,"i really don't understand Hollywood,when its near fall times or Christmas they always release movies according to the main event,to hit the spot...thats OK for me,since it doesn't disturb me(every man has his right to be ""clever"" ) but the thing is.. they do it bad,no matter what they use for building the movie up.i want to discuss about THE original shall we dance? since i see jennifer lopez in different points of view,save an actress, and richard gere? OK for my girlfriend,but he is not my type(in acting part of course ;) )shall we dance was one of the best movies that i watched so far,because, it was based on an ordinary story,with ordinary people in an ordinary life, and adding the unique Japanese culture,made it a masterpiece since the native people in japan(for the part that they have focused on) doesn't have a habit of expressing their emotions of love easily save kissing in public.but in American culture the magic of that invisible barrier was easily destroyed by the gere-ish looks and jenny-ish smiles.as being a person with no technical knowledge on movie stuff i can only say that if you watch a good movie,it doesn't mean that you can reproduce it well with shiny actors/actresses..it was an insult for the original movie...",,Anonymous,Music
Great Picture!,"What wouldn't be a great movie with Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez dancing! Although I have never seen the original movie, this new version is awesome!Richard Gere does an outstanding performance of a guy who needed to have more happiness in his life. He joins a dance class and falls in love with it. Jennifer Lopez does a superb job of playing the dumped-by-her-old-partner dance instructor who almost falls for Gere. Susan Sarandon does just as good, portraying the role of Gere's wife who is unaware of her husbands dancing. The dancing that is performed by Gere and Lopez is unbelievable and is greatly performed.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dancing, music, or romantic comedies. No matter if you like ball room dancing, or break dancing, this movie has something for you!",,Anonymous,Music
A great movie!,"I saw this movie last weekend and was really impressed. It's sweet, funny and the performances are great. Even those who aren't crazy about Jennifer Lopez will have to concede that she's well cast here. It was lovely and poignant and the dance scenes were incredible. There are not many movies around that don't rely on gratuitous, sex, violence and special effects to make their point but this is one. I think this movie will be a huge hit, along the lines of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. People are starved for a good story, well-told that brightens your day and this is it. I hope people flock to this movie so that moviemakers get the idea that it's okay to make movies that are uplifting and sweet. I also hope it is remembered during awards time.",,Anonymous,Music
A lovely movie on his own,"Purists would harp on how the original Japanese version is better. It's probably true (I adore the original) but this movie stands on its own just fine. Thank you very much. I think there's merit to bringing this wonderful story to the American sensibility. Is it perfect? No (nor was the original, which was a little too slow for the American taste). But it's a great movie suitable for everyone in these cynical times. It's great fun for the entire family, and it doesn't hit you over the head with a 2x4. Great performances all around.It's light. It's entertaining. And it puts a smile on your face. If anything, this may prompt people to go rent the original.",,Anonymous,Music
I Liked It,"SHALL WE DANCE? (2004) **** A workaholic Estate Lawyer comes home every night to a rather lonely life. He is drawn to the prospect of taking weekly dance lessons to find fulfillment in his life. It's essentially a basic, relational idea between a man's loneliness and the emotional release through dance that allows leading man Richard Gere and co-star Jennifer Lopez to show their stuff (or lack thereof) on the dance floor. There are enough touching moments that guarantee at least a wide grin.Rating System***** Excellent **** Good *** Fair ** Poor * Bad",,Anonymous,Music
This is old style Hollywood at it's finest. Entertaining plus...,"This 2004 version of ""Shall We Dance"" was, I believe, written by Wells the Under The Tuscan Sun lady. She sure knows some formulas to help you experience a full gamut of emotion. The movie moves along well and has plenty of humor and good character development. Over all it was a wonderful movie that holds your interest well. It has the feel of an old Hollywood film that we have come to enjoy for the sheer enjoyment of the actors and story. You know before the days when Reeves could fly, and the other Reeves could kick you in the face while being suspended in mid air. The ending was the only part of the film that made me question the film and say, ""WAIT A MINUTE HERE"". Shouldn't they have stopped here? I heard myself saying ""why did they put that in?"" OK they are taking you to a completeness of closure on all the characters...BUT, even though I questioned their ending, I could not help but smile as I left the theatre. Without giving details away, just go see this film for the pure enjoyment of the fairly lighthearted story, humor, warm feel and good experience. If you don't analyze too much, you can really be entertained by watching this film. Is it a chick flick? I have to say ""YES"". I am a 56 year old straight male... Did I enjoy this movie? An unequivocal, yes! This movie is Under The Tuscan Sun times 3! WARNING - If you are a football loving, domestic beer drinking, bratwurst eating, burping you know where scratching couch potato, it would be best to stay at home and watch this one if your wife or girlfriend rents it.",,Anonymous,Music
Great Hollywood Film,"Shall We Dance surprised me. Big time. I usually don't like romantic comedies. But this one works, amazingly. It's light, funny, smart, with a great soundtrack. The scenes that use Peter Gabriel's The Book of Love always get to me. Beautiful stuff, wonderfully executed.It's a remake of, arguably, a superior Japanese film that tells the sweet story of an unhappy lawyer who's life is reinvigorated with of all things, ballroom dancing.Are parts of the film predictable? Sadly, yes. My guess is the original screenplay by Audrey Wells was superior to the final studio approved version. But it all still works very well.Don't listen to the cold hearted naysayers who bash this flawed gem. I saw it multiple times at the theater and each time there was a great vibe in the audience. It seemed like everyone left loving this movie. It's cool to see Jennifer Lopez make a good movie again. I can't remember digging anything of hers since Out of Sight. Kudos all round.",,Anonymous,Music
No...let's not. You might think I like you or something.,"Eeeeeuuuugh.OK, let's not pander here. Bearing in mind that the original film carried with it a social significance that this version lacks, a strong effort from performers such as Richard Gere and Stanley Tucci is weighed down by the two-tone performance that Jennifer Lopez phones in. Lopez should be blocked from any further attempts to make films. This is a cold, cruel fact, and yet it seems to elude most people in Hollywood.Looking at the other performances in the film, Richard Gere seems to have finally rediscovered his niche in Hollywood. Following his work in ""Chicago"", giving a graceful man a chance to show that he can not only dance, but dance incredibly well, bodes well and seems to hearken back to the golden days of cinema. Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire are poorly represented these days when ""You Got Served"" is the closest approximation we have to the Fosse legacy.Susan Sarandon...well, she has her fans, she has her talents, but I will never understand the idea of her being ""sexy"", looking to me more like the aliens in ""They Live"". Casting her as Gere's wife seems confusing given her own dominating screen presence; she seems through a chunk of the film to be closer to handing him his butt than wondering why he's suddenly shaking it. A talented woman miscast.Stanley Tucci...brilliant. If this doesn't give him at least consideration for a Golden Globe or Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, then he will be the most robbed man since Prince John.And then there's J-Lo. To paraphrase Bill Corbett, she wanders around either looking like she's got gas or has been slapped with a dead fish. The effects to make her skin seem lustrous instead make her look like she's about to re-enact a female-led production of ""Halloween"". Michael Myers-ballroom style!There is almost no chemistry between Lopez and Gere. He is outgoing, reaching his co-stars with a vibrancy reminiscent of his heyday in ""Pretty Woman"". Lopez, however, turns even being aloof into an exercise in tedium, doubtless wondering whether or not she can add a slash to her name (""...singer/dancer/actress/pro bowler...?"")Would I recommend this film? The original version, certainly. If this version were on TV, sure. Watch for Gere and Tucci primarily. Better still to get the video out so you can, like most people, fast forward on to the better parts and get pics of her elsewhere.",,Anonymous,Music
2004: Add free dance lessons to Gere's tax return,"Not to be cynical, Richard Gere has been great in my humble opinion; for so many years he's survived one film after another; after all the critics he has a niche; he can show up anywhere and create an interest and $$$ in whatever he does. However, why didn't someone else take the lead in this one; can you see Nicholos Cage and maybe Jennifer Beals as the dance instructor? So Richard's character needed the dance lessons (and maybe some vavoom) at his age. So maybe Richard wished for the lead in ""Saturday Night Fever"" almost thirty years ago. He never had a chance against Travolta on the dance floor, admittedly, so one way to get some free dance lessons.Did we all notice an element of ""Officer and a Gentleman"" as he goes to his wife at her fancy department store job? And the ""Animal House"" resemblance as one of three 'nerds' on the bench during 'pledge week' only at the dance hall; the list of comparisons and bits of humor are available. However, that's what makes the film disjointed with juxtaposition. The dance contest appeared to be a high school football game with all the clamoring and cheering; then the Cinderella story in reverse (poor little rich estate attorney) as he's distracted by his yelling daughter at the dance competition and crashes to the floor along with his hopes of finally doing something big for himself.Then his wife played by Susan Sarrandan, who he must have really been attracted to at one time until the mid-life caused this streak of independence. He didn't have the wisdom or respect to tell her he was interested in dance; maybe she could come along too? But then we wouldn't have this particular movie; shows us what may happen as we just consider ourselves rather than include our partners.Then the complication, expense, and conflict this secret caused in their lives with the PI. Although funny at times I'm thinking all this could've been avoided with intelligent people; so why are we watching this movie? Once a movie leads to predictability and frustration I've lost interest. Similar to 'ffolks' with Tom Selick and Don Amiche, the first half looks interesting while the second half drops like a rock with sadness and frustration.This movie could've been better, sexier, especially with all these stars noted for that. Susan was great for that in 'Bull Durham' and even the 'Banger Sisters' while Richard has gotten through many movies on charm alone.The only indication of spark between the two that I'm still curious about was the sticky note on the bathroom mirror; was that a love note or just a shopping list?Seems like the ""Dance Hall Association of America"" (DHAA for short, a fictional name as far as I know about dance associations) would really like this movie; not too much on the negative aspect of dance halls we should be aware of by now (see many news items); the appearance of dance as a positive, family oriented activity like Saturday night bowling was a message in the background, an imaginary fancy of the DHAA perhaps. Maybe dance studios could've experience a renewed interest if only this movie had been better. Well, Richard got to learn to dance a little better with some added money in the bank, maybe for a ""mid-life"" Porsche (with all the maintenance expenses, ha).",,Anonymous,Music
Sometimes a person's just gotta dance!,"What does a man who has achieved the proverbial American dream do when he realizes he is bored with his life? A middle-aged man who feels too embarrassed by his riches to admit his feelings of apathy to anyone. Not his coworkers, not his friends, and certainly not his wife. A man whose conscience tells him that revealing his innermost thoughts would be tantamount to admitting personal failure and give rise to a sense of unworthiness for the good life he has achieved despite the happiness he hasn't found or retained.Richard Gere is faced by this dilemma in Shall We Dance, a remake of the popular 1996 Japanese film of the same name. Gere plays Chicago lawyer John Clark who seems to have it all---good health, white-collar occupation, house in the suburbs, attractive wife (played by Susan Sarandon) and well-adjusted children---but realizes that all he has is a life marked by a routine broken only by the daily train commute to and from work. His stable, secure and contented home life, which would be the envy of most, simply lacks spirit, excitement and, for Mr. Clark, joy. In any other film looking for easy solutions, Gere would have to become an embezzler or have an affair. But not in this entertaining and warm-hearted film.Gere's character transcends his humdrum existence through ballroom dancing. Sounds simple, but it's not. He's got to learn, which means taking lessons. Jennifer Lopez is his inspiration, but he also meets other interesting people, emerging with a renewed lease on life as a result of his musical quest. There are a few bumps along the way, but the movie's tone is nothing less than nice and pleasant. It entertains without insulting its audience.Jennifer Lopez is also very good in a minor role, and proves she still has her moves as the assistant dance instructor who helps Gere get his rhythm. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as the straight-laced lawyer with a secret alter ego he unleashes on the dance floor every night. Much of this is in the original Japanese film, including tap dancing under the desk and dancing while waiting for a train. But this American remake is definitely worth seeing to experience the elation that Gere experiences on screen.While the original Japanese film had more drama, pathos, and suspense, this version achieves its cinematic vision by a comfortable comedic touch that is sure to please. This is a nice film with nothing to offend. It's bright and charming entertainment that also gives viewers pause for thought. Shall We Dance deserves an 8/10.",,Anonymous,Music
"A great ""feel good"" movie for both me and my husband!","We saw ""Shall We Dance"" at a sneak preview last week and it was fantastic...for once both me and my husband loved the same movie. It moved quickly, the characters that Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez played were extremely likable and the co-stars were equally as good. I loved the music and the plot and would see it again. This is definitely the type of role that Richard Gere should always be in, although I would watch him in any movie, but I think he excels in the light-hearted type of movie. He is an excellent dancer. Pretty much this movie makes you walk out of the theatre feeling like you should follow your heart and do whatever makes you happy.",,Anonymous,Music
Interesting remake considering cultural differences,"The tension in the original Japanese story -- husbands and wives dancing in public considered scandlous -- is missing in Richard Gene/Jennifer Lopez version. Still the essence of the story, people looking for a zest for life most of us are missing, comes through even though our attitudes toward ballroom dancing are so different from the characters in the Japanese version. Dance scenes showed passion, humor and athleticism. Tucci shows us another facet of his talent, and while he doesn't portray the closet dancer character as flaky as the Japanese counterpart, he is convincing, showing us how much he'd like to be something he isn't allowed to be in the ""real"" world. He is courageous in his ""coming out. This is a delightful confection and leaves you feeling satisfied.",,Anonymous,Music

Enjoyable,"Actually, if I hadn't seen the original Japanese version, I probably would have given this a higher rating. However, it didn't quite compare to the original, which was simpler and more charming. I like both versions well enough to watch more than once. I thought Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon were good. Detective Devine was a little lacking compared to his Japanese counterpart simply because you wouldn't expect the Japanese detective to respond the way he did to the surveillance. Jennifer Lopez was the weak link in this story; her character wasn't as developed as the Japanese, and her performance was one-dimensional. She didn't bring enough personality to the part to be the big catalyst the story line demands. Other than her weak performance, I thought it was a pretty good movie.",,Anonymous,Music

Though I got the part about Gere's character feeling like something is missing, and his infatuation with the Lopez character. I did not get the part where the wife seemed angry with Gere's character at the dance competition.In all the move was quite good, and J-Lo's character, I thought was played well if not a little stiff in the first scenes. I loved the dancing and found the comedy fit very well.The supporting characters were done quite well, except the private investigator.

An Acceptable American RC,"RC - Romantic Comedy:Ebert once said that there are no surprises with a RC -- and all you can do is critique it on the basis of what it claims to be. I agree. This was a very nice Friday romantic comedy that I found appealing, sweet and, while not particularly clever, completely in keeping with the American woman's heart. We like Romantic Comedies. We don't want to think too much either (we do enough in our every day lives thank you). I admit that I was a little dumbfounded by the casting of Gere in this part, but I bought it (along with my popcorn and large coke). I found all the character actors quite charming and stellar in their roles. And frankly, when I left the movie theater -- I left with a big smile. In the political climate of today - I kinda needed that smile and thankful that Shall We Dance was able to deliver.I loved that dance scene between Gere and Lopez: hope they do an MTV release for it. The shadows and light brought out the physicality of both performers to full visual effect - not anyone could have pulled that off.

Real life resonates in this movie!,"I continue to be touched by the real life perspectives that are presented in this movie, and so many of the comments (dialogue) from (and between) the characters resonate deeply for me about life! From the beginning when Gere's lawyer character is describing how legal papers seem to be a ultra-simplistic summation of some people's lives, to Sarandon's depth of focus when talking about bearing witness to each others' lives so that we can each know that our life matters, even among billions of people on the planet... and then Gere's very human admission about feeling guilty for ""...wanting to be happier, when we (already) have so much..."" speak volumes to me about my own life every time I watch this movie.

"Unbelievable..a movie that is funny, romantic, beautiful to watch and supports goodness!","I saw this movie in a invitation only preview with a followup Q&A with the director. It was a totally enjoyable experience and I will spend my own money to see it again with my husband and tell al my friends and relatives that this is ""not to be missed"".Richard Gere plays the hardworking probate attorney with the beautiful home family and wife whom he loves but rarely sees because of her demanding work as a top buyer. Is it so unusual that a man would have a yearning for something more? Initially lured by the vision of a beautiful woman he sees looking out the dance studio window from his train home from work, he decides to take ballroom dance lessons. What is unusual... is for a movie to depict that this inner yearning is ultimately for more expression of beauty and creativity in one's life which is necessary for real happiness.The dance lesson scenes provide great laughs while encouraging compassion ...and if you love dancing anyway there is much to enjoy in the ballroom competition scenes. Richard Gere does a great job and may even encourage your spouse to learn to dance...if you're lucky.The elitist movie critics will probably pan this one because its message supports the concepts of loyalty and morality and everyday kindness to our fellow human beings....all of which are not deemed sophisticated or 'deep' enough motivators for the tastes of most movie critics who see themselves as superior in intellect to the rest of us.The people involved in making and directing and producing this beautiful movie can feel good about contributing something so entertaining and beautiful to watch while courageously reinforcing the values of moral faithfulness and goodness of the human spirit.
