A great Trek (begrudgingly),"I have to confess to being one of those people who never thought they should 'reboot' the original Star Trek franchise. William Shatner and co were so engrained in their respective roles that I didn't think anyone could fill their exact shoes (even if they were supposed to be their younger selves).I was wrong.Star Trek (XI) is undoubtedly the best of the franchise since The Wrath of Khan. If follows the early years of the most famous crew in sci-fi history. Yes, every actor nails his or her character (possibly with the minor exception of Simon Pegg as Scotty, but that's a minor gripe). Also, this isn't just 'Star Trek The Early Years' - the story cleverly weaves in the old mythology - I won't say too much on that in case you're not aware of how it all plays out.I will say that (if you can forgive JJ Abrams slightly overused 'lens flare effects') it is the most exciting of all the Trek movies. There's plenty of action and decent special effects. It doesn't quite rival Star Wars - it seems to be able to maintain its 'alternativeness' to the other great sci-fi franchise. It doesn't just breathe new life into the franchise (Star Trek X was a little disappointing), it makes 'Trek' accessible to the masses. If you don't know your Tribbles from your Borg, it really doesn't matter - this starts everything again and you don't need to know the backstory - you only need to be in for a good, popcorn-munching, sci-fi ride.May this franchise live long and prosper.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Review from comicbookculture.net,"Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night. Until we meet again, ""Live long and Prosper!""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a production - cheesy bits forgiven!,"There was no way that this reboot was going to avoid all references to either the original series of Star Trek or the other spin-off series - anyone going in to see this film had to accept that as a given. But any cheesy bits (of which there were relatively few) are blown away by the sheer beauty and bravado of this film.I was a fairly big Trekkie in my youth, but in the last 10 years only really kept up with it by watching a few new episodes here and there and seeing the big screen outings (OK, I admit that I have all 10 films on special edition DVD - £47 was a bargain!) - but Abrams' vision here has me thinking the new franchise will be even better than what has come before.What made this film special for me was not the story (remarkably good, bearing in mind that, like the first film in any new franchise, it's backbone was character development). What made this film for me was the....photography? Can you even call CGI photography? Well, either way, this film was a visual feast. The way that scale was conveyed was breath-taking. I'm not sure whether I read this somewhere or if I can take credit for it myself, but the difference came in the way that Abrams shoved aside the traditional Star Trek view of Enterprise as a lumbering naval ship and took a more Star Wars-esquire dogfight approach. This has set a high standard for a new era of Star Trek that I hope will spawn at least a couple more films.It's not that I wasn't impressed with the character development, the acting, the script or the story - it's just that this film looked so gorgeous that I haven't been able to think of anything else since I saw it last night! But sufficed to say, this was overall an excellent feature. It might not quite deserve a 100% rating, but it's worth more than 90% in my eyes - so, by rounding up, it gets 10/10 from me! Final warning: see this film in the cinema. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD. It. Will. Not. Do. It. Justice.JJ, you've won a fan!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"10 out of 10, an incredible reboot...!!!","So I managed to go to the world premiere at the Sydney opera house last night. While I will not ruin the film before its release by delivering a shot by shot review here I will say that JJ Abrams is quite possibly the smartest film maker on the planet. Managing to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of the original series/movies while still being completely respectful, action scenes that easily rival anything in Transformers, and space battles that are breathtaking. Now let me just say that while I do consider myself a big fan of Trek in all its forms, i don't have a uniform hanging in my wardrobe and I cant speak Klingon, but having said that I will say the movie is F###ING AMAZING...!!! Honestly, incredible film, do yourself a favour and see it as soon as it comes out. thanks, the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek for a new generation,"I am proud to call my self a Trekkie, I attend conventions, dress up and I even have ""Live Long and Prosper"" tattooed on my back. My family however, despite my best efforts, will watch the occasional episode but have never embraced the Star Trek world as I have. My husband took me along to the premier of Star Trek in London last night and thank you JJ you converted him in one film, I have been trying for 25 years! What JJ Abrams has done is create a film that can be enjoyed by all, its irrelevant whether or not you have seen Star Trek before, this film stands alone as brilliant entertainment. There are plenty of references to the original series to keep the fans happy. Of course there are going to be the ""hard core"" fans who will criticize certain aspects. I enjoyed seeing the lead actors imitate the characteristics of the original crew, Karl Urban as Dr Mcoy was particularly good. Good story line, plenty of humour, non-stop fast action, fantastic special effects, great acting from all the main ""crew"", Zacchary Quinto and Chris Pine especially. Can't wait for the next one to see more in-depth character development (of all the characters, not just Kirk and Spock and a moral dilemma which is at the heart of the best Star Trek. Film fans are going to love this film and that means Star Trek Lives Long and Prospers!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Thrilling adventure with great characters, maintains the spirit of the original series while appealing to a mass audience. A landmark blockbuster for sure","I'm a fan of ""Star Trek"", but not obsessive, having read only one ""Star Trek"" novel, owning no merchandise and only TOS in its entirety on DVD. I abhor ""Voyager"" but like every other Trek series, including ""Enterprise"" although nearly all of that show's especially good episodes are in the fourth season. My favorite remains TOS for its unforgettable characters, performances and stories, as well as the sense of camaraderie aboard the Enterprise.I hope I've established my feelings on Trek (after all there are Trekkers who think ""The Motion Picture"" is the best Trek film, and a lot of people seem to like ""Nemesis"") and what I truly value in it. As long as it wasn't overwhelmingly dumb I didn't require any sort of truly thoughtful sci-fi in this film, nor did I expect it. What I desired, what I can say with a deep, deep sigh of relief, I got, is a film brimming with confidence, energy, a sense of adventure, a suitably emotional story for the film's main characters, and, thank heavens, superb characterization.Using a plot device bring Nero, our Romulan villain played by Eric Bana, and Nimoy's Old Spock into the film, the writers Bob Orci and Alex Kurtzman maintain canon. While Trekkers will whinge about many things here no more canon contradiction happens here than in the Trek series following TOS. Instead of merely rebooting the series entirely and creating an entirely separate canon, the writers have fairly deftly worked this film into the existing Star Trek universe. It's an alternate (not mirror) universe story done well. A great deal to enjoy for Trekkers with throwbacks to the originals but there's also a lot to satisfy summer movie-goers. It's a very, very fast-paced film, the action scenes are exhilarating (and you can actually keep track of them), and there's a great deal of humorIt sounds almost unbelievable but they've actually managed to pull it off: they've made a ""Star Trek"" film which is a Trek film through and through and yet will still draw a bigger audience than any of the previous films, and moreover satisfy that audience. The film has been compared to ""Iron Man"" in more than one review the similarities are clear. Both films feature excellent dialogue and character interactions, swift, clever characterization, a minimum of laborious exposition, and also have a common flaw: a rushed plot which overall is almost a side plot. The only reboot to truly escape this pitfall thus far is ""Casino Royale"", which successfully told a very tight story and also consistently developed Bond as a character. Bana is menacing enough and his ship is well-designed but overall he's no Khan or Chang and was much better-written in the Countdown prequel comic than in the film itself. There are also a series of massive contrivances to get everything where it needs to be which will have viewers rolling their eyes, but even these are handled well by the script, which is smooth and fast as opposed to clunky and sterile. Plus, they're necessary for this origin story not to be a typical boring origin story and become what it is.The partnership of director Abrams and cinematographer Mindel will annoy some people with their deliberate use of lens flares as well as shaky cam in scenes (not in a Greengrass or worse, Peter Berg style, but merely a slightly unstable camera), but overall I found it to be consistently involving and thrilling to watch, with good visual storytelling throughout. I also quite enjoyed the lens flares. It's not quite on par with Nicholas Meyer's attempts for me but still good, and interesting. The score by Michael Giacchino suffers from familiarity and a lack of individual identity, but works well with the film itself.Chris Pine is absolutely terrific as Kirk, doing so much more than a Shatner impression and creating something of his own character (and it is, after all, an alternate Kirk) while absolutely nailing several of the trademark attitudes and behavior of the Kirk we all know and love. Much more than a pretty face, Pine's in for mega-stardom after this. Quinto's Spock is really quite terrific and much more nuanced than expected, and Spock's emotional story (and backstory) in the film is well-written as is Kirk's (though Spock gets a more emotional and better overall arc for sure). Pegg is fantastic as Scotty, used here mostly as comic relief. Urban's McCoy is the closest to an impersonation but overall just a joy and a pleasure to behold. Cho's alright as Sulu, who doesn't really get much to do (heck, when did he ever?), though Uhura is surprisingly prominent and well-played by Zoe Saldana. Yelchin as Chekhov is the only really problematic casting choice for me, he really overdoes the accent and takes you out of the film a bit. Bruce Greenwood as Pike nails the character and in a crucial role Leonard Nimoy shines yet again as Spock.Abrams' ""Star Trek"" isn't quite tight enough and emotional enough to compete with ""The Wrath of Khan"", isn't as much fun for me as ""The Voyage Home"", but overall is probably the third best Trek film to date, on par with ""The Undiscovered Country"". It's a fairly new direction, yet totally faithful to Trek where it needs to be: in spirit. In a world of dreary blockbusters and 'dark' reboots, this Trek, though grittier in terms of design than anything before, shines, from opening to closing, as an example of optimistic, exciting, thrilling, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable adventure cinema, as well as a great addition to Trek's long, long history.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun,"As someone with a longstanding fondness for most things Trek (I've seen most of the movies and quite a few of the shows), I have to say that JJ & Co did a fine job with this picture; the character dynamics were broadly satisfying, the action scenes entertaining and the set pieces well put together. Most of all I was impressed with the lightness of touch of the whole venture - it would be very easy to criticise the picture for making what could be considered significant changes to certain parts of Trek lore, but given that the changes were accomplished with such comfort and confidence makes them, in my view, perfectly acceptable.With regards to the acting characterisation, everyone was pretty much solid, with perhaps the exception of Sulu, who I thought didn't have much to do. Kudos, though, to Zoe Saldana's loveliness as Uhura and also, especially, to Chris Pine as Kirk - I had always thought Spock was my favourite character, but it looks like I may have to reassess; Pine lives and breathes that Kirk moxie exquisitely and he'll be great fun to watch in future instalments.With regards to plot, it's pretty good; there is a decent sense of internal logic to it, without it being too overwrought. True, there are a number of points where you might think, ""Blimey, that's serendipitous,"" but as I'd already suspended my disbelief to accept the possibility of time travelling green-blooded alien from the planet Vulcan, these things really didn't bother me at all. Plus there were a number of points in the movie where they were saying, ""We were pulling this kind of shtick 20+ years ago, and you loved it then; run with us on this one,"" and I was happy to.Oh, and most importantly of all, the movie is fun; it has the good sense to not take itself too seriously, despite remaining well aware of that sense of pomp and importance that all great character dramas should have, and that isn't a bad thing at all.How this movie will bear up to repeat viewings, I'm not certain yet, but at the premiere, it was a blast.Addendum: It's a month plus since I originally wrote this and I have seen the film three times in total now - the opening ten minutes remain a manipulative marvel that the remainder of the film struggles to match, the coincidences and conveniences seem even more far fetched than ever and the jokes seem even more silly BUT I still fancy seeing it again, so I guess it must work for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi Classic By All Means,"I should start this by saying that I always leaned more toward Star Wars than Star Trek. I've memorized much of the Star Wars epic sci-fi fantasy and numerous characters, but the universe of Star Trek is one I have not really explored. The beauty of this film is that you can be a hard core Trek-fan or a simple lover of sci-fi or action and still find this an incredibly enjoyable movie. I myself was surprised when I first saw it, seeing all the relatable humor it was pouring out, but unlike the redundant idiocy of let's say Michael Bay, the jokes are welcome and don't go too far.The cast is pretty well put together, and each character is pretty memorable and involved quite well. Eric Bana was excellent as Nero, not to mention Bruce Greenwood is awesome as well. Zachary Quinto is the beloved Spock and for one of those hyper-intelligent characters it's a character you will end up feeling emotionally drawn to. The story never drags at all and it's all together a pretty well written piece of sci-fi I must add. To be honest Chris pine is great in the movie, it's just that at times he too much of an archetype 'bad-ass', dare I say it? How many times have I seen a drunken protagonist in a bar starting a fight with a guy and/or trying to get a girl who views him as trash. Other than that, though, he does fine, and the rest of the cast is no less than good.The cinematography was beautiful on its own, let alone the action scenes. Speaking of which, a new bar for space battles has been set. And the score by Michael Giacchino and Alexander Courage was not too shabby. In fact I thoroughly embraced it. I consider it a must see, being one of those rare sci-fi gems anyone can enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome - highly recommend,"I was one of the few lucky fans who attended the Sydney premiere and my impression was ""Wow!"" The use of a well known Roddenberry plot device to reset the franchise was a brilliant idea and means the franchise can now move forward without the ""FANS"" shouting ""canon!"" The movie itself was brilliantly cast and performed with each actor being enough like the original to be believable in the role without the over the top acting that was part of TV when it all began in the 1960's.The special effects are top notch.Its a film which you can take anyone who enjoys sci-fi to, not just someone who knows the last 40+ years of Trek.So what level of fan am I? I own 3 costumes, attend conventions and appear in ""Trekkies 2"", and yet loved Enterprise because from the first episode I simply said its was in an alternate universe, its the same but different. I view this film in the same light, same but different.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Truly Glorious Enterprise,"As a complete and utter fan of LOST I ventured down to Sydney on Tuesday for the World Premiere of Star Trek to feast my eyes on JJ Abrams new venture. I have never seen Star Trek. Not one episode, Not one movie. Yet the idea of JJ Abrams attempting to breathe creative life into a franchise drew me to the Sydney Opera House to meet my Idol and to see just what he can do.As the lights went down in the glorious Concert Hall and the vibrant cast and crew thanked the audience and took their seats an anxious hush swept the hall from united Trekkies and newcomers alike. As Paramount, Spyglass and the Bad Robot flitted across the screen Michael Giacchino's score pulsed through the audience and the film began.From the first stunning visuals of a pre-Enterprise time to the final iconic sweeping space shots Star Trek is fully and wholly back, completely engaging for Fan and newcomers alike. Easily grabbing a mainstream audience and yet still retaining the in-crown jokes and nuances of the original Universe, Abrams new Trek is quite the achievement.The actors are superb and the appearance of Leonard Nimoy and Eric Bana takes the tale to the beyond.It is easy to see why Paramount has held on to the innovative creative Bad Robot team ready for a sequel as Trekkie storytelling is reinvented for today.As always I was blown away with the power and creative precision that JJ Abrams brought to the screen. As a final note I recommend this film for everyone who has ever looked to dream up the impossible, to take an idea that you love onto the next level, a feat achieved by the truly glorious Abrams and crew.A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
JJ Abrams needs to cool it on the strobe lights,"What on earth goes on in JJ Abrams' head when he tries to blind his audience with those stupid effects?

It's got space battles, weird alien species, trials and tribulations, strife between the crew of the ship... everything you'd want in a Star Trek movie.

""" I   have   been   and   ever shall   be   your   friend ""","There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled "" Star Trek "" is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Yeah, not Star Trek of old, but great fun.","For folks who dissed this movie, and the second, because it wasn't the Star Trek of yester year, get over it. Roddenbury rolling over in his grave? Oh, please. The events in the first movie somehow made all the other off-shoots impossible? Yikes! How does anything in this movie affect the series with Piccard, Janeway, etc.? Give it a break, eh?Yeah, both movies had some corny lines and one or two ridiculous scenarios (Spock and Uhura making out?), but the first two movies in this reboot were great fun. The actors were brilliant even when their lines weren't, the action decent. Was either movie award-worthy? No, but not every movie has to be in order to enjoy it. I wasn't disappointed. Both kept me very well entertained. Sometimes it's good just to sit back, relax, enjoy, and not take everything so damn seriously.Now, the third installment is altogether another matter. While it did have its moments, it was really terribly written. There is a limit to how much even good actors can do with pervasively bad lines, and how much slop a viewer can put up with. And if Hollywood doesn't stop with their ""wokeness"", I think I'll have to stick with foreign flicks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL!,"Before analyzing Star Trek, a few words: In the theater, skeptically, I waited for it to begin.

A little kid mesmerized by Forbidden Planet; a teen-ager, totally awed by 2001; a young adult, blown away by Star Wars! If you don't like this new Star Trek, do yourself a favor: forget about the Sci-Fi/Action genre for life!O. K...Where to begin? On almost every imaginable level, Star Trek really works! Solid character development, well, at least for this genre. Stunning, imaginative, cleverly original & at times, even dazzlingly artistic special effects. An intensely engaging story-line, that manages to pay homage to all that has gone before, but, at the same time presents multi-faceted character and plot elements few of us could have imagined beforehand. Without any spoilers, let's just say there is something in this for everyone! Glimpses of Kirk and Spock in their youth, both rebellious in different ways. Hints of romance between major characters, previously unsuspected. Kirk and Spock starting out as rivals, but becoming friends as a result of an ingenious plot twist! And extremely well-conceived and orquestrated action sequences that will make you feel as if you'd been catapulted into hyper-drive!

Perfect introduction to Star Trek,"Shamefully this 2009 movie was pretty much my first full experience of what the Star Trek franchise has to offer. I have never been a fan and was completely new to the series. I have since begun to understand its following although I'm glad to have started with JJ Abrams remake as it was the perfect introduction. As a science fiction action movie it ticked all the boxes and had a well crafted cast which made watching this movie thoroughly enjoyable.

Loved it and just re-watched 10 yrs after - it still holds up.,"So many negative reviews from 'fans'. I am a fan. I'm not the kind of fan who goes to conventions and my entire life is not consumed by Star Trek. However, I watched the first episode of TOS when it aired in 1966. I was 10 years old, and my entire world changed. I started to imagine a future - a future like nothing anyone had ever thought of before. That show was the catalyst for my love of the sci-fi genre, for many books and films over the years, in particular the many entries in the world of Star Trek. Honestly, this is a good little movie. It has the elements of Star Trek that make it what we loved - and love. The Prime Directive, the Enterprise, the themes of friendship and courage - the crew, the comedy, the rebellious nature of Captain Kirk - the new cast did such a great job portraying these beloved characters, I just felt I was seeing them all again, and I liked it very much. Don't get so hung up on what is Canon, and what is scientifically possible, that you forget to enjoy a tall tale - a story - with characters that are larger than life, and with whom we fall a little bit in love every time.

A reboot worthy of new fans.,"Just caught an advanced screening of this tonight. As one who never really enjoyed Star Trek, I found myself pleasantly surprised with how likable this movie was.The casting itself is one of the great pluses to begin with, especially with Zachary Quinto who manages to make being Spock look so easy. Simon Pegg delivers very well as Scotty with funny moments, but not being too over the top - good job there. And Anton Yelchin definitely steals the show in any of his scenes as Chekov.Kirk was well-casted too, but the others definitely warranted a greater mention.The greatest thing about this movie was that it managed to be genuinely funny, without compromising itself. There are so many brief moments and quick gags that work with snap precision. The worst things I can say about this film was the somewhat weak plot and the superficial character development (understandable, given how many characters were shoved at us). But everything else was awesome enough to divert focus from the minuses.If you've never seen anything Trek, or maybe saw one or two episodes - you will like this. If you've spent your life hating Trek - you will still like this.I certainly do. 8/10(PS: Stargate: Atlantis fans be ready to spot Paul McGillion as the Barracks Officer)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Underwhelmed, almost disappointed","I have been a Trekkie since it came out on NBC. I've seen them all, all the movies, all the shows. This one disappointed me.No, I am not disappointed by the new cast. Most were good, especially Zachary Quinto as Spock. Quinto showed great versatility, a completely different person than Sylar. What I am disappointed by is the new characters. The action of this new Spock were not that of the historic Spock. His on screen romance with Uhura simply did not fit.Also, I am totally disappointed by the lack of any sense of following the chronology of time events we have seen throughout Star Trek. Spock was a junior officer on the Enterprise when Chris Pike went down to Talos IV. That means the Enterprise could not have been on its maiden voyage. That's one small example of the screw-ups. Ranks, assignments, so many things just wrong.These are the faults of the writer and the director. J.J. Abrams, with his experience with Lost, surely knows better. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are from from Abrams's Fringe studio. I enjoy Fringe, but obviously they just are not up to Trek.People rave about special effects, but that does not impress me.

WOW are the only words to describe the movie,"after waiting for over a full year to get the movie, and watching it... I'm honestly amazed. I expected a lot, and got SOOOOOO much more... The plot is classic star trek, and, 'cause I'm a Trekkie ( :D ) at first I thought, wtf the killing of Kirk's father ain't mentioned in any of the series, or the movies. The start off was phenomenal. The corvette and the selection of music hit my nerve (in my language, that ain't as bad as it sounds :D ). the sound effects are even more wonderful, and the battle scenes are even better.

"Star Trek for people who don't like Star Trek. Basically, it's Star Wars.","The Star Trek the Trekkies have been fearing since this was announced: a dumbed-down Star Wars clone. As such, it's okay. It's a fairly entertaining space opera. It's fast paced and exciting. What it isn't is Star Trek. Star Trek is about man encountering the unknown and dealing with it with science and philosophy. There is weird stuff going on in this one - time travel, in particular, which in the original series was discovered early on and which served as the basis for many episodes and a couple of the movies - but the situation is urgent and the characters have no time to think about anything. It's just rush rush rush. The film does get most of the characters right, thankfully. Except for one instance, which I'll discuss shortly, the casting is brilliant. Zacahry Quinto in particular makes a perfect Spock, and I absolutely loved Simon Pegg as Scotty. Likewise, John Cho of the Harold & Kumar movies was a great choice for Sulu. Chekov doesn't belong, of course, because he wasn't on the Enterprise until later, but they got that wrong in The Wrath of Khan, too, so I guess I can't complain too much. The one exception to the excellent cast is Chris Pine as Kirk. He's excruciatingly bad. I'm certainly not asking him to impersonate Shatner - God no. But he doesn't capture any of Kirk's intelligence, or even charm. He's not quite as bad as, say, Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels, but he's in the same category. He's just a brash youngster whom you certainly wouldn't want captaining a vessel. The movie spends a heck of a lot of time showing how cool he is. Even when he's doing something smart, like outsmarting the Kobayashi Maru program, they never really depict him as being smart. We don't see him changing the program, as he infamously did, and it never feels like he believably could. There's some fun to be had here, but only dumb fun. Maybe they'll improve the formula some in the inevitable sequel. I'll definitely give it at least one more chance (the series that is; I have no desire to rewatch this film).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It sucked!,"Big time. from the design of the Enterprise, which I despised to the lame story which was completely hackneyed and unbelievable. What the heck did Nero do for 25 years? And why didn't he just fly to Romulus and warn them? And why is a MINING ship armed with a bazillion torpedoes? And I don't care if Kirk did just save the world, which he didn't do alone by the way, No military organization or even a quasi military organization is going to promote a newly graduated inexperienced cadet to captain. Only seven ships, or how ever many it was, were available out of a fleet of how many to save the earth?Thanks JJ for destroying Star Trek.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Abrams has boldly done what no man has done before,"And that is reinventing the Star Trek franchise, and giving it new life.Supposedly, according to some people's opinions, this tells of the early days of Kirk and Spock as if it is an origins story of Kirk and Spock. It could be taken this way. I, however, prefer to look at it actually as a continuation of the old franchise for reasons I will talk about later.Let me just say that everyone that was a part of this film deserves a round of applause. The acting and the behind the scenes work (all of it) was spot on, and I couldn't find any reason to not give this film a 10/10.Let me talk about the acting, because, while I could go on and on about the action scenes and the special effects, it's really the acting that stood out in this. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto: I can imagine what it's like for you guys to take on enormous roles as Kirk and Spock. Great job, you guys; you have made new fans of the series, and the old fans are proud of you guys.There are actually quite a lot of well-known actors and actresses here, but that doesn't deter the film, as it does in other films. We have John Cho playing helmsman Hikaru Sulu; Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek; Bruce Greenwood as USS Commanding Officer Pike; Simon Pegg as Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scot; Winona Ryder as Spock's mother Amanda Greyson; Zoe Saldana as Chief Communications Officer Uhura; Karl Urban as Chief Medical Officer McCoy; Anton Yelchin as USS Navigator and security/tactical officer Chekov; Eric Bana as Captain Nero; And... get ready, because a bomb is coming... Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime! That's right! Leonard Nimoy! Quinto must have been shaking in his boots at the thought of portraying Spock in front of Spock (literally!)! I know I would have. A great job to everyone here; you all did your job well.There is a lot of action, but before that happens, we see a little bit of back story to the Spock and Kirk characters, and because we get to know them, we start to care about them.Overall, it's a great film that gives more life to a classic series with humour, action, a great story, great acting, and some very pleasing special effects. This will please the usual Trekkie fan, and perhaps gain new ones. A solid 10/10 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great flick,"Casting of this movie could not have been better, stunning visual effects and masterful editing. Brilliant! Amazing job to all involved with this project, I hope to see more Star Trek movies made real soon. A solid mix of drama, action and comedy all rolled into one fantastic display of artistic ability. I can only hope to get onto such a project one day. I lean more towards scifi movies anyway like the Matrix and Lord of the Rings but by far the most surprising film of 2009 and beyond was this movie. I never watch a film more than once, even if I like it. I have watched this movie six times and have loved it every time.

If this was a spoof....,"...and a 150,000,000 dollar spoof (!) maybe this could be called entertainment, but it only succeeds in a surface reference to the original cast and leaves the audience waiting for something interesting to happen.Instead, we get one of the least imaginative ""back stories"" and an even lamer telling of those stories that have ever been mounted for a major motion picture.The cast is terrific, but they have nothing to do but try to hit a mark that some of the original actors did. Poor Leonard Nimoy is hauled out to mumble something or other about parallel universes which brings confusion to stupidity.The art direction and special effects are above average, but only that. They aren't used to awe or frighten; they're used as filler.Hopefully, someone will use this cast for something closer to what the original series did: Bring something thoughtful and interesting to consider, and have a clever way of telling that story.

Live long and prosper,A great modern take on Star Trek bringing in a series classic and making the story modern. The characters were well cast and well acted. The cinematography and CGI worked really well. The plot was followable even for non-nerds (me). A solid movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Uncanny Valley,"In CGI circles, when they talk of artificial beings and reality, there is a phenomenon called the ""uncanny valley.""The idea is simple. The closer you get to reality, say in a fake human, the more we are willing to believe it, until you get close. Then the graph of believability plummets until you have a human that is perfectly human. Almost real but not quite is the thing we least accept. Filmmakers know that if you fall into this uncanny valley, people will run away. ""Polar Express"" is often cited as an example, because if the people had been less people-like — perhaps as munchkins — we would have readily accepted it. Gollum seems real because he is not a person.The whole Star Trek franchise is based on staying away from this valley. It was cheesy by accident at first, but then by design. The effects were obvious, the acting of a particular style. Staying away from all the normal production values make it resonate more clearly; we are fairly adept at filling in the gaps in things like this.The one thing that they migrated to as the thing we were to accept as truly real and accepted as real was the spaceship. As the films evolved, this became more and more of the distraction. It was on the real side of that valley, allowing us to pull everything else on the other side over in our imaginations.But here, this new guy gets the formula all mixed up. This is not Star Trek, but an ordinary action movie with Star Trek allusions — and the same ship.Sure, the thing is expertly delivered, and the time travel tricks are interesting enough to keep us engaged. But the actual story is too close to being real. It tries too hard to matter, instead of being a Trek Fable. So it falls into this uncanny valley, this black hole of near reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star trek,"Star TrekHave you ever wondered what it would be like to fight a galactic battle in the middle of space?...Well now you can! I am of course talking about the highly popular TV programme that has recently been turned into a film, very popular amongst Sci-fi extremists. Although 'Star Trek' the TV series doesn't appeal to me, being a little bit to serious for me, the film gave me time away from everyday life to give me a space experience, however it did not convince me in to joining the Trekkie way. It opens with a tense space battle between captain Kirk and the evil aliens to gain revenge for future occurrences. At the time of the battle 'James T. Kirk' was in the middle of being born, while his heroic farther sacrifices his life for the good of the fleeing crew and his family. This plays into the Sci-fi genre by being set in space with aliens and high tech spaceships, comparing with 'Star Wars' which boosted the Sci-fi genres into public appeal. My review on this film is that if you are a Trekie or not a Trekie this film will appeal to you, although it is not a wow film, it will go down as one of the best Sci-fi movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Saved the franchise,"Let's be honest here, if this movie wasn't successful it might have been the end of the Star Trek franchise. The Deep Space, Enterprise and Voyager TV series didn't have enough of a fan base to support a feature film series of films. The original Star Trek crew and The Next Generation crew are both too old to really compete with current blockbusters. Even though the actors from the original Star Trek series are too old now the characters themselves were still very popular in syndication and replay of their movies. So starting over with them with younger actors in the roles is really the best way to go. Plus with them doing it where it's more of an alternate history instead of a reboot they can do new stories with them without having to worry about ruining the original Star Trek's lineage and poking holes in their stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The whole of the cast is fantastic, from Chris Pine to Zachary Quitno to Simon Pegg to Karl Urban...There isn't a character that is poorly written or unforgettable, and the way the characters are developed is just like a Star Trek Episode. The story and plot is exciting to book, featuring some phenomenal pacing and an epic finale. Star Trek is the new genre standard. Science Fiction films now have something to aspire to.

Star Trek...,"""Star Trek"" is a Sci - Fi movie in which we watch a man (James Kirk) who tries to live up to his father's legacy and also tries to save and fight for everything. We also watch a fight where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of it, and is the same legend which killed James Kirk's father.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which I found it very good but also for the direction of it which made by J.J. Abrams and it was equally good. In addition to this I have to say that the Visual Effects of this movie were spectacular and gave a really different view in the whole movie. I liked the interpretations of Chris Pine who played as James Kirk and he was very good at it and Eric Bana who played as Nero and he was equally good at it. In this point I also want to mention that I liked the appearance of the original Prime Spock, Leonard Nimoy and about the interpretation of Zachary Quinto who played as Spock I believe that inevitably I compared him with the original and I had a neutral opinion about him.Finally I believe that ""Star Trek"" is a great movie to watch and I am sure that you will like it very much. Also if you are a fan of Sci - Fi movies then I am definitely sure that you will love it. I strongly recommend it to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sensational return to the classic saga with a  young cast  and overwhelming special effects,"Excellent prequel to the splendid saga with a complex intrigue but following the canon and overemphasis on juvenile characterization and special effects . A new entry of the mythical saga of Star Trek directed by J. J. Abrams , the creator of ¨Mission impossible 3¨ and the successful series as ""Lost"" and ¨ Fringe¨ and many others ; here is developed the first meeting between the captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). Everything has been prepared for the maiden voyage of the entire crew in the aircraft more modern that has ever been made : ¨The Starship USS -1701 Enterprise¨ that ' boldly go where no man has gone before ' . His young crew has a fundamental objective : to find a manner to detain the nasty Romulano Nero (Eric Bana) who seeks revenge against Spock and threat to mankind . But the fate of the galaxy lays on the hands of two young rivals who were born in different planets . One of them, James Tiberius Kirk is a natural leader in search for a just cause . The another , Spock , who grew up in the world Vulcano, is a special character because of his part half human ( whose Vulvanian father is Ben Cross and human mother is Winona Ryder) , that makes it susceptible to instability on emotions . But Spock is also a brilliant and recent officer , while arrogant Kirk is a philander and roguish student . The crew of the USS is commanded by Captain Christopher Pike ( Bruce Greenwood lookalike role to Jeffrey Hunter ). There are also the Medical Officer , Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban in the role of DeForest Kelley); the man who will become the chief engineer of the Starship , Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (Simon Pegg in the role of James Doohan); the communications officer Uhura (Zoë Saldaña similar character to Michelle Nichols ), the experienced Sulu (John Cho substituting George Takei) and the young Chekov (Anton Yelchin in the role of Walter Koenig). All the classic personages taking on a dangerous first proof , confronting a terrible enemy Romulano named Nero and his hoodlums .This epic story is concentrated on characters as well as thrill-packed action and special effects although there're numerous of that too . The movie has tension, comedy , emotion, suspense and sensational spacial scenarios like is customary development of the franchise . Spectacular, exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new outing of Star Trek , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Idealism ,humor , humanity , several agreeable personages and trademark effects abound and will please the enthusiasts such as the neophyte .The top-notch acting convinces , especially the avenger Eric Bana in a super-villain role , Zachary Quinto, and the sympathetic Simon Pegg , while other players also make a nice work . And of course , special appearance of Leonard Nimoy in an emotive and intimate intervention. The stirring final amazing the spectator , in which the stirring and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . It is the rebirth of a saga, the start of a new scenario . Fans of the series may find much to love , but others will be bewildered and shocked by the romance between Spock and Uhura . Exceptional soundtrack by Michael Giacchino , he composes an impressive musical accompaniment to the film . Furthermore a colorful and evocative cinematography by Daniel Mindel . Suitable for family viewing , it's an entertaining adventure which young and old men will enjoy . Fans of the series will find very bemusing and fun . It is amusing to watch and Trekkies are sure to love it , resulting to be one of the best science-fiction prequels of all time .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I Dislike it...,"I will add that I am a star trek fan. Not a die hard one, but a star trek fan. I am also a hardcore fan of scifi...And here is where this movie hits in the wrong spot. It is an enjoyable movie. Had you called it, ""Let's Romp Through the Universe And Save It"" I probably would have given this movie a pretty high mark.BUT it's Star Trek, and I expected more. I expected a pushing of the envelope. Look at the early Star Trek movies, and series and what you get are topics that push people. Whether it be a ""colored"" person, a person that looks like Satan (Spock) or a robot that is intelligent (Data).Think about this one. We would not think twice about conversing with a robot and being friends with a robot. When STNG came out in 1987 we thought robots were things that you kept at arms length and to be wary of. Yet Star Trek changed that.What does this Star Trek movie do? NOT MUCH!!! Sure great movie, great effects, but that I can get from another movie.

Superb!,"I didn't even know about this movie, I had sort of read media about it, but I thought it was to be a series. Well, caught the movie on TV, seen it 5 times, it is extraordinary.

Every character is outlined or drawn with care and class, specially Bones and Spock, but everyone: Uhura (she had a thing for Spock!!!, great!!!), Scotty (there'd be whales in here captain!), Chekov (ver are di nucliar wessels?), Zulu (master navigator), make feel like a kid again. But yes oh yes, who could fill the shoes of the biggest captain ever?, wow, what a performance, Will Shatner must be proud, he made James T.

A franchise re-energised-big time!,"It's not an understatement to say that the news of a new Star Trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. Step forward J.J. Abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind TV series ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. Things were further eyebrow raising when Abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of Trekkies. Then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the Starfleet Academy and the coming together of what we know as the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. ""Ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""Kirk & Spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. Well not only did Abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most Trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. Budgeted at $140,000,000, Abrams Star Trek went on to gross Worldwide $384,953,778. Figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. I know I did.The success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although Abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. Sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, But Abrams and his writers (Roberto Orci /Alex Kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. They smartly link to Trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the Kobayashi Maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. This is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 Trek movie. There's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. All of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.Getting Leonard Nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. His presence keeps the all important essence of Star Trek within what is ultimately a reboot. It's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. The youngsters in the cast are impressive, Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and Zoe Saldaña (Uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. While Karl Urban (Bones McCoy) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. Villain duties falls to Eric Bana as Romulan Captain Nero, he's a touch miffed is Nero, and Bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. While Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.This U.S.S. Enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. It is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. The like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. Yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. A triumph from Abrams and his team - note the Stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema. Now comes perhaps a bigger challenge, the notoriously difficult second film... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I like it and hate it,"I have never been so confused about a movie before. Not the plot, but my feelings for it. First of all, I have been a fan of Star Trek since 1973, when I first saw the reruns. I read the books, build the models, etc. I enjoyed the show because of the stories, characters and technology. This movie, I enjoyed because of the characters. A new version of Kirk, a sort of new version of Spock, and McCoy are awesome. And for the most part, the rest of the cast were good too. Scotty needs some work, as does Chekov's accent. Sulu is good, and Uhura is hot but I will not say anything else about her for spoiler reasons(and the fact that I really hate what they did). But they were always rather minor characters in TOS anyway. The story makes sense most of the time, and sets up a new version of the Trek Universe which should be fun to explore. And the New Big E looks great, from the outside. But, the STYLE of the movie bothers me. From horrible set design(the ship looks like a refinery) to annoying lens flair, shaking cameras, and bad science. The interior views of the Enterprise just don't make sense, they would never fit into the ship and leave room for such things as crew quarters or science labs. The original and its sequels took great pains to make thing believable. This movie flushes those ideas down a very large water pipe. And why the lens flairs and shaky cameras? Sure they show a style, but the style sucks!! There are times when the entire frame is white! Are the CGI images so bad that you have to shake the camera to hide that fact? I am sure I will see this movie at least one more time. If for no other reason that to decide if I really like it, or I just enjoy it as a movie, and not Star Trek.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie moves at an almost breathtaking pace, with enough action to satisfy all. I enjoyed this movie more than any other entry except for First Contact.

It Was Time for Retooling (Retelling),"I got a great deal of enjoyment from this film. As one who watched the original in a dormitory TV room every Friday night, I have always embraced this canon, though I've never reached the lunatic fringe. Now that the original crew is either old, fat, or dead, I see nothing wrong with taking the characters and recasting them. If Basil Rathbone had been the only Holmes, we would never have had Jeremy Brett. I hope this sets up a future because there was nowhere to go with the originals (this is a fact of life called aging). The scenes of the founding of the relationships among the characters is nicely done. Those that criticize the look of the ship need to look what has happened here on earth in the last twenty years. Why should the bridge not change to become more true to the future as we can view it now? I thought the new characters found their individual ways. We forget that Kirk was always a bit of a loose cannon and we get to see why. Starship captains needed to have controlled recklessness to boldly go, as they say. The plot is up to the plots of the early series and all the bells and whistles complement this. The strength is the new characters.

"Visually stunning, but not a Star Trek","I have been looking forward to this since summer 2007 when is was released on IMDb that this EPIC prequel/reboot would be coming to our screens in 2009, yet it gets better still, to be directed by none other than J.J. Abrams (to fans of Lost, well hero.) So a bit on the film, now we (well all fans of ""Heroes"") were more that comfortable with JJ's choice for Mr Spock ""Zachary Quinto"" is an extremely accomplished young actor and seems to be turning in to none other that ""Philip H. Seymor"" not in the way of a lovable fat man but in the form of every thing this man gets his hands on is gold, one of the few up coming actors I look forward to watching in what I am sure is many future films.So that in true Bond stile leaves ""Kirk... James T. Kirk"" played by ""Chris Pine"" who to be honest we were all a bit nevus about. But to the surprise of many die hard ""William Shatner"" fans (also know as the Shatners) was more the willing to fill the boots of the extremely large prints left from previous leading roles from William and Patrick. Chris, he just fits in, perfectly it almost seems that he is the ""Daniel Crag"" to Star Trek.As we all know the above is only half of any action/SI-FI film the hart lay with the bad guy, to this film know as Nero (for those Star Wars fans out there the Emporia, Dath Vader, Dath Mall and Sir Alan Sugar all rolled in to one) played by Eric Bana who truly brings out the childhood boy inside us (you know, the out who pretends he hates big guns and sexy ladies in films but truly, he loves them) throughout his performance, the hairs on the back of the all the cinemas occupancies truly did stand up with the heroic trailer lie ""FIRE EVERYTHING.""The film really is art on a screen, in the way of the picture looks amazing. The film is shot, in most quite well, bar a few ""Michael Bay"" moments with a running, bouncing camera but that's what we get for to many people following the ways of the seeming God of film Quentin Tarantino (But back to the CGI.) I honestly don't know what else to say then it is extremely good I mean if you remember back to Spider-man 3 when we all saw the transformation of the Sandman for the first time and it was CGI at its best, I remember watching ""Jonathan Ross"" and he called that seen and I quote ""that is art, really CGI at its best"" it is the same with Star Trek, mouth watering picture the interior course of the film.So this film in short has a phenomenal cast, director and one bad ass baddie and some fantastic lines like ""FIRE EVERYTHING."" and from one Captain Christopher Pike to a future Captain James T. Kirk ""Your father was Captain for 12 minuets he saved 800 lives... I dare you to do better"" and there are many many more especially from ""Simon Pegg"" aka Scotty. So the question I have tried to ask and I guess am now asking you is, well ware did it all go wrong, its leaves you with the same feeling as Quantum of Solace amazing as your watching it but when its all over you realise that was it... it is over, ware was the climactic ending, then it hits you it was appalling the whole film was anticlimax, visually stunning but pointless. I believe JJ has tried so hard not to make this films ending all about the ""flash and boom"" and no story, witch I am all for but he seems to have forgot to add the ""flash and boom"" that is needed, it seems that the 2 hour film ends in seconds and there is no or hardly any epic Good vs. Evil fight that there is at any film (in some form.)Out of ten i am not to sure ware it would be, but some ware around the 6 mark. So my sad conclusion is that this film truly is visually stunning, just not at all what it could of been... it could of been a Star Trek.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brand New Beginning For Trekkies,"Let's face it, the last installment, ""Star Trek Nemesis"" (2002), was the last nail in the coffin of the tired sci-fi franchise. Since then, most Trekkies have kissed it goodbye. Now, however, J.J. Abrams has boldly taken the franchise back to where many other franchises have been before - into Reboot territory. With it, we have promises of more outer space capers with the 'new' USS Enterprise and its crew. And if that does not excite the legions of Trekkies all over the world, I don't know what will...This movie is an account of the birth of James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), his wild, rebellious childhood, his recruitment into the Starfleet Academy and his first trip on board the spanking new USS Enterprise under Capt Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Sure, we get to meet the other crew members, namely Spock (Zachary Quinto), troubled half-human, half-Vulcan, and members of his family; the reluctant doctor Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban); the sexy linguist Uhura (Zoe Saldana), the gungho Sulu (John Cho) and a 17-year-old Russian brain named Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Later, Scotty (Simon Pegg) comes aboard as chief engineer - and 'the gang's all here!' The villain is the vengeful Romulan Nero (played with gusto by Eric Bana) - and there are lots of twists and surprises. These include a love interest for the 'emotion-deficit' Spook and an appearance by a famous original member of the Star Trek cast.Director Abrams brings intelligence, inventiveness and definitely, a new beginning to the franchise. He is mindful of its traditions, its history and its nostalgic appeal - and he treats them with reverence. Together with his writers (Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) he fleshes out Gene Roddenberry's iconic young characters, including the USS Enterprise, and gives them a 'history'. As such, we get to sympathize with them.More importantly, he understands that the franchise is about fantasy and imagination - and he energizes the prequel with state-of-the-art special effects, thrills and stunts (from Industrial Light + Magic). Indeed, Abrams brings new meaning to the famous phrase ""Beam me up, Scotty!"" when Chekov does it when his subjects are in motion. Other wonders include a time-travel subplot but it is more confusing than awe-inspiring.However, it is the young and vibrant cast that help to make the movie work. Pine and Quinto (who plays Sylar on TV's ""Heroes"") are ideal as leads in this space opera - and the others like Urban, Saldana, Cho and Yelchin not only look like their original players, they also provide humor and a few laughs as well.It's time to boldly go back to the cinema for new Star Trek thrills, folks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Star Trek movie yet.,"This movie is excellent. In my opinion it is not only the best star trek movie, but the best star trek story made.As a fan of star trek i enjoyed the new story a lot, though some die hard fans might not like that it does not keep to canon. just so everyone knows, THIS MOVIE IS A SEPARATE CONTINUITY. If you a big Star Trek fan i think it helps to know that going into it.The action in the movie is non stop from start to finish. The cinematography is excellent and makes all the action seem even better.The casting for the characters is great and all of the characters portray their characters really well. I thought the chemistry between Kirk and Spock was especially good.I loved this movie and i really would love to see a sequel or a show based on this new storyline.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoy,"I had never seen Star Trek and due to the fame of the Star Wars franchise, I believed that it was a copy (sorry but I'm not a fan of movies of this genre), anyway, before seeing the movie I went looking for this universe, and I realized that Star Trek actually comes first and has a more realistic aspect, perceived in the characters (generally in the form of humans) and astronomical facts (Gravity, black hole, etc).This being the first movie I've seen in the franchise, I think it was a good introduction, it holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end, explains everything necessary to understand the story without leaving loose ends. Because it's less fanciful, it doesn't have a universe as vast and rich as Star Wars (at least that's my impression). In any case, it is an original work despite having a theme similar to Star Wars (interplanetary travel), as well as, a mafia movie will not necessarily be a copy of The Godfather.Soundtrack, special effects, costumes, performances are good according to what is expected of a film of this genre. The plot is not so deep (it doesn't make you reflect deeply on life situations) but it fulfills its purpose well, which is to entertain.Looking forward to watching the other movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Story and substance come second to a brave, brash and thoroughly accomplished rebooting of some old favourites.","The 2009 rebooting, re-envisaging of the Star Trek franchise drops us head first into its franchise's latest adventure - adventures often consisting of large groups of shrewd crew members commandeering grandiose, deep-space travelling vessels and getting into strife for our viewing pleasure. As if a dogfight between two spaceships wasn't enough to open a science fiction/action blockbuster, American director J.J. Abrams throws in a significant death, on top of an equally significant birth; a time travelling space ship ganging up on a ship half its size and a highly dramatic escape sequence. You can practically see the grin on the man's face as he unleashes this opening sequence onto fans of the franchise, who are likely stoked to the point of frenzy in the first place.If the general consensus was that the generation of Enterprise crew members whom followed that of the original crew, consisting of Kirk et al, were never quite of that standard in energy and engagement, and that the films of post-1991 followed a similar suite, then Abrams effectively blasts his way into a new era; new canon and new depictions of old favourites with this one, swooping opening movement at once encompassing just about everything you possibly could to open a reboot dramatically. In essence, the whole thing's gone ""Bond/Batman"" on us – the old crew are back for the first time since 1989, but the twist reads something like: most of the people playing them weren't even born at that time. This of course translates into the fact the crew of Kirk, Spock, etc. are in their youth and we follow their progress here from lowly kids on their respective planets to employees for the peaceful, respectful and reassuringly indomitable intergalactic organisation of StarFleet.That said, the film is almost frightened of formally taking on such an idea; the throwing in of a time travel-driven narrative calls to mind past ventures while a later scene actually dares to bring back one of the original crew in their older form. Likewise, and where people often cite Wrath of Khan as their favourite franchise instalment, this 2009 reboot dares to periodically invoke said film with its inclusion of mind slugs and that seemingly unbeatable examination we witnessed in ""Wrath's"" opening. In spite of all its bravado and slick visuals telling a rip-roaring yarn featuring incarnations of people we're fond of, it is quite extraordinary just how ordinary the film actually is. In spite of everything that arrives with it, and in spite of the fact it's difficult to watch it without a smile on one's face at the best of times, the film is painfully commonplace as a standalone work of filmmaking. There is an unshakable feeling that narrative and conflict came second to the primary focus of rebooting, something inherent in the relatively weak narrative idea that this crew of people must merely set out to save the world.When we begin proper, we do so way-back-when: far back enough for James T. Kirk to be a youth rebellious enough and spiteful enough to wreck his step father's car in what is an intuitive, brave and blasé response to a set-up; situation or person that grinds him. As Kirk grows a little older, he begins to resemble Chris Pine, who does a fantastic job in capturing the later mannerisms of Kirk – that odd, twitchy way in which he seemed to suppress nerves through stares and a brisk, sharp series of statements that cut to the heart of the matter. His renegade attitude from infancy carries over into young adulthood, his aggression and enthusiasm eventually channelled into joining StarFleet where he swaps the farms of Iowa for warzones set in deep space. Because everyone in the crew is still young, and the film is ultimately aimed at people of similar age, we get scenes set in bars; scenes of people haring down the roads in their automobiles to loud rock music and fleeting compositions of girls in their underwear during this juvenalised segment.The villain is a Romulan named Nero, played by Eric Bana – but he makes for a poor antagonist: a snarling, skin-headed, heavily tattooed bad guy drawn from stock and going on to remind you of just how good he was in playing a character of similar visual proportions, although much more rounded, in 2000's ""Chopper"". Nero's unhappy at what happened to his planet far into the future, that is to say its complete destruction at the hands of the Vulcans and the Humans – travelling back in time, his plan is to destroy Vulcan and Earth instead of using this time travelling technology to save the planet or try for some sort of compromise is weak, and emphasises how the attention towards the general rebooting trumped anything else. When Kirk does eventually assume control of a ship for the first time, we take note of the meek substance surrounding his channelling of the grief born out of the death of his father at the hands of the Romulans, and how this differs to Nero's attitude to it all. Aside from this, Kirk himself is on a bit of a black list with the StarFleet higher-ups when we witness him cheat at that commandeering test – the film coming to resemble a proving of sorts that he can, in fact, handle himself. But this is a start, a kick-starting of a fresh series of films based further still on old ground; a series with a first film here I enjoyed enough to want more, old ground of which I do not know as much about the essence as many-a others likely do that I still relish in re-treading anyway. The film has its flaws, and cannot quite match the quality of some of the preceding entries, but it is almost certainly worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As my customary farewell would seem oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck","From the opening scene through to the credits, this entry in the ""Star Trek"" franchise was worthy and well worth the wait. Rumours abounded and fan sites were a buzz with word that a new movie was on the making, the word was the movie was ""B"" grade and may not be worthy. How crazy joyous were we when we sat and watched as young versions of the original crew appeared and we were drawn into the plot.Crazy Australian (Erik Bana) plays Crazed Romulan bent on revenge. (I'm Aussie, .. yes he is crazy .. if only people from around the world could have seen him in such shows as ""Fast Forward or ""Eric""Young Kirk (Chris Pine) is as always unable to accept defeat.Spoke (Zachary Quinto) once again struggles with his human and Logical self.Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is sexier than ever! (Back in the 60's our jaws dropped at those short skirts)And Scotty (Simon Pegg) is busy giving her all she's got.And the rest of the regular bridge crew is there, Bones, Sulu and Chekov amuses once again with his accent.The movie draws from previous movies and the series to produce scenes and quotes to keep any trekkie delirious with delights.If your a trekkie, this entry will not fail you!Bring on the sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kirk And Spock In Their Salad Days,"Star Trek purists all over the universe are trashing this version of Star Trek and while I don't consider myself a purist as such, this one did not leave me yearning for more.This version has the classic characters that have become so identified with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy played by young actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. We see them as children, in the case of Kirk at the moment of his birth, and then growing up into top flight cadets at Starfleet Academy. But there's no hint of the camaraderie that we remember from the television series or the films.Young Kirk is a rebel and we don't know if he'll ever be any good. Far cry from the disciplined starship captain we know. Spock is pretty much the character we do remember, he is a younger version of Leonard Nimoy. The others are all there as younger versions of themselves.Now as we're going through the film, purists will spot the many flaws in the saga we've seen develop. But that is later explained when we know the true nature of the villain that the Enterprise is pursuing. That would be Eric Bana a time traveling Romulan who's got a doomsday weapon and he's going to wipe out a lot of history as we've learned it.He alters quite a bit of it so if new films are made and they are planned, the Trekkies will have to get used to a whole new dynamic. One change that was for the better, it was nice to see Zoe Saldana as a young Uhura get around and actually have a life beyond opening hailing frequencies.The science seems flawed and I suppose we'll have to wait to get into the Star Trek century before we can get a clue if what happens in this film could actually happen. But I do wish they'd given the new Kirk and Spock a better introductory story because now they're stuck in those parameters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Write This As A Star Trek Virgin...,"I have never in my life watched Star Trek...until now. I heard from a friend who was in living the same Trek-less life I was that the movie was great. So I went to my local video store and grabbed Star Trek on blu-ray due to the lack of anything else catching my attention. I figured I'd give it a go, but never expected to like it.But to my surprise, I loved it! I am the farthest thing from a Trekkie, believe me, but there were a few pop culture references even the biggest Star Trek virgin picked up on! From beginning to end I was completely entertained. The story, characters, and graphics of the film made me feel as if I was on the USS Enterprise with all of the cadets. I was completely engrossed, I simply couldn't take my eyes off of my TV.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were phenomenal. Their dynamic, I feel is what kept me so interested. I don't know what their dynamic was on the television show or movies before this, but if it's always been this entertaining, I may start getting into Trek...hey, better late then never! This film had a perfect balance of comedy, drama, suspense, thrills, and so on and so forth. What an amazing cinematic experience! I recommend this film to any and everyone who enjoys an all around good movie! It had everything in it without feeling too overdone or crowded. I rarely purchase films unless I know it is worth it and has rewatchability, but I do believe I will be making a trip to my local Walmart and buying the Blu-Ray this evening.......See you don't have to know or like anything about the original Star Trek to thoroughly enjoy this movie!

Plot fails to reach escape velocity,"When I first heard Sylar would become Spock, I was already keen to see this movie. And it is indeed a very sticky bit of popcorn - a tasty snack with no food value at all.One of the strange beauties of this film is that it will certainly fail as a DVD seller because the plot is execrable. As an entertainment device, it holds up for an hour or so - but it could not possibly survive multiple viewings. Quite an inversion from the norm.Most science fiction is a crucible for social politics, and this alternate Star Trek fares well here. Beyond the great visuals and jaunty dialogue, selected characters have a vague inner life and back story. The original Trek cannon is adhered to on occasion, and this provides some backbone though by the end of the film even Salman Rushdie would be seeking less magic realism.Due to the pure entertainment value the film delivers, this will probably spawn a franchise - but only if the plot is not taken from scrawlings on the lavatory at Walmart.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still living long and prosperously,"Cocktail party chat on Mission Impossible III might, at very worst, label you mainstream. But mention 'trekkie' interests and the ghetto of a solitary corner awaits, as you vainly gaze across the watered-down punch for a glimmer of like-minded weirdos.Unless pointy ears and anoraks are your thing, admitting you go to the latest Star Trek movie was generally a mistake. This, the studios, in the name of all that is financially Good and Great, wish to save us from. Star Trek must be lifted from its intergalactic backwater and placed squarely in the multi-million dollar sound-bite. Now, suitably high-concept, this eleventh incarnation from the media franchise becomes the respectable selection from a dizzying array of multiplex excess.What Christopher Nolan (and then Heath Ledger) did for Batman, surely a blank cheque and a few good actors can do for Captain Kirk and his motley crew. That, at least, seems the intention. How well does it pan out?Our new Star Trek has a less cult muppets and more action heroes. Chris Pine almost morphs the face of William Shatner's original and the captain of the 4th TV series. Leonard Nimoy cameos as aging Spock as we are introduced to the newer model. Simon Pegg (Scotty), Winona Ryder (Spock's mum) and Zoe Saldana (Uhuru) are all a joy to watch.To establish itself as authoritative (a la Batman Begins), this movie is the prequel, long ago envisaged by creator Gene Roddenberry, and cancelled after its premature birth in the ham-fisted TV 'Enterprise' series. We follow Kirk from his earliest days, and also see young Spock grow up. It is an enormous balancing act, executed with a tremendous price tag (more than any previous Star Trek film) and has to tick many boxes for die-hard fans as well as reaching out to new audiences.Our film opens a few minutes before Kirk is born. During a massive battle, he is shuttled out of harm's way, a cacophony of explosions submerged by sympathetic orchestra strains. He grows up the pretty boy-next-door with a wild streak. A sort of James Dean with a brain. Or, ""the only genius repeat-offender in the Mid-West."" After the most taxing training that Hollywood can devise, he becomes a hardened fighter still in touch with his humanity.There are nice touches to look out for. Spock becomes 'emotionally compromised.' We see passion and a moist eye from the lovely Uhuru; and futurescapes glimpsed all too briefly in an average shot length of under five seconds.As summer blockbusters go, Star Trek deserves to do well. But I would like to have seen some of the groundbreaking moral subtlety for which the original series – famed for the first on screen inter-racial kiss – garnered high regard among many. One has to search for any underlying dynamic at all. At best, it is the story of brave and fearless white Americans – with the addition of a Russian, a Scot, and a token black woman – facing a terrorist-style enemy (rogue Romulans) that has an unfounded grudge, formidable strike power, and no logical way of being defeated. (Wow! That's not too hard to follow!) Add familiar tropes about saving mankind, and western 'compassion' (before blowing someone up). Then fights between representatives of good and evil on a high ledge somewhere, and it starts looking depressingly derivative. Star Trek here relies on action scenes styled to Tom Cruise completing another impossible mission. But, sadly, Pine lacks Cruise charisma – or anyone else's for that matter. And, while MI-III director Abrams was probably a wise choice, the result is more a step in the right direction than a satisfying overall product.We can unashamedly leave our pointy bits at home to watch this film in the company of regular cinema-goers. But, rather than ground-breaking fare, it only takes us to the happy-land of unthinking entertainment. Its catchline: 'The Future Begins' came up on the screen only moments after the trailer for the new Terminator, for which I am assured, 'The End Begins.' Seems all you need these days to defeat an undefeatable assassin is a good starter line. May the White House take note. Though not, perhaps, feeling impelled to boldly go too boldly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It's loud, got a lotta explosions and CGI, if you like that sort of thing...","Honestly, I got a headache fairly early in the film and ended up leaving during the final half-hour.Just way, way too loud for me so it was like being at a Creed concert but I don't like Creed. Maybe they had a good laser show, and smoke and lots of hot women in the audience, but still, the music stank. In a situation like that I would also get a headache. Not sure which would be worse, Creed or Star Trek. Hmmmm...Star Trek had lot's of lens flares. If you like lens flares you may like Star Trek. Depends on what you're looking for in a movie, I guess...On the plus side, it was very loud and had a lot of CGI and no JarJar Binks. The plot was ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional.

To boldly go,"JJ Abrams and his creative team with added lens flare have rebooted the Star Trek films and gone off to another timeline.This preserves the stories of the earlier Star Trek adventures and its sequel shows but allows Abrams to concentrate on new stories a younger crew of the Enterprise. That was the plan with Star Trek. Unfortunately it all went awry immediately with the sequels.However here we see the adventures of the younger James T Kirk, a rather wayward young man encountering Spock, Sulu, Scott and Bones as well as other crew members.The writers have created conflict between Kirk and Spock as the Vulcan is unhappy with Kirk's breach of ethics and later after Spock's planet his destroyed, Kirk's inability to follow orders as Spock kicks him off the Enterprise which leads Kirk to meet the older, alternative Spock.The plot is a renegade Romulan attacking Federation ships, who might be from another time and his anger is focussed on Spock.

Good Movie... If you can actually See it,"I went to the Ultra Screen because I wanted to get the most out of this movie. I enjoyed the storyline, the characters were awesome. The special effects from what I could tell, were pretty cool. THIS is my only problem. I would have enjoyed this movie, possibly enough to actually buy it. BUT, I guess the latest thing in movies, to add to drama in suspense, is to make the camera as shaky as possible. During fight scenes chases, any type of action, it's very hard to follow with what is going on when all you see is blurriness. So I became VERY frustrated! I don't need someone to tell me that the moment is intense by shaking the camera to the point i can't tell whats going on anymore. That's like someone showing me an intense photograph, of like someone jumping from a building, but then they start shaking the photograph in front of me, I can no longer see the detail, and my brain can no longer register the photo.

Satisfying Star Trek,"You never know how a movie will come out especially with all the hype and nonsense used to pitch it in the most positive light strictly for financial gain and reasons.

This movie has successfully given movie lovers a good believable story on the origins of it all plus a great story to introduce the chemistry which is so important in the Trek world. If we are to believe that Captain Kirk and the crew are going to explore the never-ending Universe and all its mysteries then a talented and extra-ordinary crew is mandatory. Here, with minor exceptions we have one. Personalities are captured of all the veteran actors and we the fans remain content. We watch how the start-up of this group comes from different backgrounds and then develops into a cohesiveness that brings us current to the beloved original series we have come to know and appreciate. Its nice going back to the younger years and watching them gel. I was having to much fun to want to become critical of the movie and was tempted but quickly was brought back because of the excellent directing and thrilling story unfolding at a rate that defies any negative commenting to take place.

"Not bold, not uncharted.  Missing thrusters.","At some point many years ago, big budget summer films became devoted to the central theme of the Earth's destruction. This is now ubiquitous. Look at the summer lineup. Angels and Demons, Transformers 2, Terminator: Salvation, even the documentary ""Earth"". Usually there is a device that the bad guys want to obtain that can destroy the planet. The villain is of course mad, and wants revenge for some transgression we're about to have explained to us. Nearly everything follows the ""Paradise Lost"" mould that Wrath of Khan used so well.Screenwriters don't seem to understand that the scale of vengeance doesn't have to be so massive to be effective, to create tension. Its about the two rivals in an opposition of mind and spirit, playing chess like warring titans, leveling mountains in their path. A nemesis might know everything that a lover knows, all of the vulnerabilities, only they're willing to cross the line and twist the knife, and say ""I told you so"". Eliminating this as a plot element makes the story mechanical. Who cares if the world is at stake if every soul in it is generic? Show me one soul worth caring about, and I'll teeter on the brink of my seat.The actors in this seem to have been chosen because of their intrinsic youthfulness. Its almost the kind of stylization you'd find in Japanese manga, with the characters in younger form having bigger, more expressive eyes. No wonder that the story shows the new Kirk being delivered by a creature with larger than life eyes.Everything is dialed up for the MTV crowd. Instead of the minimalist camera movement in the original films, there's a lot of orbiting and rotation around the characters. Everything is done to indicate that this is a modern action film, with average values.To really deliver the point that we're in alien locations, the angles are more obtuse, even the lenses are fish-eye at times. Kirk drives a motorcycle, is basically Matt Damon as Good Will Hunting trying to become Buck Rogers. He gets into fights in loud bars, boozes up, and gets lippy with authority figures who try to drag him out of his loser lifestyle. Because of his latent Hero Gene, and nothing more, he ascends to greatness.The writing only aspires to pantomime the original cast using recognizable phrases and plot elements. It doesn't expand the mythos, it just plays off of what the average fan will probably remember. No chances taken, and so its like patrolling the Galaxy in a pontoon boat, remembering a world so far away it must have happened in an alternate universe, where screenwriters had vision, and directors had balls.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This IS Star Trek,"I thought I would give a quick review regarding the people who say ""it's a great movie but it isn't Star Trek"". While I wouldn't call myself a trekkie (more a sci fi nerd) I can honestly say I have seen every incarnation of Trek to date, every episode, every movie... MMM, maybe I am a trekkie (Though I DO NOT own a uniform!). Gene Rodenberry's vision of Star Trek changed and evolved throughout the various series, so I am going to concentrate on one - Star Trek the original series, not the films with the original crew, the ORIGINAL series (TOS). I still watch TOS today and while later incarnations were more polished and had very credible sci tech and science babble in them, TOS was about the adventure, the relationships between the crew especially between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. They didn't care if the story wouldn't stand up scientifically they were morality plays with friendship at their heart. THIS is what the 2009 incarnation is all about. It isn't like the films with the original crew or the Next Gen or Voyager, but if you honestly sit down and watch the TOS, it is quite a different animal. I think this film is better for that. I once read that Rodenberry was asked what he would like to see for the future of Star Trek and he said he would like to see some bright young thing do it bigger and bolder than he ever could..... Nuff said!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You couldn't ask for a better reboot,"I've been having to think about this for quite a while. People have been getting on my case about me thinking this is one of the best Star Trek films in the entire series(It's right up there with Wrath of Khan in my opinion). I've had more than enough time to think about this, and I think the best answer that I can give is that because of the scope of the story, the grand, epic scale and nature and the characters involved, this picture is big. It's almost too big to be a movie.The science doesn't bother me. The details don't bug me because in my opinion they don't really detract from the story or bring up a way in which the crew could have stopped Nero. Talking of Nero, people have been demanding to know his motivations. I will keep insisting to you until the day I die that sometimes people do stupid, psychotic, evil and massively, mind-blowingly irresponsible things for reasons far beyond us. They do that in the real world too, and it certainly isn't improbable they wouldn't use whatever means at their disposal to reek revenge, no matter how crazy it may seem.What matters is that there is a threat to every federation planet, and Kirk must not just deal with Spock, but he must come to terms with himself and realize he can't be a selfish jackass anymore, he has to step up and do what is right not for himself but for everyone. It's nice to see after all the conflict Spock and Kirk went through that their legendary friendship is beginning to blossom.It was nice to have Spock prime there for a reason. His being there wasn't a result of being shoe-horned, but as a result of actual dramatic necessity. Spock Prime is there for a reason, and I honestly don't know if he will or how he will aid the Spock and Kirk of the past, we'll just have to wait and see.What matters is that the story is big, it's fast-paced, it's never boring, there's always something going on. From the minute Kirk's father charges heroically to save hundreds of lives from Nero as he says goodbye to his wife and newly born child, you're emotionally invested. You know who this little boy is going to grow up to be.This movie is a game changer. It takes the crew of the great original series and gives them a new lease on life with potentially endless stories that will no doubt thrill and excite us all. I just hope the writers can keep up this frantic pace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great,"I Loved ""Bones"" in this movie, he played the doctor perfectly. I enjoyed the storyline and it helped make sense of things that I remember as a young child until now. I saw the Trek movies from the 80's......it played off to these characters beautifully.I agree with the person that gave his comment first...... they picked the right people to play the main characters. I also liked who they picked to play Scottie...... it was just Great all around and I give great admiration and applause to those that made the movie work......It is great to see how a franchise such as this can still carry itself after 40 years..... and it Works. Thank You for a Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Star Trek, Resurrected","I sit and ponder as I read other reviews, knowing in this world everyone is entitled to their opinion concerning one thing or another, but I have drawn the conclusion that we have abused what was meant to be a privilege and not a right. For some unforeseen reason it was transformed into a right and has become grossly abused. I consider myself to be a advent Star Trek fan, and after watching what I believe to be a very successful movie, the final analysis is the J.J. has resurrected a franchise that seem to have lost its swagger and energy, we have seen many TV shows and 2 generation of Star Trek crews in movies, and for some reason we were left feeling empty, but this movie completely fills that void. The movie plot was Gene Roddenberry all the way, Star Trek is Sci-fi, therefore the plot must have a few tablespoons of absurdity mixed in, the action sequences, the dialogue is Star Trek. Start to finish I believe this team put together by J.J did a great job resurrecting what I believe was a dying franchise which had years of success. This new cast bought the swagger and energy back, truly Star Trek has been Resurrected, now let us set a course for more success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still holds up,"10 years later, I've rewatched this and it still holds up as a great movie.

A Trek Movie For Today's Audience,"I know very few people are going to read this, but I have to review this one movie.This is the one movie that I walked around for two years waiting to see. I wasn't disappointed--not only did it stay true to the Star Trek spirit; it did so in a way that I think a great deal of modern audiences will be able to enjoy.I thought the cast chemistry was good, and I found each of the movie's new characters just as interesting as those that have been around for the past forty-four years.While I must admit that it's not as good as some of the other Trek movies, most notably the Wrath of Khan, I would recommend this one to anybody.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie gets worse for me with each rewatching,"When it first came out I was bright eyed and excited for what this could mean for the franchise. But then the years went by and reality took it's toll. I am no longer the naive child I once was, JJ Abrams has seen to that.This is what I would consider an EXCELLENT science fiction/action movie. It has splosions, is well polished and fast paced with enough character development anyone who is not familiar with Star Trek could get into. However this is completely TRASH Star Trek. Why bother retelling the same story over, they could have done what previous movies and shows did, pick a point in the already established timeline and create something new. But instead they go over the same story that has been done already... then added in a time travel storyline... as if the writing wasn't lazy enough.I would recommend this to anyone wanting some good sci-fi action but would warn Trekkies to skip it, not much here worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Second time viewing,"Having watched Start Trek second time round after a two-year pause, this time prefaced by Abrahams himself explaining his own unique ""twist"" of the Roddenberry saga I feel, as lifelong fan of the Star Trek series to add some constructive but positive comments. It must be mainly a preserve of the male sex in that we sometimes long for dreams from which we never have to awaken. My emotions in identifying with the characters I had literally grown up with were ones of blissful reassurance. The five main characters they had somehow been plucked from the multitude to resemble the previous ones right down to the peculiar mannerisms that entranced and entertained us during on those cathode ray tube 70s days. I think the plot would not have been as plausible without other Hollywood blockbusters such as the Back-To trilogy that had preceded it to prepare and mollify our perceptions as to the implications of the space/time paradox. I think the reality of the situation by the end of the movie had just about dawned upon me - that there was no going back, and that the reality of the ""new future"" and follow-on movies would start from this ""Idée fixe"". I really loved the suspense and the swashbuckling antics of Chris Pines' new Kirk. Undeniably the best movie of 2009.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good,"If you expect this to be like the cheesy tv series in the past, you would be totally mistaken.

From a Life long Fan....one hell of a movie,"I was raised on Star Trek, all of them, there isn't a movie or series I didn't like. Setting aside the fact that there were some big changes made to the continuity this movie delivered. The changes are made for a reason and explained within the show.The cast was fantastic, Quinto and Urban were dead on in their performances and Chris Pine was (in my opinion) better than William Shatner. Ben Cross as Sarek...no one can replace Mark Lenard but he was trying his best. The way Mr. Abrams filmed it and how it was written just added to the excellence.The music was original except of course the end and fit the film to a tee. There's drama, action, and comedy all woven into a great script, acted and filmed very well.You don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie, it speaks for itself and I highly recommend that you see it. 10/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The more I think of this movie, the more I drop my rating...","If you are a fan of the original Star Trek, there is very little of it here. The character development gives a completely different take on the crew's origins. I did not like the new twists on everyone's background. Very poorly acted too, but I did enjoy Zoe Saldana. There is also a plot element to explain why everything is different. Plot-wise, not an enjoyable story.The only two highlights of the film for me was Leonard Nimoy and the look of the Enterprise. But they made the ship look too high tech. It looks like it could run circles around the Enterprise D. Even though a lot of the humor was corny, I did chuckle at most of the jokes.Very visual movie, but I did not care for the new direction of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Brilliant!,"I grew up with the original Star Trek - Jim Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty etc, were all part of my childhood – so I approached this remake with some trepidation.I absolutely loved it! The casting was pretty much spot on, there were some goofs (such as Mr Chekov) but they were easily forgiven. The story line was quite clever allowing the original series and this new series to co-exist using the same characters.The special effects and action scenes are as you would expect for the 21st Century – fast paced, brilliantly executed and edge-of–your seat. You were into the thick of the action from the start but there was sufficient time for good character development and storyline.If this is the beginning of a new series of Star Trek then all I can say is ""Live long and prosper"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Star Trek': The Prequel,"While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.'Star Trek' (2009) is neither one of the best of the films or one of the worst, if anything it's another in-between effort while being marginally better than the other two in-between films. There are a lot of impressive elements and some major flaws that stop it from being the great prequel that it had potential to be.Visually, the film mostly looks great. Particularly good is the set for the Enterprise which not only amazes visually but one of the elements that sticks close to the original series. The special effects are mainly fantastic and leave one in awe, while there is audacious and suitably moody cinematography and atmospheric lighting. By all means it is not perfect visually, there is the distracting overuse of lens flares that was in serious need of a toning down, it was a technique that was abused somewhat, didn't feel necessary in some scenes and is not particularly comfortable sometimes to look at.Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.There are some thought-provoking moments in the script and it doesn't feel too talky which is true in spirit to the original series. Where it doesn't fare so well is the comic relief, there is a little too much of it and some of it wasn't particularly funny and seemed superfluous as well.Regarding the story, 'Star Trek' (2009) evoked mixed reactions from me. It is rich in atmosphere and has some thrilling moments and truly exciting action, while the interplay between Kirk and Spock is brilliantly written and makes one feel quite nostalgic. Most of it is easy to follow. Less good are some bogus science, some parts that are convoluted and could have benefited from more explanation and Nero's plan and motivation being underdeveloped, confused and inconsistent. It is also too big and noisy in spectacle and could have quietened down to give room for more characterisation. One of the original series' strengths too was the characters and how they were developed and interacted, other than Kirk, McCoy and Spock there wasn't enough of that with most of them like Nero being far too one-dimensional.Casting is mostly good but with a couple of misses. Zachary Quinto in particular nails it as Spock with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Another great contribution is a suitably cantankerous Karl Urban, who remains loyal to DeForrest Kelley's interpretation without being an impersonation. Chris Pine did very well and is certainly more subtle than William Shatner, the character isn't likable at first but evolves and Pine brings that out. Zoe Saldana is fiery and sexy and Bruce Greenwood is good fun. It was nice to see Nimoy again as Old Spock and brought a nostalgic and affectionate element. Bana has some menace and does his best, but there are admittedly far more interesting villains in other 'Star Trek' films.Not everybody works. Simon Pegg, who is usually a very entertaining guy, is beyond irritating comic relief with Scotty coming over as a caricature. Anton Yelchin has also given much better performances, he badly overdoes it as Chekhov.In conclusion, fun and impressive often but with some major flaws at the same time. Nothing comes over disastrously though. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Favourite Film in Space,"Not Kidding. It is just so refreshing to see a film with this scale of action have dialog this excellent. We hear none of them saying'I gotta get me one of those' or 'My Bad'They're all so smart on the enterprise, smarter than anyone in the audience and so enormous faith is given (well at least by me)The acting was perfect, casting perfect, direction FANTASTIC. That shaky camera brought a reality to it, and the characters are never sacrificed.The story also has, to me, a sort of art-house quality interjected in it, with the red matter changing the way things are, and the film beginning in a wonderful demanding fascinating way.I own the DVD and whenever I hear the theme music playing I get absolutely thrilled, something I'm still feeling after all these times watching the film. I think it's safe to say J.J Abrams is a tremendous talent who has made me a Trekkie to boot, I'm sure I'm not alone.I wanna know more about the Star Trek universe, but only with these actors playing the characters.....BRING ON THE SEQUEL!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable even for non trekkies,"I'd like to start off this review by saying I am not a fan of the Star Trek franchise and never have been. I have seen random episodes of several of the many series carrying the title, but was never really grasped by any of the series. Other than knowing the names of the iconic crew members such as Captain Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Uhura etc. I do not posses much knowledge of the history of Star Trek. Having said that, I went into this movie with little to no expectations, which may explain why I could find few faults with this movie. I enjoyed the plot and although the transition of Kirk from simple cadet to captain felt a little rushed, it did not hurt the storyline in my opinion.I can imagine that fans of the Star Trek franchise might have more trouble with this movie due to possible inaccuracies when compared to ""actual"" history from the series. However as I stated I am not one of these fans, and judging by the scores the movie received in several reviews I read, I will take the liberty to assume that both hardcore fans and newcomers enjoyed this movie for what it was as I did.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi movie every now and then, not only to Star Trek fans and I believe it has what it takes to draw younger generations to the Star Trek franchise, and consider it a worthy reboot.7/10 - Good for what it is, not looking at possible inaccuracies when compared to the original series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek makes sci-fi exciting and fun again,"This long awaited and anticipated movie is absolutely terrific fun whether you are a Star Trek fan or not. Rarely have I seen a two hour movie that packs so much in and sprints along at such a frenetic pace.All the new cast were superb (with the possible exception of Simon Pegg who may have misjudged his performance but who we see very little of). Pine and Quinto playing Kirk and Spock totally nail it - really believable while bringing new aspects and their own interpretations to the characters. Carl Urban who plays Bones McCoy is truly superb too as is Zoe Saldana as Uhuru.This is really a character driven movie, and the Romulan bad guys are secondary to that - the real pleasure is in seeing the new crew get to know each other, interact and master the brand new ""original"" Enterprise. (The love affair interest is cleverly and deftly handled too).The effects are phenomenal, and because this is a relatively unknown cast who aren't swallowing up 50% of the budget on their wages, all the money is up there on screen.It isn't perfect, but it is hard to see how this could have been done much better. JJ Abrahams has accomplished the near impossible - a new invigorated Star Trek that has universal appeal.If you have illogical prejudices against Star Trek or Sci-Fi and don't see this you are really missing out.This is how to reboot a franchise - this is just way better than the Star Wars prequels.

Hyper and Too Slick For Its Own Good,"I know people have said that they didn't want a retread but what's wrong with sticking with what works? This movie is so desperate to modernize the legend that it loses its soul along the way. Is putting a slick, 21st century character spin on these characters worth putting up with what's lost in the translation? The movie is slick and hyper but it's not very good. Are a few good explosions worth wasting 120 minutes of time? For me, the answer is a resounding ""No!"" There are far better ways to spend your movie money than this too slick for its own good movie represented by JJ Abrams's latest endeavor. Putting aside the hamfisted plot (which is unevenly awful), all that's left is a woefully underwritten motion picture that starts off interesting enough but is smothered under each hyper and slick scene until all you have is a film that gets smothered under its own attempt at being slick.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Strong visuals but low on story carbs,"The Star Trek reboot delivers on the visual level. Stunning images, slick set design and pretty actors put a polish on Roddenberry's universe that hasn't been seen since Star Trek: The motion picture took the show to the big screen.However, behind the facade lurks simplicity. Lightning fast cuts and blur may be state of the art in the editing room but they also try to create excitement where the story just barely holds up to TV show standards and not at all to some after-screening scrutiny over drinks.Success is quite likely and the seeds for a new franchise are sown, if with a heavy hand - after all that's what a reboot is about.

Would it make a difference if I say don't watch it?,"It is a decent sci-fi movie - not a very good star trek movie. It feels like an extended episode of the series, and you'd think - oh well - I'll wait for next week's episode which hopefully will be better than this week's uncommonly uninspired one. The hic however is that this is not an episode - it's supposed to be a blockbuster movie. The special effects - granted are up to standards for a movie which involved astronomical sums of money in its making.The plot unfortunately resembles too much the usual ephemeral blockbuster in the box office which normally lasts a short burst up the charts and fades away very quickly. It is good fun but you tend to forget about the movie as soon as you leave the pictures. About the story itself ... why bother ... not much to say except that you've got people coming from the future trying to rectify things in the present. No wait!

Crowd-pleasing fun,"Star Trek is the best movie of the summer so far. While I'm no Trekkie, I was able to appreciate the delicate balance between making an summer-adrenaline movie with an attractive young cast while staying true to spirit of the original series. J.J. Abrhams has, in effect, done for Star Trek what Christopher Nolan did for Batman: get rid of the cheesy elements that made the series a laughing-stock while drawing out the raw power of the core themes and characters. Just like Nolan, Abrams has allowed the nerds to say to the mainstream public: ""See? That's why we're so into this!""The story is good and the jokes hit the mark about 80% of the time, but the cast is where it's at. Chris Pine is makes for an entertainingly arrogant Kirk, and Heroes' Zachary Quinto is fine as Spock, but I'm all about the supporting cast, especially Zoe Saldana's strong Uhura, Karl Urban's (The Lord of the Rings) surprisingly funny take on Bones McCoy, and the pies de resistance, Simon Pegg, underused but awesome, as Scotty. If you've seen Shaun of the Dead and/or Hot Fuzz, you know Simon Pegg is the shiz. The Leonard Nimoy cameo is perfect, the action thrilling. My grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good job, J.J. Abrams! Great STAR TREK reboot ever.","The 2009 STAR TREK reboot is amazing and J.J. Abrams did a very good job with this movie and I like it.The story of the 2009 reboot follows James T. Kirk and Spock aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero, a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The story also takes place in alternate reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock.The alternate timeline was created in an effort to free the film and the franchise established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving the original story elements.The film is directed by J.J. Abrams (who also produced Cloverfield, directed it's sequel, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, Mission Impossible III and the upcoming seventh STAR WARS film saga, EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS) with a screenplay written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fringe, The Legend of Zorro, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Cowboys and Aliens, Mission: Impossible III) and they really did a good job with a good screenplay and direction.I love this story and even though I have seen only three of the films, STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK, STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER, I did not know what STAR TREK was, but I knew what STAR WARS was and it was really fantastic.So, I had the guts to watch this movie and I thought I would end up saying, ""What in the hell did I just watch?"", but after it ended, I said ""That was fantastic. I hope there is a sequel to this movie someday."" and there is. I will watch the sequel and then I will review it.The character development and storyline were really amazing and fantastic and extraordinary, man. It is just amazing and fantastic to see this movie last year in 2014 on FXX and I recorded it from my DVR and watched it and thought it was cool.Chris Pine plays James Kirk and he is amazing, as well as Zachary Quinto playing Spock, the younger version and the late Leonard Nimoy as Prime Spock. Eric Bana plays the villain Nero wonderfully. The rest of the cast that includes John Cho as Sulu, Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek, Bruce Greenwood as Admiral Pike, Simon Pegg as Scotty, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov, Winona Ryder as Spock's mother and Zoe Saldana as Uhura all deliver great performances and there are some minor appearances by the film as well.Chris Hemsworth, yes, Thor is in this movie as Kirk's dad, George Kirk, Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's mother, Winona Kirk, Rachel Nichols as Gaila, Deep Roy as Scotty's assistant and Tyler Perry as the head of Starfleet Academy, Admiral Richard Barnett and they all do a really good job.The visual effects, sound design and makeup are really amazing in this film and I am surprised that the make-up won an Oscar at the 82nd Academy Awards. The film is well shot and I give credit to Daniel Mindel, who does a good job in this film. The music by Michael Giacchino was really cool and I liked his musical scores for Super 8, The Incredibles and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which I reviewed also on here.This movie really deserved that critical acclaim and the critics took this movie really seriously, but also said that this film polarized some Star Trek fans and this film is just amazing in every way.STAR TREK gets a 10 out 10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great start to rebooted Star Trek movies,"When Leonard Nimoy passed away this week, I thought it time to catch some of his last Star Trek appearances. The Star Trek movie 2009 does not disappoint.If you are a fan of the original series, you will love how this movie brings in many of the qualities of the original. Kirk as a brash, no- holds-barred kid who fears nothing. Spock battling his biracial status. Bones with his country doctorness. Checkov not being understood by the computer because of his accent. Sulu sword fighting. Scotty being able to do anything and laugh about it. But Uhura being ultra sexy and manning up to Spock - that was just great.The evil Nero as the nemesis, and what he does, is incredible. The movie moves fast and furious as this space ship from the future comes to destroy the past. Common theme, with a great twist around Spock and Vulcan.Love the action. Love the ending how Kirk and Spock conspire and like in the originals, split second timing saves the day. When the bad guy gets his due, you will cheer when Kirk says - You got it.It's an enjoyable fast-paced movie that will have you cheering and leave you wanting more.

"Good guys win, bad guy looses and the special effects are great.  But it's not really Star Trek.","I am a trekker/trekkie. I have been all my life. And I wanted to love this movie. I really wanted this movie to re-boot the franchise so that I could continue to have new Star Trek movies to watch. Even after I first saw this movie, the day it was released, I was trying to tell myself that I loved it. I tried to excuse it for all its blockbuster simplicity and its lack of depth. But in the end I honestly felt like ""Armageddon"" had been remade with characters with Star Trek names. While it was a good action flick, even an excellent action flick, it just was not Star Trek.The best Star Trek always asked questions. It always presented difficult social questions in a way that people could see them for what they were, without throwing them in their faces with platitudes and slogans. I remember the presentation of torture in the ""Chain of Command"" episode of the Next Generation. I remember the Voyager episode ""Prey"" asking questions about the sanctity of all life. And almost every episode of the original series asked very important social questions.And there were the science elements of the fiction in Star Trek. The communicator became the cell phone of today. The Army is working on a real phaser (PHASR - with stun). And many of the ideas in the episodes were inspirational to real scientists (there is a real theory for warp drive in physics today).So, what did the new movie give us: Red Matter and the importance of teamwork . . .In the end I can't bring myself to consider this real Star Trek. It's a blockbuster action movie, and a good one, but it doesn't wrestle with serious issues, it doesn't play with scientific ideas, it really doesn't make you think at all. It's just a shoot-em-up where the good guys win, bad guy looses and the special effects are great. But it's not really Star Trek.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
97-th on 250 list!?Is this a joke?,"I went to see Star Trek the first day it came to cinemas and i can't say it was a bad movie but i can't say it was a good one either.There are so many sf movies that are much better than this one an that didn't get not even as close of attention that this one did.Star Trek is an average movie that could be a lot better and that's not even as close as good as the TV series.Screenplay is basically simple,direction is good an the acting is average.The best thing about the movie are special or should i say visual effect's.They are phenomenal.If you're asking me does this movie deserves all the attention it got i say no,if you ask me is it a bad movie i say no,if you ask me does it deserves to be on any list an not only IMDb's 250 list i most definitely say no!!!Star Trek is a highly overrated movie and there is no chance or way that it's better than Dances with wolves,Gladiator,Out of Africa,The Deer hunter,Braveheart,No country for old men,Sin City,Ben Hur,Platoon,Gandhi,Gone with the wind,Scarface,Manhattan,Mystic River and many,many others....Don't believe the rating's.This movie doesn't deserves to be on 5000 list an barely on 250 list!!!

A journey that I found very enjoyable & I'm sure it stands up for someone fresh the Star Trek ( does such a person exist?) It contained a couple of interesting detours from world we know already but all familiar people (include Captain Pike in similar state to we last saw him )& places are there. The performances of Zachary Quinto(Spock) & Karl Urban (Bones) perfectly pitched to re-animated two well loved the characters.It has left the new Star trek Universe in the position to boldly go to some familiar places it's been before ( but all of them )& take some very different routes with regarding to the crew relationships.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My worst fears were left unfounded...the movie is AWESOME!,"Wow...that is all I can muster...wow! Look, I am a die hard trekkie through and through. I am a fan of all the series' and mythology (except possibly ""Enterprise"") but still have to rate the original series as my top choice.

Those kinds of liberties are the things that can kill any good will that may have possibly been generated in me for series's like that.That is why I initially held a certain amount of apprehension with regards to the movie. Of course I was going to see it regardless, but I retained a healthy dose of skepticism about how they were going to pull off the feat of having all the primary members of classic Trek meet on the Enterprise, as opposed to how conventional Trek history dictates their collective histories unfold separately. I was very satisfied with how this was resolved...it was cleverly conceived, plotted and written! It never seemed like a half-assed attempt to throw the disparate elements together in the hopes of having it somehow come together.The characterizations were probably the greatest strengths of the movie. In particular, for me, Karl Urban as McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty were absolutely priceless and spot-on! Urban was especially believable as the younger, but still cantankerous ""Bones."" He not only bore a striking physical similarity to youthful DeForest Kelly, but his vocal mannerisms and facial expressions were so accurate as to be almost frightening!OK, to sum up, new Star Trek movie = an unparalleled YAY! My worst fears...the ones of this being a lame, uninspired, tacky and confusing rip-off appear unfounded! This is a welcome edition to universe of Star Trek and I sincerely hope that we can enjoy this ensemble for many years to come!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Despite some confusions i still liked this movie,"First of all the techs gadgets concept acting directing and action are the things which I liker in this movie but what a concept they were leading to I can't understood properly.How did the future Spock came into the past and all. But still the movie was popcorn and fun more concentration is given to concept not action which is not good but I liked it.I never heard about star trek that's why may be I not understood the concept but its OK it was still a paid off movie and enjoyable.I liked ""into darkness"" its sequel it was also filled with new concepts and all when thing I can't understood is the story they were trying to show but that's OK I will watch it like a popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Get over yourself Trekkers / Trekkies,"I went to see the new Star Trek movie today with a completely open mind, expecting radical changes, if not a total reboot of this iconic space opera. To be honest, I was blown away by the visual feast presented to us by Mr Abrams & co, and also the total respect shown for this iconic franchise. I don't class myself as an avid fan, just someone who's enjoyed Trek in it's many forms over the years. On my return home, I immediately read the user reviews on IMDb and my feelings echoed many of the very positive reviews on this site. There are however, a few hard core trekkies / trekkers who need to get over themselves. Trek had become very tired under the stewardship of Rick Berman and many of the actors were well past their prime. There was little point in continuing the movie franchise based on any of the previous Trek series with the respective actors. Even the TNG cast seem to be getting on a bit now! What we have here is a fresh vibrant take on classic Trek, with broad appeal for a 21st Century audience. Some of the comments are very negative about this new film, as it does not relate to the gospel of Roddenberry or follow the Star Trek canon. We have to be realistic - Hollywood is not going to produce the type of cerebral Trek, this small hardcore community hanker after. Star Trek 2009 may have a few plot shortcomings, but the excellent cast, fast paced action, stunning visuals and fresh feel of this new film certainly left me eager for a second helping, even if I was a little shocked at how old Leonard Nimoy looked! Bring on Star Trek 2!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good stuff,"I admit I am a huge fan of Star Trek and wasn't expecting much at first, but now I have seen this movie multiple times and it just gets better.Amazing casting, non-stop action, good story (not impeccable but very good), amazing camera work and post production work. Nice soundtrack as well, nothing like a classical masterpiece, but effective, especially in the concluding generic where it superposes the new and old themes in counterpoint.Overall I don't understand old fans having a grudge against this more action oriented movie, that's what a star trek movie should be; leave the holodeck pool parties for the series. They've brought Star Trek back big-time, just when we thought it was going to fade away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
JJ has destroyed the essence of Star Trek,"I worked on engines with my father when I was 6 years old. That was around 1970. Computers weren't controlling them, everything was done mechanically so they were pretty easy to understand; valves opened, a mix of fuel and air was created by the carburator and introduced into the cylinder chambers down the intake manifold. Valves closed, then spark, transmitted to the plugs via the coil & distributer, ignited the mixture forcing the piston down in it's chamber creating kinetic energy by turning the drive shaft which ultimately turned the tires making the car go. This is how all engines work. When I was a kid I thought Star Trek was really stupid but it was me who was ignorant. How is it that we always think something we don't understand is stupid? In 1970 the Enterprise's engine room and that warp core didn't look like any engine I'd ever seen. J.J. has dumbed the new S.T. down so far that I wouldn't have thought it was stupid if I was to have seen his version as a kid. This is the main reason I hate what he's done. He's doing such a disservice to the viewers. In many ways, by taking away the plausible advanced physics, he's aligned it - dumbed it down - so that the passive consumers who've been taking over for the last 30 years or so can easily understand it. Without curiosity we'll not go anywhere new, build anything great or create anything awesome. J.J. Abrams has made the Enterprise look like the U.S.S Apple-Store with an engine room from the U.S.S. Titanic Samuel Adams. In general something that fits into what an uneducated mind thinks it should look like and that's a bad thing. The engine room is the size of an Amazon fulfillment center, has .. what - like 20 freak'n warp cores? The only reason it's so huge and there's so many pipes and water tanks on a starship that uses anti- matter as it's primary energy source is because that imagery fits into what an uneducated mind - sadly a closed mind - finds familiar and comfortable. Anti-matter is the most powerful energy source known to man. It is real and awesome. 1 second of warp-core energy is equal to all electricity produced on Earth since there's been electricity production! It's power on a scale nearly unimaginable and truly nothing that's familiar. That's why the original S.T. was so great and J.J.s version pretty much sucks. In the original S.T., and all the movies and spin off series and in the real world of plausible physics - you'd only need 1 warp core, not much space for it (or water for that matter) and I only know this because when I was a kid I thought it was so stupid THAT IT PROMPTED ME TO LEARN HOW DUMB AND WRONG I REALLY WAS. It prompted me to read the blueprints, users manuals and technical books that my Trekky nerd friends had. That reading, that search for knowledge ultimately taught me that warp 5 wasn't the speed of light X5. It's the speed of light exponentially multiplied; SoL X SoL X SoL X SoL X SoL! These figures are off the charts fast covering distances incredibly vast! I write this for you, the new viewers, because J.J.s version won't prompt you to search for explanations of anti-matter and warp core engines so you won't experience the sheer awe these revelations the original S.T. lavished on me. J.J. is denying you of this. You'll not be prompted to learn that warping and much of the science on S.T. was conceived in the early 1900's by theoretical physicists Einstein, Rosen and Heisenberg - to name a few and unless you go to school specifically for this you'll not learn how they all wrote (and got published) papers on the physics used in Star Trek before there was common use of light-bulbs and air travel. You'll not learn that, by using antimatter, space is warped and it is moved around the ship effectively nullifying the galactic light- speed limit. Long before he was the nom de plume of the Walter White, Heisenberg (or more specifically the principal he created) predicted that you could never know where all the atoms in something were because just by observing/measuring them they are changed so something called the Heisenberg compensator is needed and is responsible for allowing the transporter to function. I'm not a professional who used this knowledge to further mankind but many other Trekkies - people who grew up in the 60's - are and have directly credited Star Trek for the innovations they've created. I learned about Einstein & theoretical quantum physics as a hobby because of the Original Star Trek. That's a great thing to glean from entertainment - knowledge of how the universe works. What is the J.J. version going to prompt you to learn? Sadly I believe - nothing. Now, after stating the above, I hate to say this but other than the disservice JJ's done in removing all the science they're not bad actors! Superficially its fun but compared to the original it's sadly lacking. Vince",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Flare-o-rama Popcorn Fun,"J.J. Abrams reboots the Star Trek franchise with a whole new cast. Chris Pine is a leading man Kirk with less overacting. Quite frankly, there's no way to overact more than Shatner. Zoe Saldana is a sexy Uhura. Simon Pegg adds more comedy to Scotty. Zachary Quinto is the one that truly shines as the new Spock.J.J. does a bit of a cheat in the story construction. It's an alternate universe. Of course that's perfectly acceptable in the sci-fi world. It also helps that J.J. is shooting in a different style than every other Star Trek movie. It is more action oriented, more glowy, more flashy, and more camera flares than humanly possible. More than all the others, it's good popcorn fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The hype doesn't match the film. Good but not great.,"When you consider that this was made by one of the most successful creative minds of the past decade as well featuring a semi-cool premise, this could have been a much better movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film. In fact, I give it a thumbs up. Still,it's not half as great as the hype. There are a handful of loud scenes, some chuckles, but not enough gas to cover even the action junkies who don't care about a plot. This movie simply does not work as an action piece but doers work for the Trekkie. In the end, Star Trek provides for a few bangs, but doesn't turn it into a full-blown summer film and ultimately, not as great as everyone keeps trying to say that it is. Considering that it was suppose to revive a dead franchise and reportedly had a huge budget, I wonder where the money truly went? I'm betting it went in to advertising and paying Internet bloggers. The hype doesn't match the film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not a story about the beginning, but a new one","Star Trek is the first movie I can recommend seeing this year. Star Trek was done very well. I give mad props for the well done cast selections. They really expand the movie and give it depth. Even the ""red shirt no name man"" is in the story. If you are looking for good sci-fi and some laughs, this is the movie for you. I enjoyed the story line and look forward to the next one that comes out. As with all sequels I hope that they are able to recast all these characters. There was a lot of time put into finding the right people. With that, I hope they don't loose them in the next movie, because the movie will suffer. An actor from Heros was hard to convince myself that he was a good guy and not the villain despite knowing he is a good guy in this movie. The movie does not require knowing the old story line to enjoy, but if you do, the you will love it. It is a longer length movie, but you will hardly notice the time go by unless you constantly look at your watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Space action-adventure that's good enough on its own merits.,"I won't be comparing this with Star Trek canon or the previous films and shows. Suffice to say this film delivers a non-stop rush of sci-fi action and special effects that is sure to satisfy anyone's thirst for the stuff.The acting and characterisation of the main protagonists, Kirk and Spock, are well captured and delivered, though they are not consistently likable cadets. They bring out a lot of human qualities to the film that people can associate with. There's good chemistry and charm between them that keeps you interested throughout the roller-coaster story. The rest of the cast are serviceable but not outstanding, although Bones does a good job at injecting some world-weary cynicism and humanity to an otherwise tense plot.Kirk's rise to captaincy and the relationship with his crew is actually more interesting than the heavy-handed revenge scenario that takes itself a little too seriously and tries to be too clever for its own good. Unfortunately, the elements of highbrow sci-fi become too confusing and silly and this let down the decent drama built up over the course of the film.The main villain, Nero, gives the film an air of menace whenever he's around but his personality and motivations are poorly fleshed out and not rationalised very well. In essence he and his crew take the role of one-dimensional villains that receive very little screen time.Overall, Star Trek does a good job at maintaining excitement and interest but at the same time delivers a flawed and unnecessarily complicated story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it!,"And I'm a trekkie from way, way back. I expected to see some disparaging comments from the radicals, but the depth of emotion on some of the rants I've read surprise me.Take it for what it is; an attempt to reboot the franchise without all the continuity issues that would come from placing it in the same reality.And a damn good attempt it was.

This newest version of Star Trek is sure to wind up on a lot of those ""must see movie"" lists. It was totally a very pleasant and uplifting experience watching this movie. It was witty, funny, emotional and also visually appealing as well. The acting from all of the cast was excellent, with very little ""cheesiness.""

A Spectacular Experience,"After I saw the teaser trailer for this on the Iron Man DVD, I decided to check it out. And it was awesome, Even though I really haven't watched most of the Star Trek TV series or the films, but I say this is a great reboot to the Star Trek films.The film stars Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Simon Pegg, Leonard Nimoy, etc.I go over the story.When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship US Kelvin, Captain George Kirk substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero (Eric Bana) in his vessel to negotiate a cease fire, in the command of the US Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife that is in labor; while she delivers their son James Tiberus Kirk in the hospital shuttle-craft, George Kirk crashes the US Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk (Chris Pine) grows up and when he meets Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar fight, he is invited to join the Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock (Zachary Quinto) grows-up discriminated by his half-human condition. They meet each other in the Starfleet Academy, where Spock accuses Kirk of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack and the Federation spaceships head to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Spike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Spike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock assumes the bridge and has a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded in the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by an old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that explains to him that Captain Nero blames him and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed with the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge. Now Kirk has to find a way to save Earth, the next destination of Narada.So far this is one of the top action movies of 2009, along with Transformers 2, District 9, 2012, Avatar and Sherlock Holmes.Star Trek gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More Star Wars then Star Trek,"I am a fan of the original series, so this one was a disappointment on many levels. They were a lot of trademark from the original missing for example interesting philosophy and hypothesis about outer space, Kirk is more of a pimp in the original ones and few more things like that.I was expecting kick ass action with a script true to the series.It was completely untrue to the what will happen next in series. Captain Pike and Kirk don't meet until much later in series. Uhura never had an affair with Spock. Chekov comes much later in the series. Kirk had a brother. And many other details like this that bother me.I think it looks more like Star War then Star Trek. Example that creature with Scotty.Never the less the action is good, the actors are good, the effects are good and it's never boring. But it will be frustrating if you are a fan of the originals.I think the script and story line are quite lousy. And they did a lazy job keeping it true.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WARNING: Overdose on Lens Flaring and Droning Soundtrack,"Good Grief! Why the overuse of lens flaring? We get that this movie is an attempt to be a reboot for the masses and that you have to upgrade your stylistic approaches to film making and such to catch the attention of ""tweens"" and the like...but jeez, almost half the film consisted of this technique which made me feel nauseous 3 minutes into the movie.Mind you, this technique can be masterfully executed if used correctly (example: Very end of The Dark Knight with the lens flare as the bike drives off into the darkness).Soundtrack in my opinion was very uninspired and the same dramatic theme was overplayed through several of the movies jarring scenes. Although not expecting much from the movie, I was hoping to here the epic Jerry Goldsmith theme thunder through the film at some point (was that expecting too much?), but sadly it was given a whimper at the end.The ending BTW felt tacked on as an attempt to appease loyal Star Trek fans...I just didn't buy it. As one reviewer mentioned, it definitely felt like watching ""OC"" or ""90210"" Space Opera at times.By the way, I'm not hating on this film. Picture a ride at Disney World which throws a bunch of action scenarios at you as you proceed through the ride. It's a lot of fun as you go through and you may remember some good parts, but the experience itself as a whole is forgettable (well, not as forgettable as this film, as there are some excellent rides at Disney World :). Some great FX, funny scenes and character interactions make this a movie worthwhile seeing in the movies at least once...Enjoy the ride.Star Trek rates a 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Film Making!,"Everything I go to the movies for! Fantastic action! Compelling characters! Seamless story telling! Suspense! Appropriate comic elements! This new telling of the Star Trek story out does every previous telling without taking away from the countless hours of Star Trek entertainment already available in film and TV. I loved the acting. I loved the casting. I was drawn into the story from the very beginning and then stayed completely engaged to the very last frame. Sometimes I go to the theaters just hoping to escape from the world and its cares for a couple of hours and just enjoy pure entertainment. Star Trek gave me this experience. Don't miss this one!

It was true to the original while taking us where no Trekkie has gone before.,"I was a little put out by the special effects extravaganza and the childhood scenes of Spock and Kirk at the beginning, and thought, ""Oh no. This is going to be a long two hours."" Then Doctor Leonard McCoy showed up and I started to enjoy it. From the middle of the movie on, I had a silly grin on my face. I was utterly full of joy. Since I was four years old, I've loved Spock, Kirk, Bones, Chekhov, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, and this movie brought them all back to life in an amusing and satisfying way--which I did not think possible. Of course, the Romulan threat, with the intense Eric Bana as the menacing Nero, was as formidable an enemy as always. Simon Pegg's Scotty was humorous and his Scottish accent was perfectly over the top. Leonard Nimoy as the future Spock seemed a little contrived at first, put there to please us old Trekkies, but in the end, I was convinced that he was needed. I can see that the film would be enjoyable to people who'd never seen a Star Trek film in their lives, but I can't help but feel sorry for them because they couldn't possibly get just how clever these film makers were in their casting, directing, effects, etc. to give a classic a face-lift without making it look like plastic.A Fun, Fun film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK Star Trek film,"The good aspects of this film are......Absolutely stunning visuals. For this reason I am kicking myself for not having seen it in the cinema. If you have invested in a premium home entertainment system, with wide screen, hi-fi stereo and blu-ray disk, you will collect on your investment watching this film.Excellent actions scenes. There's fist fights, running firefights with phasers, and ship to ship battles.Also, there's a cute sense of nostalgia. I like the fact that the original Enterprise bridge noises are back.The bad:The theme music is lame, and there really is too much of it. Every second scene seems to conclude with an unnecessarily loud blast of orchestral crescendo. I find this annoying. And as directing techniques go, it's about as subtle as holding up a placard saying ""this is really dramatic, folks!""And more importantly, the characters' motivations are somewhat nonsensical. For this reason, I have rated the film only 6, rather than 7.

A Brilliant Re-Invention of a Long-Loved Franchise,"It has been a long time since I've been so blown away by the Star Trek franchise, with most of it's films in the past 20 years being underwhelming (with the exception of FIRST CONTACT). I was a fan when I was a kid but the later series and films caused my interest to wane of the years. So, when news was released the there was not just another movie in the works, but a reboot, I wasn't entirely thrilled. The inclusion of J.J. Abrams as director grabbed my attention but I was waiting to reserve judgment until it was released. For a STAR TREK reboot movie to truly succeed, the casting would have to be spot-on and it would need to excel where the recent films had failed: plot. After having seen the film in theaters (and multiple times since on DVD), I was blown away at how epic the final product was. STAR TREK was back, and thanks to Abrams, it was better than ever.The plot is probably the weakest element of the film but it was still done well enough that any minor plot grievances on my part were instantly forgiven. The film brings us back to the very beginning, as the familiar crew of the USS Enterprise are completing their run in Starfleet Academy and are first assigned aboard the ship under the command of Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). On it's initial mission, the Enterprise crew encounter a disgruntled Romulan from the future intent on destroying the Federation, one planet at a time, in an attempt to avenge the death of his family and the destruction of his homeworld. In general, it's no so bad but the inclusion of the mysterious, unexplained ""red matter"" and use of black holes for time travel felt cliché and didn't fit into the established epic scope of the film.The special effects in the film were amazing! I loved the sleeker, more graceful redesign of the Enterprise and all of the space battle sequences were some of the best since the original STAR WARS trilogy. Granted, Abrams use of lens flares may detract from the style of the movie but the production design was easily one of the most impressive aspects of the film. Everything...the bridge of the Enterprise, the planet Vulcan, everything down to the smallest shuttlecraft...was beautiful.Finally, the most important question in my mind prior to watching the movie: how were the performances of those brought in to replace the original actors for these legendary characters? I was worried the younger cast was going to give the film a WB melodrama vibe but it couldn't be farther from the truth. Each of the cast seemed to embrace the spirit of those who came before them. Chris Pine as James Kirk came off as a bit too abrasive at first, but there were moments where you could see some inspired Shatner in his performance (particularly the Kobyashi Maru simulation scene). One performance I loved that I wish had been given more screen time was that of Simon Pegg as Scotty, who unfortunately doesn't make an appearance until the second hour of the film. The biggest surprise in the film (as I never saw it coming) was Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. Leonard McCoy. Seriously, Urban captured every mannerism and speech inflection of DeForest Kelley and did his great justice in his performance.Going in with low expectations to this film, I was happy to find it actually ranks as one of my favorite movies in 2009. Abrams has reinvented STAR TREK and made it cool; of all the films in the franchise, this film is the most accessible to non-fans of the series and it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's a blast to watch and it's reinvigorated my interest in the franchise after years of disinterest. Enjoy...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek Reset,"To be honest, I really enjoyed this movie while watching it. Except for the borderline stupid car scene with young James T. and the red and obvious out of place designed ice monster nothing worried me - a fantastic exposition followed by a comic and fast-paced story. BUT... when the film is over and one gets some time to breath and especially some time to think one pretty fast realizes that this flick is a big and nasty black hole regarding screen writing and intelligent movie making in general. Nonsense follows nonsense follows nonsense. Read the critics below - they are absolutely right. It's a ridiculous movie. Not because it's about space ships and time travelling and all that stuff. It's because the makers decided to create a stupid, speedy, action packed movie for bald entertainment instead of some clever, speedy, action packed adventure.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan too. The only similarities is that they are set in space. Both George Lucas and Gene Roddenberry were genius in their own right.

A new life and a new story for the Enterprise.,"The film franchise ""Star Trek"" began in the seventies at the expense of the enormous popularity of a TV series. Films have succeeded and, if we think about it, we can consider two cycles of films (the Kirk cycle and the Picard cycle) but, no matter how much they change, they have always tried to maintain that inspirational connection with the source, the TV series. This movie is finally breaking with that. The series is no longer in the memory of the overwhelming majority of the audience and only the staunchest fans will challenge what this movie did: write a new story for ""Star Trek"", as if we could spend an eraser on everything that has been said and done so far and recreate everything from the scratch. Well, I usually take these exercises with caution but, I confess, I enjoyed the final product. I'm not from the generation that saw the series, so it doesn't shock me seeing the characters being reinvented with a brand new story. It can even be refreshing for new audiences.Despite previous films, this film bets heavily on special effects and CGI. This made it visually terrific, even when these CGI seems quite unrealistic (the effect created when ""Enterprise"" reaches warp seems more and more like a submarine navigating fast forward). The actors did a very positive job and the least positive point was the romance between Spock and Uhura, with Kirk trying to make a triangle with them. This always seemed strange in the plot, even considering Kirk's womanizing, irresponsible and stubborn behavior. I enjoyed revisiting Leonard Nimoy in the character that earned him fame and success.

A Great alternative to the series.,"I'm a fan of many of the star trek series, I like the whole universe.This film is great, it stands apart from the series in that, it's shorter, has better effects, is more action orientated. etc. Many would even claim it's not really star trek because they changed too much, blah blah.I like that whole time travel resulting mess that this film uses as a basis for it's plot. Those who are expecting this guy to be the this and this species to be that, because they were in the series which for the most part are set after this film. Are in for a shock when everything gets changed around, making the plot intriguing and surprising.Coupled together with stunning visual effects, the sound of the warp engine igniting is almost erotic and great acting from the cast, makes this one of the best movies to spend your money this decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Smart, Brisk New Direction for the Franchise","J.J. Abrams re-imagines one of science fiction's best-loved franchises, modernizing it in a technological sense without losing the aura of uncharted adventure that's so crucial to its identity. It looks sleek and new, appropriately forward-gazing, but it still feels like Star Trek. Just... without quite so many grey hairs.It's a bit more pop than the earlier model(s), with a heavier emphasis on action scenes and the typical Abrams tendency towards gigantic set pieces, which some might read as a sort of dumbing-down to reach broader audiences. A fair criticism, but it's a necessary change to keep pace with the super-budget blockbuster crowd. Big-time plot developments are tossed around like loose change, including the annihilation of two core planets (plus much of their inhabitants) and an essential use of time travel to distinguish the new crew members. That's a lot of forward motion for a series that had been relatively slow to rock boats in the past, but I found the speedier tempo to be a welcome shift. With only a few expositionary exceptions, it punches pedal to metal from the prologue and maintains a speedy, engaging pace for the duration.Most every casting decision is made with care and discretion, the effects work is universally appealing and unique (it caught a lot of flack at the time for using so many lens flares and hand-held shots, but I think those add a necessary layer of intrigue and validity to the environment) and the universe feels broad and alive, both in the variety of alien races present in most scenes and the physical realities of life aboard an operational spacecraft. My one major gripe is that it gets way too cute with all the winks and nods to franchise lore. Once or twice, okay, that's a nice bone for the die-hards if it fits the moment. But this script is absolutely soaked with them and it quickly grows forced and unwieldy.A good start for the new crew, clearing the field for contemporary adventures without disrespecting their long, storied history. Youthful and energetic, it zings right along with staggering sights, steep stakes, mesmerizing monsters and one or two familiar faces.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I enjoyed it so much, the one thought I had during that entire was ""When's the next one?"". Over the years, I looked into all the other Trek things & started to understand what Star Trek was originally envisioned as, and I believe that the message it conveys was missing from this one, it's still a wild awesome thrill ride through & through... the effects were great, the casting is phenomenal & the action was... well, awesome!!!Overall, I'd say this was a great stat to one of my now favorite franchises of all time!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history.,"It would not be an overstatement to say that this is quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history. After decades of derivative and diminished sequels and spin-offs, J.J. Abrams has managed to re-imagine the venerable classic in a way that is both true to the original and at the same time completely original. At the same time, he has rebooted the franchise in a way that will silence all the canon critics and created an independent and fresh future for years to come. Don't believe me? The sequel is already announced.The problem with all the previous sequels was that they became increasingly diluted by budget constraints and cramped creativity as compared to their peers. With an estimated budget of $150 million, this sequel was anointed as the heir apparent to the franchise, and succeeded brilliantly.Abrams could have approached this project with the cautious reverence it deserves, except that it deserved more, and Abrams knew it. We are given the obligatory historical references, and they are immensely satisfying, but they are also shrewdly seductive, as they lead us down the path of complacency. But from the beginning you get a sense that something isn't right, and you begin to wonder, ""is he blowing it here?"" These deviations accelerate and, before long, reach a point of no return. Now you're on the edge of your chair, where you belong, and you wonder how he's going to make it all right again. He doesn't.Instead, we are shown a radically and irretrievably altered world where everything we thought we knew is swept away and replaced with a pristine tabula rasa. At last, Star Trek takes us, with glee and innocence, where no man has gone before. I would not have thought it possible, but this sequel is at once imbued with everything we liked best about the original series, and deviously enhanced by new possibilities, new capabilities, and a stunning Universe to once again explore anew.There is time travel invoked, but, for once, it is not used as a Cosmic Mulligan. There is no do-over. A Romulan ship from the future arrives from a black hole to wreak revenge for a destroyed world, seeking to destroy other worlds in its path. The Enterprise and her intrepid crew, displaying all the humor, courage, and heroism for which we have come to love them, set out to save what is left of the Federation. If that doesn't make you want to see the movie, nothing will.As a professor, I deal with people of all ages, all walks of life. Everyone I have spoken to raves about this film like none other that I can recall. As for me, I left the theatre with a feeling that maybe F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong when he said ""There are no second acts in American life."" That may have been true in Fitzgerald's time, but Star Trek, in all its revisionist glory, stands as proof that we live in a time when even the most tattered among us can reinvent ourselves with verve and purpose. Is this not the greatest gift that cinema has to offer?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A for effort.,"Much like the first Star Trek movie, this one leaves a little to be desired. I guess the ""odd numbered curse"" lives on! The film moves at a breakneck pace at first, and then slows down significantly with the boredom alleviated with the timely arrival of Scotty, played brilliantly and with fervor by Simon Pegg.Abrams made it clear that this was not a Star Trek film for Star Trek fans, and this shows most evidently in the characterization of Spock. I can't really explain without giving too much away, but from a writing standpoint... if this was to be a re-launch of all that made Star Trek great for a new generation of viewers then any future revelations about Spock or Vulcan philosophy in general have been rendered somewhat meaningless. Abrams tore away all the much discussed conflicts within the vaunted philosophy of logic, and with a bit of ""gleeful contempt"" as well.The villain, Nero, is unmemorable -- as is the main plot. The only refreshing change, for good or bad, is that Starfleet makes no effort to fix things! But, of course, since Abrams and company have incorporated a much hackneyed plot device to create a ""new re-boot reality"" for Star Trek, they couldn't fix it now, could they? A quick assessment of the cast is as follows: Chris Pine plays an excellent Kirk. He's sexy, reckless and arrogant, but his presence is one of command.Zachary Quinto should have been great as Spock, but his portrayal is too emotional at this early stage and it's very hard to accept him in this role. One particular relationship is also hard to believe.Eric Bana's Nero is a lackluster villain and will be forgotten.Although Bruce Greenwood is a bit too old for the role, he makes an adequate Christopher Pike.Karl Urban is DeForest Kelly. He seems a bit out of place in a ""Star Trek movie not meant for Star Trek fans"" -- but he is an absolute joy to watch in every scene.Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a bit more ""stuck up"" than her predecessor, but that's to be expected, I suppose. This is the 21st century:) She's edgy, and very sexy.Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg. I want a full on Scotty movie!! John Cho makes for a (finally) kick-butt Sulu! Anton Yelchin as Chekov was a little harder to accept. The accent was so forced, and felt like another case of ""gleeful contempt"" on the part of Abrams. Making fun of the accent by engaging in a hyperbolic exaggeration of it. It's only clever when you don't notice it, but the accent is omnipresent in every Chekov scene.Ben Cross as Sarek was a brilliant casting move.Sure, as an old Star Trek fan (I began watching it with my dad in the mid '70s, and I was named after Jeffrey Hunter and even my middle name, Christopher, was chosen because of his Pike character) I can nitpick the heck out of this movie. The science is bad (a black hole is not a wormhole), some of the continuity changes make no sense (which makes one wonder why any effort at all was made to reconcile this re-boot with the original series), etc, etc. I could go on, but it would be giving too much away.But, all in all, it was a fun ride and is one of (if not the) best looking films in the franchise. A little shallow, perhaps, but that seems to be par for the course this movie season. So, maybe it played like a cheesy TV show sometimes but isn't that in the spirit of things? I definitely give it an A for effort. Something had to be done as the franchise had run dry more than a decade ago leading me to abandon the franchise (especially after the arrival of the far superior Babylon 5 series).And remember. If you're going on an away mission, don't wear red!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
May This New Trek Live Long And Prosper,"Let me say up front I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I did grow up watching original series re-runs, the tapes of the movies, I've seen episodes from the spin-off shows and I've read some of the novels here and there so I've got a good working knowledge of the show. Having assumed that Star trek was dead after the lack-luster Nemesis and the cancellation of Enterprise (a show that remains underrated in my opinion) I was rather surprised over a year ago when the teaser trailer for this movie popped up before Cloverfield announcing that J.J. Abrams was bringing it back. Having raised my expectations since then I went to a screening last night with hopes for a good Star Trek movie. That in short was what I got and more.To start off with there's the cast. It's never an easy task replacing a well known cast with a new group of actors especially when the cast in question is those of the original Star Trek series but not only has this film done it has done well. I was initially skeptical of Chris Pine as Kirk but Pine not only fills the rather large shoes left before him but fills them admirably and by the end of the movie you have no doubt that he is Captain James T Kirk. In truth that statement can really be applied to the entire cast of ""new"" old characters but in particular it can be said of Zachary Quinto as Spock and Simon Pegg as Scotty as both fill some rather large shoes very nicely indeed. There's also a nice (if underused) villain in the form of Eric Bana as Nero plus a fantastic supporting cast including the ever excellent Bruce Greenwood plus Ben Cross and a woefully underused Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. And then there's the return of Leonard Nimoy to the role that made him famous in some of the best and most unexpected scenes of the movie. In short it's one of the best Star Trek casts.This has also got some really good production values. The set designs have echoes from the original series but give a nice modern feel to them and this is especially true of the bridge of the Enterprise itself. The film's CGI is (in two words I use very infrequently) awe-inspiring especially when it comes to the various ships sued in the film but especially of the Enterprise which looks like a perfect meshing of both the original TV series ship and the one used in the original series cast movies. In fact if one can find nothing else to say about this film it is that it has the best special effects in the history of Star Trek to date.The film is an action film with a good story. From the opening teaser sequence right thru to the end the film is full of space battles, sword fights and fist fights. The fights are all well staged and put similar sequences in the two most recent Trek films to shame. The space battles, thanks to the excellent CGI mentioned above, also come across as the best yet done for Star Trek as whole. Yet while this might be an action film it hasn't lost what makes Star Trek so good to begin with: story. In what can be called increasingly rare in the Hollywood action movie the writers actually take the time to explore character development. In fact it is the journey of these two young men whose destines has always been intertwined that forms the emotional center of this movie. That really brings us to the Nimoy scenes and the sticky issue of continuity.As I said I'm not a die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me say the following. While this film features the original group of characters from the original series they're different versions of them. This is thanks to one of the tried and true plot devices of Star Trek: time travel and interference with the past. That said the interference causes a lot of changes from the subtle to moments where I can see some going ""blasphemy on the alter of Roddenberry!"" In particular there's two plot points (one of them being a relationship) which might do that but for those of us who realize (as the movie itself says) that the past has been altered and this is a new time-line it shouldn't be anything too upsetting and if fact it makes for some fascinating viewing. The film is also full of nice little references to various Trek stories of the past especially the best of the Trek films The Wrath of Khan. The scenes with Nimoy (including the most impressive Vulcan mind meld I've ever seen) illustrate this point beautifully: this is the end of the beginning and the start of a whole new Trek.Another aspect that brings the point of this being both an ending and a new beginning is the score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek has always been known for some nice film score and this film is no exception to the rule. The score is bombastic when it needs to be and personal when it needs to be. Giacchino also makes very sparing use of the classic Star Trek theme itself until the end credits to let the audience know for certain that while things might have changed this is still Star Trek.If this new Star Trek movie is any indication there's a life for this little TV series after all. With a fine cast, well designed sets, fantastic CGI work, well staged action, nice scripting and good music I can say one thing for certain. If this is the future of Star Trek then may this new Trek live long and prosper.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good movie,"I had no interest in Star Trek before or after I watched this movie. The reason why I decided to watch this movie was because of the release of the sequel(I believe) of this movie called ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" I heard people saying it is a great movie and I should watch it so I decided to watch the ""Star Trek: The beginning"" before I watch its sequel. I have never seen any Star Trek related series whether it was on TV or Theater and I didn't have that much expectation when I borrowed DVD to watch Star Treck the Beginning. Nonetheless, I have to say it was great decision to view this film. It has a great and easy story line that anyone who doesn't have a knowledge about the Star Trek could understand and beautiful scenes and computer graphics which satisfied my taste. Now I'm pretty excited to go watch the sequel of this movie and despite of the fact that I don't consider myself to become a fan of the series, however, I think it is still a great movie to watch whether you are a fan or not of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really Good Fun,"I found Star Trek surprisingly good, from start to finish it struck just the right balance between action set piece and character building exposition - telling its own unique story whilst at the same time establishing the well known crew of the USS Enterprise in their respective roles. The director does well with material that could so easily have been turned into a flashy fast pile of nonsense but rather he keeps it engaging and entertaining throughout. The actors put in some good performances too - with a young Bones and Spock having the mannerisms of their characters' original players down to an absolute tee. Part of me expected the usual needless love story that you tend to get in these sorts of blockbusters, or maybe a scene of blatantly contrived tear-jerking but there are none here. The fatty excess has been trimmed away perfectly leaving a really succulent effort to sink your teeth into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely NOT Trek by the numbers,"I have been a Fan of Star Trek for most of my life. I admit I had SEVERE trepidation about this movie. After the first 10 minutes into what may have been THE most intense action scene ever in Star Trek my fears were put aside. J.J. Abrams vision of Star Trek was not only refreshing but nothing short of brilliant. Even half way through the film I kept thinking ""what the heck...that never happened."" but after a fateful meeting between young Kirk and old Spock everything is explained and this version of Trek is given a new life. Zach Quintano as Spock was brilliant casting, his performance was excellent. Chris Pine as James T Kirk brought a new level of both cockiness and arrogance that made his portrayal of the famed captain fresh. Karl Urban as McCoy was amazing as was Simon Pegg as Scotty. The best part about this whole movie is that it didn't focus on the usual triumvirate of Kirk,Spock and McCoy. All the members of the crew had involvement in the story and actually had something to do that was so natural they seemed to be playing these characters all along. The action scenes were intense, the special effects were amazing and the sound was incredible. Just a minor note my wife and my daughter , neither of whom are Trek fans in any sense, both wanted to see this. After seeing this movie we are all ready to line up again. I truly hope that they will announce a sequel to this film and carry on with the ongoing mission. Trek is back and in excellent hands... Thank Mr Abrams",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gravity is too strong to resist,"Admittedly a newbie as far as the ""Star Trek"" lore is concerned -- substantiated by an admission that my acquaintance with the iconic sci-fi is limited to the ubiquitous pop culture references (""Beam me up Scotty!"") -- my accession to J.J. Abrams' re-imagining/re-boot/re-whatever of Gene Roddenberry's interstellar mythology is almost of a purely virginal viewpoint, a perspective that should supposedly raise eyebrows among Trekkies for the liberal interpretation done with this franchise restart. Nevertheless, in ""Star Trek"", for all the acrimony to hardcore fans that it might stimulate, Abrams acutely goes for less than a self-conscious nod to its highly esteemed source than a crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster with a broader appeal, typified by its decision to bypass its predecessors' heady issues and moral dilemmas in favor of peachy visuals and aggressive storytelling, resulting to a spectacle that dazzles and a ride that only purists and the most churlish wouldn't cotton to.Years after the death of his father trying to save his starship's people, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) grows up to be a rash hotshot squandering his life away in the cornfields of Iowa, where he is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join Starfleet Academy and follow in his father's footsteps. This brings him face to face with Spock (Zachary Quinto), a smart-ass once bullied for his half-human, half-Vulcan bloodline and from here, it pretty much hovers around establishing the relationship between these two while readily introducing other characters into the fray: Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Scotty (a marvelously cast Simon Pegg).It's to Abrams and screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman's credit that the film zips along through gripping action scenes while still accomplishing to have its actors breath life to their roles, as embodied by Pine and Quinto's soulfully vulnerable rendition of their iconic characters, the same amalgam that has made the Abrams-directed ""Mission: Impossible III"" and Abrams-produced TV shows ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" work. It's a thrill ride that eschews whatever social undertones its previous installments allegedly dearly hold on to, instead going through a candid space opera, a zippy galactic adventure that gravitates one in and makes it, well, futile to resist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Push restart button. Then,enjoy. This Trek will not be painful","This is an elegant and action-filled restart of a 43-year-old TV series.It starts in the middle of battle and never lets off.I had to be dragged to this movie in a way. Yet once the lights went down and the explosions started (I'm a guy, forgive me Mother Theresa) I was hooked. We go back in time to Captain James T. Kirk 's troubled childhood,circa 2300-something A.D., through his near-dismissal from Star-fleet Academy. James was a ne'er-do-well on the farmlands of Iowa headed for a troubled life and the famous Captain Pike recruits him for the Star-fleet Academy. Although he's almost too screwed-up to attend such a disciplined place, James Kirk is there at 0800 hours after a long night of drinking and fighting in a dumpy bar, and gets on board,so to speak. The beauty of this script is the noble, strong and forceful presence of old-time Science Officer Mr. Spock, portrayed here as a young handsome and valiant man by Zachary Quinto. Spock is an instructor at The Academy who initiates disciplinary action against Cadet James Kirk for cheating on an essential,impossible exercise. The action goes to high-gear as the Academy's cadet corps are mobilized to fight an impossible foe with the Star-fleet Command. Through twists and turns now-Officer Kirk and Mr. Spock mobilize near-limitless inner resources and superior command-level skills to solve problem after problem with grace and courage that is charming and stunning.In sum, they're near super-heroes, in all their Technicolor glory.God, what a great story.

Felt more like Star Wars than Star Trek,"As an action space opera, the new Star Trek is great. As Star Trek, it is lacking. It is an action filled shoot-em-up with wonderful effects, competent acting, and an exciting story. However, it lacks intelligence, which it tries to desperately make up for with style and wit. It felt more like Star Wars than Star Trek. There was no message (unlike previous Star Trek, so much of which was modern morality tales and intelligent sci-fi fables) - unless you count the typical Disney bs of believing in yourself, or the importance of teamwork. It is just what you would expect from the commercials. We can only hope that the money which this will make will lead to more intelligent ventures into the franchise.

An infusion of pop culture relevance and unmatched entertainment,"Movies based upon material fuelled by a niche audience or cult following often faces hurdles right off the start. Aside from a loyal core audience, adaptations of television shows, comic books, certain books or even starring a certain actor need to up the ante for a big screen treatment. There are certainly times when a film is specifically intended to strike out only a small wedge of the public, but these are often low budget, spring releases baked later by DVD sales. For big budget, summer blockbusters on the other hand the studios chequebook is on the table along with the hearts of fans, and in the case of Star Trek they hit the jackpot.As far as the Trek world is concerned I am the epitome of a novice. I have never seen a Star Trek movie, I have never watched any of the numerous and long-running television series and I constantly jest my friends who do. Drawn in by impressive trailers and a director who I more than respect, any doubt (or embarrassment) I had was whisked away faster then The Enterprise at warp speed. Funny, engrossing, from what I gather loyal buy wildly accessible and infinitely entertaining, director J.J. Abrams has infused a slowly withering slice of pop culture with pizazz and heart. In the same vein that Iron Man last summer drew in non-fans with likable actors, flawless production values and endless wit and charm, Trek neither panders to the fan boys nor ignores them and if this is to become a trend for blockbusters to come it would be most welcome.Along with the budget and special effects, or to be more accurate, more importantly then the technical elements, Star Trek pulsates with life and the human element thanks to a superb ensemble cast. Before production began, all eyes were on the casting; chiefly that of James Kirk (famously played by William Shatner). Choosing a relative unknown, Chris Pine, for the infamous role could have sunk the film right off the dock yet his boyish charms, smooth line delivery and charismatic presence fills the role to the top. Equally if not more important is the role of Spock, played by Heroes star Zachary Quinto who nails it home with a nuanced but blistering performance. Not an actor does wrong in Trek, and the leads are bolstered further by the likes of Karl Urban as 'Bones' McCoy, the always hilarious Simon Pegg as Scotty, Zoë Zaldana as the silky Uhura, Harold and Kumar's John Cho as Sulu and up and coming star Anton Yelchin as Chevok.In this origin story we see the slow assembly as the classic crew beginning with James Kirk's birth on the USS Kelvin in the heat of battle which results in the tragic death of his father. Years later, a misfit and self-proclaimed charmer he is sucked into Star Fleet by Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) who offers him, simply, more. Rising to the top of his class he soon finds himself and his future crew thrust into action at the whim of a Romulan madman known as Nero (An unrecognizable Eric Bana). As the stakes grow higher so do the tempers of the cocky Kirk and subdued Spock and it is this dynamic that makes the film truly great. The more detailed plot surrounding the story is complex but never confusing and I will leave it for you to experience.When all is added up in the end, there is little fault to be found in Star Trek. The effects are sensational but remain secondary to characters, the performances are uniformly excellent and the pace is taut and the drama often tragic. So even to those (like myself) with really no initial interest in the Trekkie universe, give it a chance as it is an infusion of pop culture relevance and unmatched entertainment.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As a Star Trek It's Not Bad,"First, I should say I am a Star Trek fan - from the beginning. I was a teen laying in front of the TV during the presentation of the original series premiere, and I've been a fan ever since.
It's apparent that this particular story was managed by a Star Wars fan who didn't want to do all the homework required to make it truly a Star Trek. By creating a new timeline, it was easy to present a story that did not have to conform to the franchise history. In that regards, it's a cop-out by JJ Abrams. Still on the bad side of things, it was gimmicky to shorten Captain Kirks academy time and literally circumvent experience. No military or paramilitary organization of any value is going to promote a cadet to Captain. That's a five rank jump for someone with no real experience.
That all being said, the script is otherwise well written and moves along very quickly. By the end of the movie the actors gel, displaying those social quirks that made the original series memorable. Of all the interactions, the relationship between Dr. McCoy and Spock feels the most like that of the original team. Zachary Quinto is exceptional. However, Eric Bana turns the evil Nero into an almost Comic Book villain - he's really over the top. Of all the special effects, travelling at warp is the best. It is presented in a manner that visually conveys the concept to the viewer in an understandable way.
All in all, it's worth the time. It's enjoyable entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The legend returns with enough action and fun for fans and non-fans alike,"As much of a film geek and a science fiction fan as I am, I have never been a huge fan of Star Trek. I enjoyed the films I did see, I appreciated the legendary roles inhabited by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Stewart to name a few, and understood quite a fair bit about the mythology that took place since the 1960s. But when Paramount announced a reboot, with J.J. Abrams at the helm, I got fairly excited. And luckily, for good reason.Packed into a rather twisty and time shifty narrative, Star Trek details the lives of the most notable members of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and how they met and became a crew.Saying anything more would ruin the fun and the surprises Abrams and Co. have in store for fans and non-fans alike. From moment one, it is clear this is less of a film for Trekkers (or Trekkies, depending on how you feel about the title) and more of a film for everyone. Yes, there are stills terms and races of individuals that will baffle anyone not acquainted with Trek-lore, but screenwriters Abrams/Michael Bay-regulars Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman never exploit this. They ensure that everyone will be able to get some semblance of understanding from what is going on and what is being said. There are plenty of laughs as well, giving the film a more universal feel even as it becomes nerve-wreckingly tense. They leave just enough room to stay true to the original films and shows, while carving out their own identity as well.That idea inherently, is what makes this film work so well – it does not rely on everything that has come before to work now. Some purists may not appreciate the subtle and glaring changes the film makes to what has come before, but the film has the attitude of not caring and doing its own thing. There is enough originality and unique moments within the film that it is able to stand on its own. Yes, the original Spock (played again by Nimoy) is integral to the plot of the film, but he never gets in the way of the film being able to start up a new series, a new lore and a new generation of fans. Everything about this film feels like it has been treaded on before, but never like this. Everything old, feels new again. Even the special effects, so important to the series from the start, look incredible and more believable than anything we have ever seen in the franchise before. Anyone expecting something in the vein of what has been done before is going to be sadly disappointed.While I will not complain about the far too common lens flare that appears in an abundance of scenes, but the film does drag itself out in some cases. There is a lot to digest and a lot of characters to flesh out, but for a movie that starts off with the speed of a lightning bolt, it slows down a bit too much in the middle area of the film. It manages the rare challenge of remaining interesting throughout, but it feels like it spreads itself too thin in its midsection. While a lot of recent films seem to have trouble in their pacing, this film especially could have done with a few minor cuts.Despite having a relatively little-known but being fairly recognizable, the cast is excellent in their performances. Chris Pine has just enough arrogance, swagger and charm to embody the eventual Captain Kirk from his first appearance on-screen through the finale. He does not descend into the overacting and self parody of Shatner before him, but he is believable enough to be a younger version of the well-known character. Although known more for being a villain, Zachary Quinto manages to give a stunted and emotional performance as the near-emotionless Spock. He still has the gleam of a villain in his eyes, but he has enough power and gravitas in his performance, especially when we can easily compare him to the original and legendary Spock (credited as ""Spock Prime"" in the end credits), that it is obvious he was born to fill the shoes.Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty, all put forth great work in their supporting performances, no matter how silly some of the material is (Yelchin's Russian accent is stretched a little too far, but is not overbearing). I would have liked a little more of Pegg, but he easily steals the majority of scenes he appears in. Karl Urban stands out among the supporting cast for his straight-laced and often hilarious rendition of Bones. I am not as familiar with the original character as most, but while everyone else is either being dead serious or as offbeat as they come, he gets the most time to just kick back and have fun with his lines and actions. One particular scene involving multiple diagnoses on Kirk is masterfully done by Urban, who despite being set back by a few cheesy lines, makes the performance as strong as any other. Eric Bana, as the Romulan villain Nero, gets a few seriously deadly moments on screen, but is not nearly as fleshed out as everyone else. We understand his motivations, and he appears on-screen frequently, but he just does not have the same spark as everyone else does.For only his second feature, and such a huge project, Abrams has delivered a fine product that is easily the first great film of 2009. The short delay only helped the picture become even better than it could have been. The cast is great, the story is well done, and the film is more fun than I ever imagined it could have been. Here's hoping for a great summer of film.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The film we have been waiting for since 1979,"This is the Star Trek film Trekkers have been waiting for for decades! True to the spirit of the classic series Star Trek tells the adventures of a young Enterprise crew on their first mission. The film is awfully well told and full of action and suspense. It's 127 minutes long and not one of them is boring. However, the film is engaging not only because it is a well made action film but also because it has strong and interesting characters. The acting is superb. With the exception of Chris Pine, all actors manage to make us recognize the original characters without just copying the original actors. Particularly Checkov as Wunderkind is a great character. Pine does not convince as Kirk. The story is Kirk's initiation into becoming a responsible officer but especially in the beginning Pine plays him too smug and too self satisfied. At the end there are a few moments when Shatner's suave performance shines through but all in all Pine lacks the ability to relate to the character. But since the film is more about Spock than Kirk it's not too much of a problem. All in all Stark Trek is one of the few adaptations of TV series that creates something new yet treats the originalm series respectfully.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek (2009) - A Worthy Successor,"There are several good things about the 2009 version of Star Trek; and there are a few flaws. First and foremost, the production values are excellent, and are state of the art, as well as better than the original. The direction is spot on, and the writing is very good for the script.The actors are a mixed bag. Some are better, a few about the same, and one or two need work. Chris Pine is fine as kiddie Kirk, and is actually a bit better than the original. Spock Jr. Is also a bit more complex than the Nimoy Spock, Bones and Sulu are about the same, and Ahora is a definite upgrade. Scotty is not quite as good as the original, nor is the weapons actor.The only true weakness of the film is its predictability. We already know that all the main characters will survive any threat during the film; this eliminates most chances for any realistic suspense. The same problem was part of the Star Wars Trilogy before it descended into subpar sequels afterward.As in the Star Wars Trilogy, the producers have about a three film window in which to exploit the advantages gained by this film; after that, they would be well-advised to go in another direction; perhaps transitioning into a high-end pay per view TV series of some type. I look forward to the next two films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An old trekster accepts it.,"I just saw this movie. I'm 54 and was a child when I saw the original first episode of Star Trek at 10 pm on Thursday night. (later moved to 8pm).

I'm not a die hard trekkie but I have been known to say on occasion, ""Everything you need to know in life you can learn from Star Trek."" I'm a scientist and scifi fan.This movie is enjoyable and is in the spirit of the original series. Somehow they've managed to capture the essence of the characters in these new people. I was believing it was a younger version of them. They even captured the same group humor. I personally am delighted that they have a movie that will without doubt spawn many more. The Star Trek saga has been rekindled and from now on every couple of years we are going to be treated to new adventures with new old friends.As far as the new timeline... who cares.. it will allow for new, re-imagined adventures.

Terrible plot undermines what was otherwise good,"So Star Trek returns with it's most visually stunning outing to date. This movie looks great, with very nice sets, special effects, costumes and action set pieces.Similarly, the casting is very good. Quinto is just perfect as Spock, and I found the choices made for the other characters fine as well. This was one of my biggest concerns for this reboot, so bravo! The story effectively creates a new reality for our characters, a major catastrophe means that this is effectively a different universe to Star Trek:TOS. I think this was probably for the best, freeing the writers from the constraints of the existing storyline. I know that many viewers object to this thinking it somehow invalidates other existing Star Trek franchises. It doesn't because it's a different reality. ST:TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager are real in their own universe and are as valid as ever.But where the movie really falls down is the plot. There are many plot holes, ridiculous coincidences and incomprehensible decisions made by the characters. It seemed like the plot was simply created to string together the action set pieces regardless of how stupid it turned out. I can understand this being an action orientated movie, but I couldn't help but find myself regularly shaking my head at what I was seeing.The plot is so poor it reduces what would have been 10/10 for a 'Wrath of Khan' quality plot to a mediocre 6/10. Please, more of the same for the next movie but write a decent story, or at least one that makes logical sense. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You will Klingon to the edge of your seats with this thrilling star trek ride!,"Well am not going to give too much away with the plot....as most star trek films go this remains neither too enigmatic nor simplistic..suffice to say it does a good job of providing the baseline for the rest of the script to entwine nicely around..And this is what this film is all about...the character development and early beginnings and bringing together of the original crew into what we all recognise and love..Capt Kirk, Spock, Scotty etc...The film has excellent CGI effects and also some great space battles with the inclusion of dramatic explosions and heart stopping visual scenes with amazing realism and impact.I would highly recommend this film to anyone...Trekkie or not....it has certainly set the scene for future incarnations along with more character development and maybe deeper more intriguing story lines...All in all...i would vote this film as one of the better Star Trek movies....and would give it a well deserved 8.5 out of ten!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Seriously I almost died last night from my mind literally being blown. J.J. Abrams did a great job with this film, and he captured the old characters to a T. I am very happy that he did not try and invent the characters to what he wanted instead, he did a great job of keeping the basic personalities while adding a lot of emotion. The only downside to this movie I can think of is the fact that I spent 9.50 on a popcorn and soda for me and my fiancé.

Excellent Movie,"I just watched this movie for the first time, I wanted to see it in theaters but never got the chance.

Also liked the fact that Leonard Nimoy was able to be in this movie playing as Spock. I thought that was pretty cool to actually have the guy who played Spock the whole time come back and play his older self in this movie. Its too bad that William Shatner couldn't be in this movie and dear god i didn't know those two were both 78 thats incredible.

Star trek for a new generation,"I never in a million years, thought i would be able to call myself a star trek fan, but this reboot has seriously changed that! I must admit that i never liked the old star trek movies. i found them boring, slow and repetitive. I wasn't too keen on the fight scenes and found them corny. But i decided to watch the new one on DVD. I was quite familiar with the story line and i knew the characters Kirk, Spock and Scotty.......somehow. But the thing about reboots is that its not relevant to know anything about the old ones, so i thought fu*k it, ill just watch it with an open mind and see if i enjoy it.And did i enjoy........I loved it!The film starts with our main guy Kirk being born and took to earth to be raised by his mother. When he comes of age he decides that he wants to join the starfleet academy, so he can try to become a captain of his own ship, like his father before he. He meets Spock (portrayed brilliantly by Zachary Quinto) and later on Scotty (simon Pegg - brilliant as always. they team up to try and stop an alien race from destroying planets. They destroy planets by creating black holes which is cool!This really is a new star trek franchise aimed at a new generation. I'm sure there will be a new generation of nerdy ""trek"" fans if they continue to make the films like the first one. Hell....... i might even be a ""trek"" nerd if they make sequels, which i really hope they do. there is about 7 different star trek shows so I'm sure they could make a dozen more movies for this rebooted franchise, and ill definitely be at the cinemas for each and every one. 10/10 easy choice Even if you hate star trek, try this movie out and i guarantee, you wont be sorry.By Scott Dewhurst",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek,"I quite enjoyed this. It is a simple, end-to-end action adventure set in space. It doesn't attempt to moralise or philosophise, it is just an interstellar shoot 'em up. Chris Pine is pretty wooden, Zachary Quinto does a passable ""Mr. Spock"" and Anton Yeltsin seems to be having a good time trying to get the onboard computer to recognise his particularly thick ""Chekhov"" accent.

The King is Dead! Long live the King!,"Star Trek has been deconstructed and reconstructed into a new future that allows - finally - the franchise to boldly go where it has not been before.For the un-trekkers: This movie is a mixture of stunning cinematography and fun ""don't take me so seriously"" plot that reboots the previous tired and dated musings of a franchise trapped in it's own zeitgeist. I'll get in trouble for saying this, but it's everything that the prequels to Star Wars wished it could have been.

You are fully capable of deciding your own destiny.,"In 2009, a new film with a new cast portraying old favorites returned to the series' roots to explore strange new worlds populated not by new civilizations but more complex and understandably functional sets and wondrous special effects that improve not on the spirit but certainly the look and feel of the old classics while delivering a film that at once both satisfies the demands of longtime fans and welcomes newcomers eager to accept this version of ""Star Trek"". Smartly and effortlessly blending the new with the old, maintaining the spirit of series creator Gene Roddenberry's vision but at the same time providing to the material a fresh and modern approach, Director J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is more than a summer blockbuster; it's a rekindling of an important milestone in Science Fiction while at the same time boldly plotting a new course towards a limitless, fascinating, and exciting universe of possibilities.Not delving much into the plot, the biggest challenge facing a reboot of Star Trek -- particularly on this scale -- was threefold: the necessary re-casting of iconic characters, the re-design of the Enterprise, and the explanation as to the hows and whys of the differences between the 2009 edition of Star Trek and the long-established and cherished history of the people, places, and things of years past. Abrams' vision succeeds at each level. While the film might have gotten away with little-to-no regard for the latter -- the explanation for the altered reality -- the film not only explains it away but also integrates the reason into the film as the primary plot device. In addition, this is not the first time that ""Star Trek"" has seen itself drastically altered. Abrams' too does that, considering his masterful job of exploring both sides equally in Star Trek, mentioning Starfleet's purpose of being a ""humanitarian and peacekeeping armada"" while at the same time including plenty of action and cementing it all in a decidedly militaristic structure.Most importantly, Star Trek features a cast that might not absolutely resemble the actors that played in Gene Roddenberry's original ""Star Trek,"" but they each understand not only their character's mannerisms but also the importance to the fan base to portray them with a dignity and compassion. In fact, the filmmakers have integrated additional character traits into the story for both dramatic and humorous effect, and the script's understanding of the complexities of the characters further allows the actors to effectively portray them as fans demand. For instance, Sulu's (John Cho) prowess with the blade is utilized in one of the film's pivotal action sequences. Chekov (Anton Yelchin) struggles with the pronunciation of the letter ""v"" in what is the film's funniest scene. Actor Karl Urban delivers the closest approximation of his character through his effort as Dr. McCoy; the speech patterns, the catch phrases, and his attitude towards Spock make for an almost uncanny resemblance to what DeForrest Kelley did with the character. Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of Captain Pike steals the show; he's superb throughout, and his character, too, winds up reinforcing the film's themes of destiny as well as any other with a simple but highly effective nod to the ""Star Trek"" universe when all is said and done. Zoë Saldana's Uhura undergoes the most noticeable change from 1966 to now. She's scripted as a more important character with an attitude and surprise revelation that breaks the norms of established ""Trek"" lore but fit in nicely with the entirety of the film. Zachary Quinto both looks and acts the part of Commander Spock. Spock proves the most pivotal character in the film; his half-Vulcan, half-human heritage plays a crucial role in the movie, and his ability to command his half-human side proves vital to the outcome of the story. Quinto makes for the best Vulcan since Leonard Nimoy, fully understanding not only what it means to be Vulcan but also what it means to be Spock. As James T. Kirk, Chris Pine might be just a bit too rambunctious, but as the film develops, shades of William Shatner emerge, culminating with a scene at the end of the film that's unmistakably Kirk. There's not a bad performance to be found, and more importantly, there's not a badly-interpreted character in the film. This crew meshes about as well as the old crew, and given that this is their first go- round together, it seems destiny has more in store for them than simply one great film.Finally, it's important to note just how strong the production is from top to bottom. J.J. Abrams' visual style fits in wonderfully with the tone, story, and themes of the film, not to mention the approach that nicely compliments the set design. The extensive use of lens flare might distract some, but it reinforces the bright interior of the Enterprise, which also plays in stark contrast to the ugliness of the Romulan vessel and the urgency and sadness that play crucial to the crux of the film. Abrams' approach to the material is respectful and graceful, but also aggressive. In addition, Star Trek's humor never falls flat or overwhelms the picture in any way. In fact, it generally enhances the tone, pace, and urgency of the film and the development of the story and its characters. Star Trek also delivers impeccable special effects. The ship and the action both are superbly realized in the digital realm, and there is no single effect that appears as anything less than perfect. Star Trek is perhaps the current pinnacle of special effects;sheer immersion, attention to detail, and absolute seamlessness, they don't come any better. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's score is elegant, strong, and endearing. Like the film, it enjoys its own identity but listeners familiar with the broad range of music found in the ""Star Trek"" universe will note subtle similarities that allow it to nicely integrate with the works of Alexander Courage, Jerry Goldsmith, Dennis McCarthy, and others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Organic . . . less elegant . . . thrilling!,"Quick spoiler-free review-- I had a difficult time catching my breath for a lot of the film--it IS a thrill-ride. It is a far less elegant Trek than that which I have known up to this point, and it has a very organic feel to it. The tag line of it not being your father's star trek is VERY true. Lots of people will find lots of reasons not to like the film, but I found myself very excited at the idea of getting to know these characters all over again . . . what a thought--how fun will it be to see new situations and interactions. The characters are definitely the characters and are very familiar in comfortable ways. They are also different, and for me at least, the differences work just fine.The effects are stunning. The music is stirring. It is good to see good writing back in Trek again. There are some plot contrivances that are pushing the envelope of suspension of disbelief, but they work to the audience's advantage and help to get our characters in their places so much faster so we can see the story. Overall, the film was a kick!

"Star Trek (2009) is a movie that successfully lives up to the series legacy, but doesn't do much more than that.","I've always loved Star Wars, though not as much today as when I was ten. I've heard about Star Trek my entire life (famous Star Wars rival), even though I had never watched any of it. I already knew the names Kirk and Spock even though I had no idea who they were. I once asked someone where to start in the massive franchise that is Star Trek, and they said that's down to personal taste. I've always been more of a cinema guy, so I started with the 2009 J. J. Abrams directed film.I'm not gonna spend much time describing the plot, because it's not that complex. (That's a complaint if you couldn't tell.) When someone wants to destroy the world, Kirk and Spock attempt to save the galaxy. That's about it, but I do give the movie credit for some good subplots, some of which are very emotional.I'm always an advocate for plot over character (both is obviously better, but if I had to pick one, it would be plot.), ever since I watched John Wayne movie El Dorado (1966), of which director Howard Hawks reportedly said the plot didn't matter, the characters were so good. The movie that followed was one of the worst I ever watched. Star Trek is the first movie I think I've ever seen where the characters made up for the lack of plot. The characters were fairly straightforward and had stereotypical character types, with reckless adventurer Kirk, and quite intellectual Spock. But because of bursts of other personalities and subtle complexities, these characters are more than they seem to be at first. I can only imagine how good the movie would have been if the plot matched the characters. This makes for a good popcorn movie.One thing I couldn't quite get over was that it felt like it was shot like a tv show, which makes sense considering the franchises roots are in television. It doesn't kill the movie, but more cinematic scale could have made for some incredible visuals.This was my first foray into the Star Trek franchise, and I don't regret it. I write about the franchise as a whole, but I've never even seen anything else's from the franchise, I just know how great the Star Trek legacy is. This was a good movie, but it could have been more. In my mind, it doesn't even come close to Star Wars. Unless you plan to watch further into the franchise, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But I may change my mind once I myself get further into the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Parallel Universe?,"CONTAINS SPOILERS.Having seen the original series when it was first aired as a small child, and watched reruns on and off ever since, I went into the threatre with an open mind and came out very happy with what I had seen. I found it fun, exciting and imaginative, with great arcs in the stories of the main characters, and I obviously wasn't the only one who felt this way because the audience in the theatre I attended clapped enthusiastically at the end.I have come to realize over the last forty years that with Star Trek anything can happen, including black holes behaving like worm holes, and the shift in the space-time continuum did not bother me at all, though I was surprised as anyone else at the destruction of Vulcan and the tragic death of Spock's mother. Still I accepted right away that this was opening new roads for ideas as much as Spock and Uhura being a number is, or Scotty being given the equation for trans warp beaming by a Spock from the future.I truly liked getting to see a young Spock's vulnerable human side a bit more than we did in the original series. Then again in the original series episode, The Menagerie, we do see a younger Spock showing this by smiling in a certain scene, and a few other episodes have him expressing some emotions as well. I am very curious to see more of him in what I expect will be future films. I was also glad to see Ben Cross as the choice for Sarek, and found him touching as Spock's logical father who admits he has felt emotions like love.So for those who aren't happy with this new look to Star Trek, I suggest you maybe try to see it as a parallel universe to the original series, where both slight and great differences can exist. Also keep in mind that just because time has been tinkered with doesn't mean the characters from STNG etc. won't exist on this time plane in the future. They just may have some changes in their lives, positive or negative, minor or extreme. Just be imaginative: maybe Jean-Luc Picard will captain the future Enterprise, he'll just have married and divorced, having fathered some children in that time. Maybe Tuvok of STVG - who'd be a child when this story is told - was not on Vulcan when it was destroyed. The same might be said for Ensign Vorek's parents, and they will meet at the Vulcan colony that the elder Spock plans to help build. Maybe Seven of Nine's family will never be assimilated by the Borg, she'll end up joining the Maquee and meet Seska, as well as Chekotay and Bh'lana, that way, and they'll all meet Captain Janeway and the USS Voyager the way the rebel group did in the series.

"Loved, loved, loved this Star Trek movie!!","This movie couldn't have been any more perfect. I seriously can't think of anything I would have changed. The writing was GREAT! The casting was perfect. Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg are amazing! And Karl Urban as McCoy is priceless. Eric Bana made a very convincing villain. The directing was excellent! This movie is what the new Star Wars movies should have been and weren't. From scene one, you're captivated in by the characters (read this, George Lucas: the characters were actually DEVELOPED!), the visuals and the action. All three of those things need to be there for a good sci-fi movie or it won't satisfy. And this one satisfies in a big way.I'm trying not to give spoilers here, so I can't say exactly what happened. But the writers and JJ have created a story line that will keep you immersed in the movie from scene one to the last scene. I LOVED that the central theme was the developing relationship between Kirk and Spock. I'm very familiar with the Trek universe, so I really enjoyed that they put in little shout-outs all over the place to us fans. ""I'm giving her all she's got!"" ""I'm a doctor, Jim, not a physicist!"" LOL But at the same time, they made a movie that non-fans can enjoy as well. My 20-year-old daughter went with me. She's hasn't really watched any of the Star Trek series except maybe an odd episode or two caught on TV, but she loved the movie as well.And can I say that if the role of Sylar on Heroes isn't making Zachary Quinto an actual Hollywood star, his turn as Spock in this movie should do it. His Spock really makes the movie. He completely captures Spock's battle over his human, emotional side and his vulcan, non-emotional side with every little slight change of expression.This may not be your father's Star Trek (as their ad said), but father, son, mother and daughter will all enjoy this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Rebooting the matinée,"Part and parcel of the PR bandwagon for 'Star Trek' were reports of Trekkers (a devotee corrected my previous use of the term 'Trekkie') weeping in the aisles, collapsing in ecstacy etc. at preview screenings. I suppose that's to be expected. It's been a long time since a movie featured the original characters and there was always something slightly antiseptic about the TNG cast and the movies spawned from their series. Such was the pre-release feedback from that constituency I was expecting to be blown away, rather than, as happened, leaving the cinema entertained and engaged, with slight nagging doubts. The most major of these is how cavalierly this reboot rewrites the entire Star Trek universe, details of which, of course, cannot be revealed. It also uses the laziest of sci-fi clichés in order to twist a plot around. When you see the movie you will understand instantly what I mean by this. Otherwise, it's most pleasant aspects are the rich, warm tones of its cinematography and retro stylings when it comes to the likes of uniforms, 'ray guns' and starship interiors which appear to feature copious amounts of pipework. This is as much a homage to an earlier generation of science fiction movies as to the original Star Trek TV series. One irritation is Abrams love of shaky camera work, which sometimes, when combined with overwhelming pyrotechnics makes it difficult to see what's actually going on. This is where JJ Abrams has fixed his vision. The reboot aims at recreating the intimacy of the TV series, dodging behind rocks and acrobatic hand-to-hand combat rather than the 'epic' and cerebral tone introduced by the movies of the 70s and 80s. Unfortunately the plot is not that strong. As in other recent 'reboots' of Batman and Superman, the initial exposition of story drags a little as characters are introduced. I have my doubts as to whether the actors are able to either inhabited these much-loved characters effectively and also give them new life. In this first movie, Spock and Kirk aside, perhaps, they seem to be pale imitations. Simon Pegg's Scotty, especially, was a disappointment. The thing about Star Trek is that it's such an assured franchise, the producers know they can refine and enrich their re-imagined ST universe over several more films, and this one gives them a relatively strong platform to do this from.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing, Orginal and Refreshing","Let's face it, in an age where every older film is being remade and lazily altered slightly, I wasn't for a second expecting this. Absolutely blew my socks off. This film is everything I could ever want from the franchise and more.Not only did they capture the essence of the characters from the original films/series, they added depth and new direction. The old universe is turned on its head and the very well written story keeps you gripped. Kirk and Spock fit very well and the twist on their relationship is woven in so well, you feel like you are watching a brand new sci-fi genre.If ever people wanted to understand the ingredients for a good remake, this is the perfect combo. If you love Star Trek and you hate crap remakes, this is the film for you. Stunningly good, I didn't want the film to end.Great bad guys with a purpose, great good guys not tied to their predecesors and a story that makes you yearn for more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Comment for the Non-Trekkies,"I have never seen an episode of Star Trek in my life and know nothing of previous movies of the show, but decided to tag along with a few friends to see the opening. I am not one to give any spoilers, so simply put, it is a great movie. Star Trek is full of action, great special effects, and scenes of suspense. Not only is it greatly entertaining, but there are laughs throughout. Even with the little knowledge I have of Star Trek, I can confidently say each actor does a superb job carrying their role throughout the film. Star Trek is as easy to follow as it is to enjoy, and you will not be lost if even you are a non-Trekkie. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The quintessential example of a perfect reboot.,"Everything fires on all cylinders, not least of all the electric and amusing acting, some rich kinetic photography, clever callbacks and nuanced emotion.
Perhaps re-tutored the world in how to build artistically presented blockbusters, for a spell anyway.
The film that made Star Trek cool. It was always fun, heartfelt and adventurous, but it wasn't all those things *and* cool.
Abrams manages to make a gripping and fresh and pitch-perfect reboot with an equally pitch perfect cast. We don't see too little or too much of the prequel elements of Star Trek and there are enough clever references that it's not too cloying or befuddling to those new to Star Trek. The timeline altering is just an absolutely perfect idea and there's a real sense of classic movie magic and an ingenious modern spirit injected into this movie that makes it timeless and consistently excellent.
The 4K UHD isn't a huge leap above the blu-ray in terms of image because it was a pretty fine entry as it was, but the sheer contrast between the lights and darks in this movie are eye-popping and colours are strong and nuanced without being overwhelming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pale imitation,"I waited for months before venturing to write a review of this film. This is a Star Trek reboot for an addled and ADHD-suffering modern generation. There is precious-little substance to this film at all apart from the roller coaster ride of effects and (poor) music.Oh the actors did a good enough job...that wasn't the worry. It was the nonsensical and silly script that wrecked it for me. The too-convenient twists and plain hokum plot devices like ""red matter""...red matter???People are jumping up and down and writing that JJ has revived a ""dead"" franchise. Better that it stayed dead than get the JJ ""LOST/FRINGE"" treatment. Gene Roddenberry's ashes would be glowing in anger if he could see this trite nonsense.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
End of the Roddenberrily-Correct Trek!,"I can see how this movie would upset devotees of the vapid Roddenberry/Berman/Piller version of the Star Trek universe. It pretty much puts back all the unforgivable ""mistakes"" and ""flaws"" of the original series that these fans thought Next Gen had ""corrected."" In place of the idealized, mentally-hygienic, practically carved in marble heroes they seem to prefer, it gives us a bunch of weird, violent, sexed-up, imperfect, and very human characters. And it has illogical elements and plot holes - while of course there were none in the ""new, improved"" Trek shows. Let's face it - compared to Next Gen, this movie is a train wreck.The thing is, watching a train wreck - a passenger train at that - is more interesting than watching a train full of people who have no problems rolling smoothly along on perfectly level tracks while discussing the physics of train travel. Which is sort of what watching Next Gen is like.So frankly, despite its flaws, I welcome the new Trek with enthusiasm. It's a mess, but it's a creative, exciting, emotionally-engaging, adventurous mess. If you want to have fun - see this movie now. If not, stay home and watch ""Pen Pals"" a few times. Maybe you'll change your mind about trains.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
totally impressed,"As an original trekker I took exception to some of the trailers and i waited for this movie being somewhat skeptical. BUT, after viewing I must say I was VERY impressed. It was Star Trek at it's core. They were usually over matched and in over their heads, but always found a way to win with wits intelligence and usually some humor. It was a home run all the way around especially in the casting. The original members should be proud of their stand ins. And if you have been a fan as long as me there were nods in the movie from almost all of the Trek pantheon.

The music in this movie seems to have been done as an afterthought, and seems to completely ignore the original opening theme altogether.Given the above comments, I do applaud the producers for wanting to inject some new blood, and really enjoyed watching younger versions of the characters.I still gave it 7 stars because I'm hoping they will improve the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best STAR TREK ever!,"I'm a lifelong Star Trek fan. I grew up in the early 80s watching the adventures of Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones - Star Trek (and Captain Future) made me a true science fiction fan. Then came THE NEXT GENERATION which I even love more. My favorite series is DS9.And now, after a few years, and after the failure of ENTERPRISE, the terrible (and boring) ST: NEMESIS I thought ""this is the end of STAR TREK. Time to bury the franchise."" I would never have thought that someone would be able to reanimate this over 40 year old universe, but they did it! This is the Star Trek I always dreamed of. Full of good action, emotion, fun. In the last years (as much as I loved TNG)it was getting worse and worse).And before some hardcore TOS or TNG fans say I am just for the action: Among my all time favorite episodes are TNG's THE INNER LIGHT, DS9's FAR BEYOND THE STARS and the feature THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. But such episodes worked for TV (I hope TV would be that good nowadays - I don't watch TV since many years now) For the big screen I want action, drama and emotions.

Fantastic Trek,"After seeing the trailer I had high hopes for this new franchise, and it did not let me down. Terrific cast, and a terrific new NCC 1701. The movie had humor, and substance. The characters did there homework, and did a splendid job with the adaptation. Simon Pegg your the man dude. The few complaints are significant enough for me to talk about. Firstly the space action sequences are way to fast for you to absorb. They need to slow this amazing cgi down so you can actually see what's happening. this is also a problem with transformers.

Completely entertaining; a great afternoon at the movies!,"This is a perfect example of movie-making as a team effort. Everyone brought something special to the party, worked their behinds off, and went home exhausted from all the effort. JJ Abrams and the rest of the cast and crew can be proud of what they've accomplished here.I remember watching Star Trek on NBC as a teenager during the show's original seasons. As I grew older, however, the Kirk/Spock/etc reruns and movies grew somewhat boring (except ST-IV, ""Save the Whales"").The Next Generation show was wonderful as it finally decided to take itself a bit more seriously and had story lines that were more adult. However, with the exception of ""First Contact"", these ""TNG"" movies weren't very good.But now along comes JJ Abrams and tries to do what was supposed to be impossible: Resurrect the Star Trek franchise.You know what? He's done it. I brought my son along (who was born when TNG first aired on TV). We had a wonderful time. The actors who inhabit Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chechov, etc. bring just enough of the old '60's Star Trek along for the ride yet are confident enough to put their own imprint on these cultural icons (and the director is confident enough to let them). The interaction among the characters was a hoot. This builds the characters anew yet, because of some deft direction and crisp writing, lets us older fans feel comfortable.What about the plot? From beginning to end, it's pretty much a non-stop roller-coaster ride. Suspend your sense of disbelief (it's Sci-Fi, remember?) and simply go with the flow. You won't be disappointed.Perhaps we'll have time in future Star Trek films to really flesh out the rest of the cast. I look forward to them.I have -no- complaints about this re-boot of Star Trek. See it on the big screen and sit so the screen fills your entire field of vision. This is Hollywood at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not worthy of the top 250,"This movie did a lot of things right and will probably win a lot of awards because of it. But I don't think it's worthy of the top 250 here at IMDb, not even close.First off, the CGI and direction in general was great. A lot of people including myself were stunned by the gigantic explosions and sweeping shots of gargantuan space ships hurdling through space. The only problem I had with the directing was the liberal use of the shaky cam during action scenes... a pet peeve of mine.I'll also briefly mention the acting was pretty good and I didn't really see any weak link in the cast. I especially found Spock's whole inner struggle very believable.Unfortunately, at about the halfway point of the movie, after getting accustomed to the unreal space battles I started paying attention to the story, and that's where it all went down-hill. The plot is riddled with many uses of the 'deus ex machina'. At the heart of every problem (and indeed, solution!) lies either a black hole, or far-fetched one-in-a-trillion coincidence. This would be even slightly bearable, if the writers had done any research on black holes whatsoever. Alas, scientific inaccuracies abound making poor physicists like me cringe in their seats.OK, so maybe the scientific inaccuracies escape most people. But it doesn't matter. There are other glaring flaws in the movie. Once we know who the bad guys are and how to solve the problem (again, at about the halfway point of the movie), other things like smart dialog and character development get completely pushed aside to make room for neat explosions, unbearable one-liners and a corny motivational speech or two. In short, Star Trek goes from a fantastic movie to an average action flick.So, to summarize, Star Trek did a lot of things right, but it wasn't without its mistakes too. I've focused more on the mistakes here because most people seem to think this is one of the best movies ever made, which I can not at all agree with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Made me like star trek,"I should start off by saying that sense I was a boy, the name even saying the words ""star trek"" made me feel like a nerd. My parents were trekies in their day, and I wanted no part of it. You can imagine my low expectations when I was pressured into seeing this movie. I really don't know how J.J. Abrams did it, but I left with - at the very least - an appreciation of star trek. Even in flashbacks of Kirk's childhood, the kid who played him was a splendid actor (and I normally HATE child actors). I would definitely recommend it to my friends... I mean, i still feel a little awkward talking about that forbidden nerdom of star trek, but this movie made me like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Warp Factor 10!,"I have to admit, I was completely skeptical of this film. I enjoyed Alias, but it got a bit stale and cheesy towards the end. I tried to watch Lost, but it didn't move me, then JJ came along with 6 degrees which was a departure from his Sci-Fi roots and it was an incredible show that was cut far to soon from the ABC schedule.I was not impressed with Mission Impossible 3 and didn't even consider spending a penny on Cloverfield. Fringe is amazing TV and possibly the best Sci Fi on TV since X-Files.It's because JJ and his Fringe staff stepped up to the plate here that I spent my dollar. This movie was amazing. Short of an early sequence of a 10 year old Kirk, I enjoyed the film. I think the actors paid an amazing homage to the original stars and JJ and writers managed to bring a great amount of conflict, struggle and drama to the screen while maintaining the comedy and action from the best of this series.This film has turns you never see coming and manages to bring you up to date on characters in a single film. This is not your fathers or grandfathers Trek, but that's a good thing. Much like Dark Knight, they finally got it right. I'm not a Treker, Trekie or anything to that account. Just a guy who loves movies and I can say well done indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fascinating rebirth of a classic,"J. J. Abrams brings his unique writing to a classic franchise. With Star Trek, he takes by far the most influential sci-fi series of all time and dons a Jedi cloak to reinvent the franchise with more grit, grime, and guts than the classic fare.Always with my friends was the question, which is better Star Trek or Star Wars, as Abrams claims he was never into Star Trek, I was expecting a darker, more one-dimensional Star Trek - and that is what I got. Even the music had dynamic horns and choir voices reminiscent of John Williams, except for a few scenes. Overall this will not have the same feel as any of the other movies, with the exception of the brutal Wrath of Khan - which we all know was the best of the Star Trek films - until now. Yes, I just said that, deal with it! I keep hearing, this isn't your father's Star Trek, no, it isn't - this is my son's Star Trek, and you know what - I am glad. I can keep my dad's Star Trek on the shelf and dust it off and wax nostalgic over days gone by, or I can engage to full warp and embrace this bold new interpretation on the classic. No reason they can't coexist.Star Trek opens up with action almost immediately and only applies the dampeners a few times to fill in compelling story lines that will have you sympathetic to new and familiar characters. Telling the tale of the heroic James Tiberius Kirk and his quick advances through Star Fleet Academy, Chris Pine and Jimmy Bennett both enter the legend's boots, with dramatic success.Zachary Quinto and Jacob Kogan both play the pointy-eared bastard, Dr. Spock as he carves out his own destiny by joining Star Fleet Academy against the Vulcan Science Academy's wishes. Spock is himself a child of two worlds, and is constantly struggling with fitting in wholly anywhere. Logic and science are his guide, while emotions of helplessness persistently haunt his thoughts.Zoe Saldana plays the vixen du jour, Nyota Uhura - yet another member of S.F.A. Russian born Anton Yelchin naturally assumes the stammering Pavel Chekov with a few chuckle-worthy scenes, but by far my favorite character, then as now is Bones, Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban). Urban brought a smile to my face as I swear the original DeForest Kelley possessed his body from wherever great souls reside when they reach that Final Frontier. Simon Pegg managed to effectively resurrect another missed old-friend, Scotty - who of course delivered his most famous line, no doubt Pegg insisted on that, can't say I blame him one bit.These actors not only held their own, they owned these legendary characters masterfully, let's face it, it is simply impossible to fill the shoes of the unique William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Pine's style and charisma comes across as genuine machismo and charm, he even gets to smooch a green-hottie, no doubt he insisted on that, can't say I blame him either. Not to be outdone, Quinto clearly has some green blood pumping through his veins. The two worked so well together in certain scenes, you forget this is just a couple of actors on the screen, you feel a certain tulpa has been created in the theater. Wonderful job guys; don't let any Trekkies tell you otherwise.The casting was superb, kudos to all involved - whatever late night calls were placed at the last minute to pull this cast together, however much sleep was lost wondering if you got that right someone for the part - know ya' done good, folks.It's hard to write this review in my typical non-spoiler fashion, so I will wait until I get some intense debate going here. I really must admit, I was so drawn into this movie, this story, the adventure, that I couldn't find one fault anywhere. And I gave this 6 stars because I can, I have the con - so to speak.If you don't agree that this movie deserves the Blockbuster of the year, I guess you are just too hung up on the changes from the original concepts, the twists that make no sense to the uber-purists, but everything is accounted for in this film, no plot holes can be surmised because of the genius of J. J. Abrams. Let's not despise the fresh changes, let's embrace them as new Trekkies are recruited to boldly go where no man has gone before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Mc Star Trek,"There's a lot I could write about this new version of Star Trek.

However Star Trek 2009 takes the quick and easy path for all of these.It's painfully obvious from the first 10 minutes of this film that it is targeted squarely at teenagers and young adults. All semblance of an intelligent and intriguing plot or deep character development is absent. Even internal consistency is thrown out the window. Plot holes aplenty and a complete lack of adherence to the core ideas of Star Trek are visible at every turn.Imagine Star Trek by Jerry Bruckheimer.

"Chris Pine, your mouth is ajar...","I really wanted to love this movie, and after hearing many great reviews from friends and acquaintances i readied myself for a killer ride. I'll put it this way: You know how a great ride at an amusement park can be ruined by the wrong person sitting next to you? That's kind of how i feel about having Chris Pine portray James Kirk. First off, his voice has an almost cartoonish sound to it, kind of like ""Shaggy"" in the original Scooby Doo. Additionally, while most of the other actors go out of their way to infuse the soul of the original actor into their portrayals, Pine gives no effort whatsoever to do the same for William Shatner. The only thing he shares with Shatner is the tendency to overact. Every scene seems just a little too far over the top, whether it's for the sake of comedy or for the sake of drama. This guy seems out of his league in this role. The rest of the crew is well cast for the most part, even though Simon Pegg as ""Scotty"" also goes a little overboard at times. McCoy (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zac Quinto) are great, and Zoe Saldana as ""Uhura"" is a fox and plays an extremely sexy geek. She steals the scene whenever she's on camera. Eric Bana is a tremendous villain, and it's a testament to his acting that i didn't even realize it was him at first.It seems to me that CG special effects have gotten to the point where I almost tune them out nowadays; the over-the-top action combined with predictable conclusions make some of these fight sequences almost tedious. I guess back in the day when they had model builders and cameramen who were struggling to get the shots, a sharper editorial sense was needed, and this was a bonus for the films in most cases. Nowadays it seems they trivialize the action by having too many things occur simultaneously, or by having things occur which are too far-fetched, and break you out of your suspension of disbelief.Overall, it is a fun movie with lots of great action and some pretty good acting, but Chris Pine just spoiled it for me. From his voice to his mouth always hanging wide open as he searches for oxygen to feed his enormous dome (one fitting moment has Uhura referring to him as ""the mouth-breather""), the ride just wasn't as fun with him overacting next to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Nutshell Review: Star Trek,"My adventures with the original William Shatner-led Enterprise crew had been confined to the cinematic movies of Star Trek, plus sporadic episodes from the original television series. I grew up more with Patrick Stewart's Captain Jean-Luc Picard commanding the Next Generation on board the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D in exploring strange new worlds and civilizations, as well as every movie made following that crew. It's quite unfortunate that Nemesis didn't fare too well at the box office, and hence it took this long (some 7 years!) before another Star Trek movie got made.In between we had other spin off series like Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise, all which somehow didn't appeal to me, and their ability to cross over to the cinematic screen was, I guess, questionable. Then the question of how and where does one even begin in making another mass appeal movie, which by now has a whole wealth of content, and canonical ones at that. Imagine an established franchise with fans worldwide, some practically religious followers, and convince them that what you're making, and a reboot at that (horrors!) would be the right way forward?But I got to take my hands off to J.J. Abrams, and especially to the scribes of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for really having the balls, and the smarts, to do what they did. It's a reboot all right, but a really clever way to jump-start a legacy without making a mockery of its rich history, providing an acceptable (though not never seen before) method relying on stuff that science fiction is made up of. Of course I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to find out yourself, suffice to say that it made everything fall in place, with the involvement of Leonard Nimoy, and the background of the Romulan villain played to stereotypical perfection by Eric Bana.At its core, with this reboot, it allowed for the film to establish the paralleled and troubled background of the ship's Captain and First Officer, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) and Vulcan Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), and with all solid partnerships and friendships, they too don't begin seeing eye to eye. It's a little bit curious though that this version of Star Trek has forgone its television roots for the cinematic debut first, and even though both Pine and Quinto came from TV, I don't expect to see this particular film spin off a television franchise of its own (though I'm secretly hoping so!). If anything, there should be an ongoing series (if box office receipts permit) for the cinema instead of the gogglebox.It takes a while to showcase these individual characters at the top of the Enterprise command, before we get to see the rest of the familiar crew, now replaced with fresh faces, like John Cho as Sulu, Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Anton Yelchin as Mr Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Simon Pegg as Scotty, whom fans will have to wait until the mid way point to see his very limited, though memorable appearance on the deck of the ship. Since it's an ""origin"" film of sorts, we get more acquainted to Spock, who now demonstrates more emotions rather than cold logic from the Nimoy era, and Kirk still rolling with the punches as the action-hero man, still defiant and often unorthodox in his approach to the mission at hand. Fans itching to see what James T. Kirk is famous for, you'll finally get to see that in his Starfleet Academy days here.The pacing of the film was as energetic as that of its younger cast, and what is a 126 minute movie did feel as if it's under 90 minutes, where it begins with a bang from the get go, and never decelerates from its warp speed. Abrams kept the pace very fluid, balancing emotional scenes with the more action-packed ones, though I feel there would be some passing pre- mature judgement that Star Trek is never about the action. That's true here as well (except probably when you're faced with Kirk hanging on a ledge of some sorts no less than 3 times), in case you're wondering about the trailer's bells and whistles. The sound design was excellent as well, as you really get to experience that silence of space each time the vast void comes to fill up the entire screen.Non-fans might find some reason to scoff at Star Trek being a bit stiff, but this version makes it all sexy again. There's a wonderful story that doesn't pander to the audience nor disrespect its rich history, perfectly fused moments of humour, adequate action, and that core story of how the Enterprise crew got together for its maiden mission, and primed for more when the end credits roll. And it's just nostalgic to see the good 'ol USS Enterprise NCC-1701 given a facelift by Industrial Light and Magic, and taking flight again!Definitely highly recommended, for fans who will be smiling from ear to ear when spotting little gizmos and easter eggs from knowledge of hindsight, and non-fans alike, who would likely be converted and inspired to go dig through the video archives for the original missions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Bout time someone cared enough to make great Trek **Spoilers**,"**Possible Spoilers**So, yesterday I looked online to see the show times for Trek and lo, the theater I was going to had not only a midnight showing but a 7 and 9:30 PM showing as well for Thursday. Giddy as hell, I asked my boss, pleaded practically, to let me go be a geek for the evening. Afraid that my fellow geeks you descend upon the theater in droves, I got there six hours early and purchased tickets for both the 7 and 9:30 shows. With hours to kill, I watched 17 Again, which was pretty dern good, I even got a tickle in my nose there at the end. But anywaySince learning that there was going to be a new Trek film, the geek portion of my life has been filled with nervous anticipation and sitting there in that seat was the culmination of all that worry and trepidation. The lights dimmed, trailers rolled by and It took me a moment to realize that the fist frames were of a ship flying by at close range. Radio chatter. Faran Tahir walks onto a dimly lit bridge. Hey, Hey that's the guy from Iron Man! Thus starts an absolute thrill ride where for the next 2 hours I am pulled back into a universe I had invested countless hours in but had never quite been satisfied with.JJ and crew have done what I wish Berman and even Roddenberry had done. He has taken this franchise and breathed new life into it. There was an engaging story AND eye candy. I have always believed that the actors of the various shows and the fans and maybe a few writers were the only ones to truly care for the universe of Trek. The rest were money grubbing turds. Yes, even Roddenberry. (**gasp**) He gave birth to the idea and for that I will be forever grateful but even he fell into greed. But that's just my opinion.I could go on and on about the actors performances. I'll keep it short by simply saying that all of them were fantastic. Even Anton Yelchin, who I had heard was a bit annoying in his interpretation of Chekov but there were a few times when I swear I could hear Walter Koenig. And if Zoe can move me with just a few lines, I greatly anticipate seeing more from that woman. And Spock beat the snot out of Kirk. Not gimmicky looking punches but a very brutal, visceral attack. Like I said, I could go on and on. One more thing, for those who think Simon Pegg was the comic relief, I think Chris Pine held his own on that point. ""Wellnot only."" HA! Classic.The story. Yes, I've heard from a few die hards that the story failed on many points. I very much disagree, though there were a few holes. I do feel they should have spent a bit more time on Nero's character. As well as explained the whole time/alternate universe thing. Don't get me wrong. I got it. Personally I don't think it's that hard a concept to grasp but I'm looking at it from a non fans point of view. I read the Countdown story so I had the background but more of that should have been in the film. Eric Bana kinda got shortchanged on there. Someone asked the question, ""Where the hell was the rest of Starfleet?"" Well, they were in the Lorench (?) system or something. But still, a few defenses around Vulcan and Earth were in order. The only thing the bothered me, being military and all, was Kirk going from cadet to Captain in a few days, but hey, it was still a damn good story and a great first film.About the eye candy. Yes, there was quite a bit but it was so beautiful in execution. Damn did they do a great job. It never took over. Okay, maybe once when the Enterprise came outta warp behind Titan (Hope y'all caught that nod). But it was a glorious shot. Perfect. And speaking of the new E, oh boy did she grow on me. To quote, ""I'd love to get my hands on her ample nacelles."" The visuals helped tell the story and except in that very necessary instance never became more important than that story. Understand, I watched the movie twice. The first was to get the googily eyes out of the way, the second to look at it a bit more critically. I might have failed a bit in that attempt, but like I said, this film is platinum. Oh! I didn't say that yet. Oh well, now I did.I give this film ten stars, or two and a half thumbs up, or four outta four, or whatever, despite it's few flaws, for one simple reason. Everyone, even the dreaded Paramount and CBS powers that be (even if not for altruistic reasons) gave a damn about this universe and the characters. For a long time Trek fan (note: not FANatic) it's very refreshing. To actually care about what you are putting your name on. Imagine that!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visuals Will Leave You Stunned.,"By far Star Trek is the greatest movie adventure of all time. The story of Star Trek and its Enterprise crew should be well known by now, but in case you were hiding in a cave... The Enterprise is a starship from Earth's 25 century and the crew's mission is to seek out new life and to boldly go where no man has gone before. Way back in the day, 1966, came the Star Trek television series. Then in 1979 came Star Trek The Motion Picture. Now in 2009 we have Star Trek which follows those original characters of Captain Kirk and the Vulcan Spock, only this time we're getting a fresh new batch of actors.This film allows us to explore Kirk and Spock before they have become their legendary selves. We meet James Kirk and learn how he was challenged from his home in Iowa into joining Starfleet, equivalent to our NASA today. We meet Spock who is tortured between his Vulcan heritage and his human nature and emotions. The other characters also come into our view for ""the first time"" and even though the actors faces are fresh the characters are very familiar. This is quite a challenge to the actors playing them and an equal challenge to real fans of the series who have embedded themselves and love of the characters with those original actors.For Trek fans you're going to love this movie. It is fresh yet familiar. There is lots of new material here to keep you going for two hours. It is great to see this reboot of the characters and see them unfold from the beginning again. You'll love seeing Spock and Kirk save the galaxy for the first time. However, also for Trek fans the reboot isn't going to be able to follow every reference or look and act the same as it did in 1966 or 1979. When the series first rebooted itself with the 1979 release, little was thought about making everything match the t.v. series – thank god. It worked great. So hopefully Trek fans will see the choices made in 2009 as reasonable ones.For normal movie goers this film is a marvel of modern CGI and everything looks so real that it is hard to believe that it is not real. It is a gorgeous looking film and that is hard to argue. J.J. Abrams, the film's director has done a remarkable job in getting this project off the ground and also pulling this movie together considering the special effects. It's almost like pulling a movie out of thin air. Just as the model making was incredible in the earlier films it is the computer imaging that makes this movie look breathtaking.The acting in the film is a bit uneven and unbalanced. The actors certainly had enough reference material to pull from and while I wasn't looking for any type of impersonations from the actors, the characters are pretty much set in stone from the books and previous movies. This might be where Trek fans are most critical. From a non Trek point of view, the development could have been much deeper that it was. One of the surprise performances comes from Simon Pegg who plays Scotty, the ship's engineer. His delivery and skill takes many of the scenes that he is in.As fir Chris Pine (James Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), their chemistry together has a certain flair, but the spark never ignites fully. They play their parts very light without letting themselves go too deep into these characters. The tension of friendship is there but at times I just wasn't convinced that these guys had the bravado necessary to save the galaxy. If their chemistry doesn't do it for you, don't worry. There is still some sexiness to this geeky film. Just like its predecessors, this film finds a way to work in some sex appeal.I am forced to admit that I am a Trek fan. Therefor I like the movie. I think I'm able to be unbiased enough though to say that non-Trek fans will like this movie too. It is a great sci- fi ride with some awesome graphics, great fighting, some twists and turns and all around good fun. If you're not a fan this movie just might make a fan of you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Kinetic, Subtle, Multi-Layered Masterpiece","Bravo and kudos all around- J.J. Abrams has taken the fetid clay of a rotting entertainment franchise and fashioned a breathtaking, stand-alone, beautiful film.It is not only the visual, non-stop cinematic intrepidness of this enterprise, but the glorious production value, the actors who you truly feel researched and understood the nuances of the Star Trek story as well as their individual character(s), and the experienced editing/sound quality that contribute to this film's greatness.It will be very hard to top. Hopefully this isn't the capstone of Roddenberry's intellectual brainchild, but it certainly may be...ROUNDS OF LOUD, LOUD APPLAUSE! The creators and visionaries and consumers of science fictional exploration would be, and are, very proud.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
WOW!,"Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night. Until we meet again, ""Live long and Prosper!""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easy to enjoy.,"Let me get my negative thoughts out of the way first: I was perturbed by the choice the creators of this film made regarding its odd relationship with the series (And the previous films). If you're familiar with Star Trek, you'll know what I mean. Once or twice during the film, I thought ""Wait, this can't be right..."" until I realized the unusual approach the filmmakers chose. In my opinion, it was a bad creative choice.Despite that, I liked the movie quite a bit. If you aren't too familiar with Star Trek, you won't even notice the oddities. And in any case, the end product is a decent story, told with excitement and style.I estimate that those behind the film were striving to make this acceptable to almost everyone, rather than trying to blow anyone's mind. They succeeded, as I can't imagine many people who wouldn't enjoy Star Trek. If you're a bitter hipster who only watches black & white films with just enough plot to deliver a sad ending, you probably weren't thinking about going to see this anyway. Everyone else, have fun!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but not on the same level as Roddenbury,"(2009) Star Trek
SCIENCE- FICTIONPrequel, sequel and reboot of the original TV series except with a much younger cast, better looking weapons and more powerful space ships! What this movie did well on is what the Star Wars prequels failed to do, and they did it without the creator Gene Roddenbury whose long been gone! Somewhat of a confusing plot involving the people of Earth, Romulans and the Vulcans! The only thing this movie didn't do too well on are the personality traits of the original cast which include Spock and Uhura showing some affection with each other. This is probably the best rating I can give it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is Star Trek People,"After years of telling people why I like Trek they can see a film that puts the original series into full light.Star Trek follows the creation of the greatest crew to explore the far reaches of space. The opening scenes show us a dramatic and moving battle between the USS Kelvin and the time displaced ship Nerada. This battle introduces the villain Nero (Eric Bana) and shows us the birth of James Kirk. Jump ahead 25 years and we see Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) take two different paths to Starfleet and the adventure to stop the vengeance filled Nero begin.Lets start with the amazing story. The script perfectly captured the characters, drama, terror, and passion of the franchise. One scene at the beginning of the film was so moving I had tears in my eyes. Just the beginning reveals the quality of what is in store for old Trek fans and the new ones to come.Star Trek does an amazing job of capturing everything that makes Star Trek brilliant. Being a crazed fan since childhood I tell you this film communicated all the qualities that make Star Trek great. While us Trekies get our fill the film does not turn off new fans and in fact shows them the charm and beauty of this franchise (if I had a buck for every non-Trek fan friend who has asked to borrow my DVDs). Gone are the things that weighed down the last three Trek series (techno babble, the need for a deep understanding of TOS and TNG, etc.).The actors were brilliant perfectly capturing each character. I seriously felt like I was meeting old friends after years of their absence. Chris Pine was smart in not trying to imitate Shatner but was still able to show some of Shatners Kirk mannerisms. Quinto had a tough job in the film considering that Nimoy was also in the film. Even with this mirror image Quinto played Spock perfect. Nero was a fantastic villain providing us with a great excuse for a restart.The special effects are beyond description. The sheer beauty of it all was to much to take in on the first showing. Lucas needs to take lessons from these guys.If you have not seen this film you must. Heck, it is probably hitting dollar theaters soon so no excuses.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wonderfully ridiculous!,"This latest Star Trek offering is completely ridiculous. And incredibly wonderful! I'm not sure how people who aren't familiar with Star Trek will react because they'll miss the myriad references to elements of previous shows and movies, but those who've seen the classic TV series will have tremendous amounts of fun. Over and over again throughout the movie I kept asking myself ""How is he doing this?"" Meaning, how is the director managing to both make fun of and deeply appreciate Star Trek at the same time. There is both strong emotional connection to the characters and great campiness every minute of the movie. The only thing I found slightly off-putting was the casting. I would sometimes get distracted from the film as I tried to identify the face hidden behind a thin layer of alien makeup. If you're any kind of Star Trek fan at all treat yourself to two hours of fun and go see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Takes me back to Star Wars in 1977!,"This really was a pleasure of a film. Abrahms has plotted a course that manages to get the balance of engrossing action and entertainment just right.And entertainment is something that has been missing from the SciFi genre for a while. I'm just about old enough to have experienced Star Wars in the cinema in 1977. The feeling of seeing your imagination (as opposed to what some focus-group *think* people like) up there on-screen can't be beaten.There is a scene on a snowy planet that is very reminiscent of Star Wars' Hoth - not in plot terms of course, but in the way it carries the viewer with the hero and the odds he faces. And another aboard the Romulan ship that conjures up the feelings of watching Mr. Skywalker battling for his life in ""Revenge of the Jedi"". This is just for comparison of course - the film is very confident in it's own universe, and Star Trek's fantastic range of characters and history is used to full (and respectful) effect here.The design-work involved is top notch too. Influences from the original TV series are everywhere and the realism of 2001: A Space Oddysey is evoked also. The fight scenes are orchestrated so that they don't just feel like set-pieces, but real action moments.The only slight gripe for me was Scotty. When I heard Simon Pegg was playing him I though it sounded like perfect casting. But I think his performance was hammed up too much for ""comic effect"" - and it didn't work. It was all the more apparent given the rest of the cast's believable performances as young versions of the classic cast. But we can forgive Mr. Pegg. As anyone who has seen the excellent series Spaced will know, his SciFi fan credentials are above reproach! All in all an excellent film that stays true to what makes Science Fiction on film one of the most compelling experiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A different, but great take on the Star Trek concept","Based on the trailers and all the talk prior to the release of this movie, I already knew that this Star Trek would be different than others and that I had to change my expectations accordingly and watch this movie as a slight different take on Star Trek as we knew it.I did and I was not disappointed. One person here said it was Star Trek on steroids and I totally agree. The pace is faster, action scenes are more intense, Ships and battles have a more greatness about them and most characters seem a bit more natural instead of utopian.While older Star Trek movies often seemed like a rather lengthy episode and seemed that they were filled with obsolete scenes just to make it long enough to call it a motion picture, this new Star Trek gives you the satisfaction of watching an action-packed movie which doesn't allow you to fall asleep of boredom.Special Effects are absolutely stunning. Go see them for yourself.The acting is quite good. The three main characters (Spock, Kirk & bones) are very convincing and well cast. I especially enjoyed Karl Urban as Bones. Simon Pegg also did a good job on Scotty. I found him to be very amusing. Only Chekov and Sulu didn't really impress me (I never liked Sulu anyway), but they only played a minor part in the movie.The movie has some downsides however: - Due to the fast pace of the movie, some characters are introduced too fast to get really acquainted with them. - Villain (Eric Bana as 'Nero') is pretty generic. Although I like Eric Bana and he believe he did a decent job with the means he had. I think this character lacks some needed depth.And of course there are some issues concerning the old star trek universe and this new (Chekov, who actually was still a little kid in the old star trek time-line) and the general discussion why such a reboot was necessary.But if you let all those things go, then Star Trek XI is a great movie.It's like comparing Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings to the original book by Tolkien. If you see the original as holy, then the new take will disappoint you and leave you frustrated, but if you see them as 2 different takes on the same story/concept, then you'll find them equally enjoyable.I like both LOTR's as I learned to separate one from the other and enjoy the good things of both and now I am doing the same with Star Trek.This movie has rekindled the Trekkie in me and I am looking forward to a sequel",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I felt like each one of the actors respected these characters deeply and cared for them as if it were the greatest honor in the world to play them.Chris Pine channeled William Shatner and I swear that Zachary Quinto and Leonard Nimoy are related somehow. McCoy was awesome and Scotty? Wow. Just not enough Scotty though. Uruha. Such a GREAT update to her character while staying true to it.I loved the nods to favorite episodes and even the style of the bad guy music was reminiscent of the old battle scenes in the original series.

Great incarnation of the Sci-fi phenomena.,"Both Kirk's and Spock's future is altered when a revengeful Romulan travels back through time changing the destiny of the star-ship Enterprise forever.J.J. Abrams incarnation of the phenomena known as Star Trek, wisely sticks closed to the spirit, look and fun of the original TV series. It follows the young James T. Kirk and his fellow USS Enterprise crew-members as they battle in space against a time travelling alien species.With a star studded cast including Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, funny man Simon Pegg, reliable Karl Urban, and the exquisite Zoe Saldana as Uhura, it really is a pleasure to watch.If you've never seen Star Trek it doesn't matter as the story can be viewed as a stand alone sci-fi adventure film.

Through the eyes of a young boy.......,"I remember watching Kirk, Spock and McCoy when I was a young boy sat on the carpet in our living room at the feet of my father, I loved it, every week it was a new tale of how the crew of the enterprise took on new dangers and met new races of people on strange planets. I remember vividly the Carbon based life form in one episode and the Tribbles that ate the poisonous grain giving away the sinister Klingon's dastardly plot in another but above all this, it was a tale about a group of friends dealing with each others emotions in different stressing circumstances and situations. This is something that was lost a little when The Next Generation came along, don't get me wrong though, I liked TNG a lot but it never impressed me as much as the original series mainly due to the fact that it centred to much on the technology and science behind what was going on rather than how it effected the people.As the end credits started to roll on the new movie I couldn't stop a tear rolling down my cheek as all the memories of being a young boy watching the original series flooded back to me. I realised that the last 120 minutes I had witnessed had surpassed my expectations ten fold and that the actors had played their parts as the respective crew members perfectly, Karl Urban as 'Bones' probably my favourite re-visioning. Now Im sure the plot was fantastical and hard to believe for some people, yes, but then I cannot remember an episode of any star trek that wasn't a little silly, scientists are finding new ways to explain things every day so who is too say what can or cannot happen in this screwed up universe we call home you just need to have an open mind. All I can say is that Kirk sleeps with an alien woman, gets into a few fist fights and saves the day. Spock uses logic to explain things, argues with McCoy and wrestles with his human emotions and McCoy says 'Damn it' more than once and uses the word 'Vulcan' to address Spock instead of his name. Everything I remember from the series and following films.I came out of the cinema feeling like I had not seen a new star trek movie but had actually seen a new extended episode of the original series and I have to say I will never be the same.

"So it Doesn't EXACTLY preserve canon, STILL A GREAT FILM","As a hardcore Trekkie of 15 years (I own every movie and every season of every show), I was VERY skeptical when I heard Paramount was going to reboot the Original Series with new actors. I went into the film last night ready to dislike it if I feel it didn't live up to expectations.Luckily, my fears were most DEFINITELY misplaced. J.J. Abrams's ""Star Trek"" is a roller coaster thrill of a ride that Trekkies and even NON-Trekkies are sure to enjoy.I don't want to give away the plot of the film, but suffice it to say, it preserves the best parts of Original Series canon while introducing new twists and turns into Trek lore. I found myself not bored for a single second during this film, which is unique, as I feel there are parts in the other ""Trek"" films that seem to drag on and become a bit tedious.The new cast SHINES in their roles, keeping the best characteristics of the original characters while making them their own. I especially enjoyed Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and Karl Urban as McCoy. I would go in to more detail, but I encourage EVERYONE to go see this film for themselves.

This film reminds us how fun & cool the original crew really were!,"Even though this new Star Trek movie is a prequel; its an updated look into its universe as it also pays a lot of respect to the original television series and its characters. You'll recognize a lot of the famous quotes and mannerisms from the famous crew. Some of the events in the film may even seem familiar, as they are mentioned in the original series and its earlier movies.The problem that I did have with this film is that it deals with some of its characters that are not in the same time-line, which means that certain Star Trek history has been altered. In other words, there are now continuity errors that involves with the original series and movies. I felt that it was just an excuse to gather all the original crew together for this particular film and it gives the filmmakers the freedom to alter the Star Trek history for their future sequels.Overall, it was a very enjoyable Star Trek film that reminds us how fun & cool the original crew really were. This is the movie that will regenerate the popularity of Star Trek again for the 21st Century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"OMG!  I ain't a Trekkie, but as a movie buff, this was an AWESOME re-boot","I headed into this movie with relatively high expectations, because the trailers were awesome...As the movie started, my wife, friends and I were treated to an awesome intro that reminds me of those cool James Bond intros in terms of impact... and it helps set-up the rest of the movie, and we eventually understand that it sets aside a series of events that makes it different from the original Star Trek crew's experiences as people (or Trekkies, I should say) know it.After the intro, it was off to Star Trek Redux, as we saw how the principal players, James T. Kirk and Spock, as well as the rest of the original USS Enterprise crew, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, Bones and even Scotty later on, came together.Generally, the storyline is quite excellent, the action and special effects were state of the art, and I think the director JJ Abrams paced it well while the actors were generally well cast. With exception for a scene or two with Karl Urban (Bones) when I felt he was overacting to simulate the character of Dr Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, all the cast members performed admirably in the shoes of their predecessors who began this quest in 1966. Chris Pine is a perfect impetuous and brave James T. Kirk, while he is opposed and complemented by Zachary Quinto, who is a very good selection as Spock (though he has sinister looks that remind me of his character Sylar on Heroes, like he was going to chop the top of your head off... hahaha). THe other actors also come together pretty well, Zoe Saldana as the long legged Uhura, Karl Urban as a serious and sometimes-not-intending-to-be funny, ""Run Fatboy Run's"" funny Simon Pegg, ""Harold and Kumar's"" John Cho, and a very young Chekov played by Anton Yelchin. Coolness.The storyline, though complex at first glance, as there are time-space continuum (whatever) factors to it, allowed us to accept this re-boot, meaning there was logic to it. Though there are some elements that Trekkies will surely hate (a romantic thing that was not in the original series springs to mind), I hope that they forgive certain liberties taken by the new writers (JJ and his crew from Lost) as it is a worthy part of the Star Trek family.I don't consider myself a hard core or even part-time Trekkie (though I grew up as a fan of Next Gen), but I believe this story will appeal to Trekkies, and non-Trekkies alike. As long as you love to watch movies and sci fi flicks, this is the story and movie for you. It left me with a good feeling after I finished the movie as it was simply awesome. I empathized with the crew as they experienced difficulties and also expressed feelings of triumph when they achieved success.I am so looking forward to more Star Trek flicks to come. Lock in JJ Abrams for 5 more sequels, please! He's the best!Enjoy you guys!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spunk meets Spock,"What do you do with a franchise that has been milked dry? You stage a prequel, or, in other words, a childhood-and-youth-of-the-hero movie. J.J. Abrams' aim in this simply-titled entry is to show how James Kirk and Mr. Spock got to be running the spaceship Enterprise. The non-Trekkie must approach with trepidation this dramatic effort to freshen up the hallowed TV series and its not-so-successful movie avatars. Is it enough to say it's beautiful and entertaining, but lacks something? What happens is a big battle to trounce an evil guy who's destroying whole planets, and some background on the young Spock and Kirk. The substance is simple: Spock's logical, alright, but he's also deeply emotional. Kirk's a testosterone-soaked bad boy, but he's got just the balance of smarts and derring-do to be a great leader.Beyond that, this 'Star Trek' reboot is a dazzlingly pretty audio-visual experience, maybe the closest a lot of moviegoers will ever come to abstract art. It's geometric abstraction: though we're whirling around the galaxies, mostly what we see is space ships with their angles and curves. The early sequences are well balanced and fun, despite an opening that follows the typical but inexplicable blockbuster theory that you should hit 'em with all you've got in the first ten minutes. This 25-years-older flashback showing how daddy Kirk was captain of the Enterprise for a few minutes and saved 800 people while his wife was giving birth on board to the future James Kirk, is ridiculously loud and impulsive and confusing, and when it is clear, it seems corny as all heck. Anyway, mile-a-minute openings' may grab the viewer, but you can never keep up to that level. The only reliable result is that you've numbed the audience.The next scene, a nice contrast because it's back down on the flattest of earth surfaces, shows a pre-teen Jim junior--miraculously, since it's the 23rd century: where'd he get the fossil fuel?--racing a stolen Corvette across the desert a few lengths in front of a motorcycle cop, jumping out just before the 'vette pitches over a cliff and hanging there--a time-worn dramatic device that will be repeated again more than once. This tow-head smart-aleck is an annoying little cuss, but he's certainly got balls far beyond his years. He's ready to ""boldly go."" I have never watched a whole 'Star Trek' original episode, and if I've glimpsed any of the ten-odd movie spin-offs, I've forgotten. I can believe, however, that this is both one of the better ones--and missing certain essential elements in the interpretation of the original characters and in the way ""issues"" are brought up in the series as originally conceived. The only ""issues"" seemed to be to stop a bad guy bent on destroying the galaxy, and the conflict between the cold logic of Zachary Quinto's Spock and the obnoxious spunk (but creative initiative) of Chris Pine's Jim Kirk. The young Kirk, more or less the star, played by Chris Pine, is a bad-boy cutie. His pretty face is always bruised and scarred from a brawl, or maybe it's acne. Pine's Kirk bursts with boyish energy that's hard to resist. What's not so easy is to imagine how such an obstreperous twerp would be allowed on board the space ship, let alone be rapidly moved to a leadership position in the highly regimented, not to say repressive and fascistic, intergalactic system.It's also not quite clear how a nerdy character like the half-Klingon Spock would be so highly regarded, if Kirk's kind of, well, enterprise, were deeply valued. Are they just two sides of one person, maybe? But mostly there's so much action going on in 'Star Trek' that it's not important to ponder such questions. It primarily just gorgeous special effects.There are some appealing secondary characters (not as much multi-galactic social color as in 'Star Wars,' though, by a long sight). Simon Pegg the English actor plays Scotty with a real Scottish brogue and a peppy comical manner. Anton Yelchin who is really a young Russian-born actor but grew up here and speaks perfect English, does a funny but accurate Russian accent as the 17-year-old navigator, Chekhov. John Cho, who plays the Asian crew member Hikaru Sulu, is the quite amusing guy who plays Harold in the 'Harold and Kumar' comedies, but he's not very amusing here. I was surprised to see Winona Rider was in the cast. I thought she might have been the green floozy, but she turns out to have played Spock's human mother. I know nothing about the guy who plays the young Spock. He is not interesting. But Leonard Nimoy himself, the original Spock, is on hand to play the old Spock, who returns from the future to help out. That is a lovely touch, though the writers have to get tangled up in a time warp to stage it.Eric Bana as the evil leader Nero is fine, if you don't mind that all his cohorts look pretty much identical to him--all swarthy, shaven-headed, tattooed leathermen. The contrast with the bright-eyed dazzlingly-lit world of the Enterprise reminds me of the Drapes and Squares of my high school, or the Greasers and Soscs of S.E. Hinton's 'The Outsiders.' How is it that the proper good-boy spaceships are by NASA out of Mies van der Rohe, while Nero's are like rough-hewn medieval sculpted weapons? You kind of have to like the originality of the Nero vessels, but they don't look very aerodynamic.It seems to be the rule now that when a blockbuster is half decent, the flacks rush in with raves when it's barely out of the can. I'd side more with Anthony Lane (""This new 'Star Trek' is nonsense, no question. . .but at least it's not boggy nonsense"" or Roger Ebert (""you want space opera, you got it"").",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a fan of Star Trek.,"I have not even watch any of the Star Trek movies, not the 2003 movie. But it is J.J Abrams that makes me interested in the reboot/remake. His previous movie, Mission Impossible 3, is good and is the best of the trilogy. His latest effort, Star Trek, is not bad either. There is drama, there is fast-paced action and there is amazing special effects. J.J Abrams is famous for producing TV series, Lost, and the shaky Cloverfield.The story: The origin of Star Trek. It reaches out to everyone whether fan or not. Reboots/remakes are usually different from the original, this is something people need to accept while watching them in order to enjoy or like them. There are many successful reboots like Batman, Hulk and now Star Trek. J.J Abrams makes movies that are not too long or not too short. They usually clock around 2 hours, not more or not less. That is why, his movies are entertaining. His movies do not make you feel that they are dragged or being cut short. Now the story goes at a fast pace. Especially for those who are watching Star Trek for the first time. There is enough suspense and when it comes to action, it is purely intensity. The action scenes are breath-taking, fast-paced and are moving in a frenetic way. The music is epic too.Overall: Yeah, I don't know whether it is a good reboot but it is definitely a good adventure movie and worth the watch. Those interested in the origin of the Star Trek should catch. J.J Abrams' fans should catch this too. Star Trek's fans will catch this one. If there is a sequel, it should be up in my must-watch movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"An extraordinary spectacle, visually stunning, otherwise uninspiring for a Star Trek virgin","There seems to be a disparity in reception of this film between hard- core Star Trek fans. Half seems to think it's an incredibly faithful adaptation with fantastic action and lovable characters, the other half seem to think this works as a guidebook on 'Star-Trek-for-dummies', with writing and intellect far below the standard they have seen previously in the Star Trek series. I, however, have never seen Star Trek, nor have I held any interest in it, but I can honestly say that this film impressed me.The setting was intriguing, the vulcans were extremely interesting and the characters were fun and likable. But lord almighty is this film beautiful. Everything from the Enterprise to the giant enemy space look absolutely astonishing, Star Trek boasts battles of epic proportions and (no other way to say it) badass aliens that look really cool. The direction and soundtrack are appropriate for the scale; action is reminiscent of the early Star Wars films, though seriously upgraded, orchestrated with booming percussion and high violin that might as well classify as space pornography.The film however is not without fault; the writing, while good for an action film, may disappoint some fans looking for the intricate complexity of the science fiction, and didn't really draw me in all that much compared with the aesthetic. And while the characters are fun, I didn't really sympathise with any of them too much, though Spok especially seemed to possess an extremely deep and interesting race and back story that kind of got glossed over in the grand scheme of shooty space action. I was a bit disappointed myself; the Vulcans seemed fascinating and I would've liked to learn more about them, but we are only given the bare bones. I think, to me, none of the characters acted in a human way, which put me off somewhat, but that might be the entire point of an grandeur space opera, people go about things in a completely different manner. I just didn't see any real weakness in the characters that made me think them human. Spok briefly shows a crack in composure, but the entire nature of the vulcan people is to be calculating and logical, so he remains blank throughout the rest of the film.The villains in this also perplexed me slightly, we are merely told of their motives and then they just pop up now and then, whenever they feel like it, it seems. Villains become better when we know more about them; it offers a kind of moral conflict in our minds when we sympathise with immoral motives. This isn't true of all villains (Dark Knight's Joker), but then the acting needs to be excellent and 3 dimensional, which it isn't here.Any complaints I have are personal gripes, and even with them I can still highly recommend Star Trek, regardless of your Trek disposition.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just another big budget action film,"JJ Abrams last project is one of the most well known franchises out there,Star Trek.I have never seen the original show nor the movies. I only saw a couple of episodes from a 90's spin-off and I was very young. But I am well aware of how famous this franchise is and the huge following it has so I was curious to watch this. The film chronicles the early days of James T. Kirk and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew members... To be honest this is just another big budget action film.It creates an illusion of excitement by having people running around all the time and shooting weapons, gigantic ships firing lasers,black holes destroying planets and what not,but the truth is the story is weak,not that interesting and its been done before. The most interesting part in the movie is the time travel which serves as a plot device,that's something that is always pretty cool and obviously it raises certain questions about different realities and changing the past or the future and that is something that fascinates me. But, I did my research, and apparently time travel has been used several times in the previous movies of this franchise; and even worst then that is the fact that this exactly same plot device is being used RIGHT NOW in the TV show Lost(which I love), a project JJ Abrams is part of; talk about lack of creativity...there are also a few plot holes and clichés that contribute to the overall poor quality of this flick. Onto the acting, Zachary Quinto wasn't bad as Spock but I don't think this kind of role suits him very well,he's much more comfortable and more importantly,believable, for instance,as the crazy and psychotic Sylar in Heroes.Chris Pine was a pleasant surprise,good performance and, he carried the movie on his back.And then we have Leonard Nimoy with a not so small cameo,who's been doing this character over 40 years.I'm sure the fans were delighted to see him back. From the little I know I don't think the film honored the original show and it hasn't converted me as a fan either...6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad,"Not a bad Star Trek movie. Not a bad film. Perhaps the best of the ""odd numbered"" Treks. Far better than the last ""even numbered."" The acting was good. The characterization superb. The special effects were well executed and not distracting or over the top. It was certainly entertaining. The plot was a little unnecessarily convoluted. Apparently reading some prequel comic makes it clearer. But, for me, the film's major downfall was an overabundance of smarmy meta-textual in-jokes that hampered the pacing of the film combined with some glaring logic errors. Some of them are quite clever, but they're a little to frequent and seem a little to ""oh look how clever I am!"" They don't ruin the film, just hold it back a little.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek became Star Wrek,"Okay, I know there are lots of holes in this review, much like the movie. For example, I'm not even a true adult and it's been 6 years since the release of Star Trek. But a review can't kill anyone, right? And please note that there are spoilers in this review, so watch the movie first and then read this if you haven't seen the movie in advance.The movie itself was, to be honest, entertaining. Yet, plot holes are scattered all across the script, and I bet it would take a critic to go through a few short lines and immediately trip on one of them. Let me list them all, or at least most of them:Star Wars's main theme is explosions, shooting, running, explosions, explosions, shooting and death, and I'm sure I mentioned explosions. Star Trek's theme is discovering the universe and its life forms. Now, Sir J.J Abrams turned it into Star Wrek. You try scrolling through the first 10 minutes of the movie. Explosions. Explosions. Death. Shooting protons and phasers. Running crew striving to survive. Explosions. Man down. Death of two captains. All I'm saying is that Star Trek became more militaristic and violent than it originally were in TOS.Now, let's scroll through the rest of the movie. Unlike the original James T Kirk, this one is a brat, immature and flirty. Yay, what would his mirror version be like? I have a feeling the alternate reality became the mirror universe whilst the mirror universe became the prime reality. What the bloody hell?! (It's made-up)Okay, so let's talk about the prime antagonist. Nero, a man who is coincidentally named after a Roman Emperor, with 0 logic. For instance, he hates Spock, a man who tried to help his home planet but failed. And did Spock cause the supernova? NOPE. And did Spock denied to help? NOPE. He flew the ship there, with knowledge that a chance for survival is critical if the supernova incinerates his vessel. The man put his life on the edge, to save Romulus. And all the blame points to him? Where's the logic? Oh right, he's just a miner, how could he possibly know that?And, how is the Narada, a such OP starship, a mining vessel? It took out 47 Klingon warbirds and 7 starships, without minor or none damage visible on the hull. Then, if every single miner in 2387 possessed this ship, then Romulus took over the universe in days.One of the prime faults of this: the goddamit scale. Example: In TOS and the old movies, it takes hours to travel from one planet to the other at warp speed. Now, you can travel from Earth to Vulcan within 3 minutes, at warp factor 3-4, barely 1/3 of the speed of the starships in the original movies. Space tightened...So now, Vulcan is like four solar systems away. Yay!That is hellalot of plot holes, and honestly, I cannot list them all. But on the other hand, it is undeniable that the music was incredible, and the new effects and design of the Enterprise is absolutely beautiful, with even more realistic effects. The main problem with the effects is that there are too many ""lens flares"".Rating: 5/10 star",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am a long time lover of Star Trek,"I have loved Star Trek for 43 years and I loved the new ""Star Trek"" by J.J. Abrams. In fact, I love it more than any version of Star Trek I've ever seen and that's all of it. I love it because I love the Star Trek characters. I love Kirk, Uhura, Dr. McCoy, Spock, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and all. I also love the work of J.J. Abrams and when I learned he was directing a renewed version of the original series, I just had to see it. Though Abrams was never a fan of the series, he directed it as if he were a fan. It is completely faithful to the original series and whenever a new character appeared on screen, I knew immediately who they were. The plot was kind of annoying in some ways but seeing the way everything looked and marveling at what a superb job Abrams did with the casting and all other aspects of the production just thrilled me. No wimpy captains here. Kirk is powerful and dynamic, though he has his faults.I have long dreamed of directing some version of Star Trek myself. I had also thought that the original series should be revived with a new cast. J.J. Abrams not only thought of it, he did it! And superbly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Satisfied but still hungry for more,"I admit I got sucked in by the great reviews and that my expectations were probably too high. I had a good time but I wasn't blown away by it. Why? Weirdly, it might be some of the plot elements (mostly scientific) that hindered my enjoyment. They seemed illogical as Mr. Spock would say. I know Star Trek is supposed to be space opera but the thinking man's humanistic space opera and those seemingly illogical elements created plot holes and coincidences that bugged me. I was even thinking of including most of them in this review with an attempt at explanations but it would make this too long and way too geeky ;-) (read the lower-rated reviews on IMDb if you're curious). Don't get me wrong, the script is fun with enjoyable character moments, a few good surprises, its fair share of adventure and space scenes but enjoy the ride and try not to think too hard.I loved the introduction in space. I thought it was great, dramatic and surprising. The young years of Kirk would have benefited from a little more time but one shouldn't be too greedy and it would have taken time from somewhere else. The casting of the movie was very strong with the highlights for me being the new Spock (the guy actually made me forget his other famous role as Sylar in Heroes) and Dr. McCoy (cynical and even looking very similar). It's amazing how Star Trek references have seeped into modern culture and I think almost anyone, even non-Trekkers, will enjoy the references and homages, especially how the younger actors play their iconic counterparts without turning them into bad caricatures (some might disagree about Chekhov and Scotty but I personally loved them). Almost every crew member besides Kirk and Spock has its moment in the spotlight and yet you wish you would see more of them which is a compliment in itself. The villain would have benefited from being better; he was definitely the weak link. He was underwhelming and stupid. I'm not sure if the culprit was the writing or the interpretation by Eric Bana, probably a mix of both. I also disliked the little alien partner of Scotty and I have no idea why he was included except perhaps to add a cutesy factor and sell action figures.Most of the introductions, meetings and interactions between the adult crew members were joyous and sometimes surprising. The story does keep you guessing as to what will happen next after a particular major event. The pace was good, it was filmed dynamically but the fight scenes were victims of zoomed in shaky cameras preventing us from really seeing them well. Not as bad as other recent American films though. The visual effects were very good except for a few blinding lens flares. There were a couple of moments where I got the shivers (good ones) but then that's because I've been a fan of Star Trek for so long. One was when I saw the Enterprise for the first time (very well modernized yet faithful to the old exterior look, not really so in the inside) and the other time in the middle I cannot reveal except to say that this line made me realize that anything could happen. One could argue that the writers could have been bolder making for a stronger dramatic story but at the risk of alienating the hardcore faithful who might be offended by the reboot anyway. Those trekkers might say the new Star Trek movie invalidates every other Star Trek story out there. I prefer to think that those stories might still be mostly valid (especially those from Next Generation and after) or at least valid in a parallel dimension/universe/timeline whatever. The new Star Trek does free the writers to boldly go where no one has gone before. It was a valiant fun effort well worth watching but I do hope the next instalment is more clever and logical while retaining (or improving) emotional resonance.Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Oh What A Rush,I never really grew up on Star Trek thats why I am thrilled to here that this is a elseworlds story meaning its a ulternate reality. Giving the characters new and updated backstories. A movie that fallows the young escapades of James Tyberious Kirk. A troubled young scamp that cant stay out of trouble. From stealing hi...s step dads car to getting into bar fights and sleeping with green women. A young man whos life is without purpose until he is recruited into starfleet. Where he develops a rivalry with one Mr. Spock. Mr. Spock a young man who is brought up to repress his emotions. He is also a boy of mixed origens both species and race. He is half Valcon half Human. Making him a target and 100% black sheep a walking taboo if you will. This movie is a summer blockbuster like no other it is a rollercoster ride of thrills. It is rare that scripted humour works in a action movie. In this film it does.The fight coriography is awesome. The movie is surreal the setting and atmosphere ingulps you bringing you into the world of Star Trek. Notice the camera work while they walk around the ship.

Not What our fathers grew up with,"Earlier tonight I was given the pleasure of watching the latest Star Trek film and I have got to admit that it surpassed even my expectations. I was expecting a sexed up version of the original series that my dad grew up with and that I grew up with the re runs of. I was only half right. What waited for me was not only a sexed up version of what I'd grown to love over the years but a new beginning for the franchise.The movie begins with an epic battle sequence showing the voyage of the USS Kelvin versus a monstrous Romulan vessel know as the Narada. During the battle George Kirk gives his life as the captain of the Kelvin so that the rest of the crew, including his wife and newborn son, can escape. The next part of the movie shows the son (James T Kirk) 25 years later going to star fleet academy. When a problem arises on planet Vulcan, all of the Star Fleet cadets are called to help out. When they arrive at Vulcan they find that the same ship that had destroyed the Kelvin 28 years earlier is attacking Vulcan.This movie is absolutely fantastic, and one of the reasons for this is the casting. I know that most trekkies were rather uneasy about rebooting the series because of the casting issue but they did a fantastic job. McCoy and Spock were perfectly cast and did great jobs of taking on the characters and making them their own. Kirk was taken on by Chris Pine and this may be considered blasphemy by Trek fans but I like him as much as I liked Shatner. My favourite member had to be Scotty. He was the one person (Simon Pegg) that I knew would do a bang up job.That is not to say the the casting was the only good thing, because the direction, special effects, and editing were all just as great.

And for years I was at a loss why and how the Star Trek universe declined into the sad state it was before this movie. The magic was gone. No new movie or new series that tried the capture the essence of the universe worked. And many TVproducers/filmmakers tried again and again...but with no results.Now a brave director makes an attempt of reviving the universe,by killing what came before. In the meantime giving you vistas that nobody could imagine and making you wonder what will happen next...But the only thing that the some fans do, is complain about the fact that it isn't the same. Well guess what...""the same"" was tried again and again...and it didn't work. So cut the crap and appreciate the new possibilities(Even the next generation was an extreme reboot of the original series).

I can't help but wish that the re-launch was accompanied by a better story.,"I have a feeling that I'm missing a bit of the intended Star Trek experience, by not watching it on the big screen. It's easy to see how the action sequences and special effects would make a much bigger impression at the theater, and without those to blow the viewer away, the movie has to depend on its less flashy elements. This isn't to the film's advantage.At times it ""feels"" like Star Trek, and at times it absolutely doesn't. This is coming from a mild Trek fan, at best. The story didn't do much for me. It's like the writers latched onto the very first semi-decent idea that they had, when it wouldn't have hurt to brainstorm a bit more. Nero seems a lot more like a villain from a forgettable TV episode, than the grand return of the series to the big screen. Most of the cast made little impression on me at all.They certainly won't be replacing the original actors in my mind.

A Twinge of Nostalgia,"Star Trek is an enjoyable space adventure for everyone. Whether you loved the original series/movies or never got into them, there is something for you in this film. The cast is excellent, the editing is superb (especially the sound) and the story is a solid introduction to the Star Trek universe.From the first scene, it is evident that this would be an emotional story. The character depth is sincere and it was fulfilling to see each member of the team take their rightful place on the Enterprise. While the original series is all about intellect, negotiations and ""Kobayashi Maru"" type scenarios, this film focused a little too heavily on the action. There were moments that felt more like a Power Rangers film than Star Trek.Overall, the film is one of the best reboots in recent history. Filled with daring action, a twinge of nostalgia (nothing like a few red shirts) and great characters, Star Trek is a strong starting point for the future of the USS Enterprise.Best Character: Kirk

"Great movie, worth watchin on the BIG screen","Just wanted to tell you, I went to see the new Star Trek movie yesterday evening. I don't know if you're familiar with Star Trek story or not. Personally I wasn't. I think I must have seen or two of the latest movie they've made, but I've never seen any of the series.So if you're like me. Don't worry, you don't really need to know the story to understand the movie. Mostly because it happens before the series, and tells the youth of the main characters and how they got to know each other and end up on the Enterprise (kinda like what they did with Batman Begins).Now onto the movie itself. It was GREAT. Really, really great. I had seen the trailer and knew it looked promising, but I wasn't expecting it to be so great.Special effects: Really awesome. I hadn't been to the Kino in a long time and movie I saw which had lots of effects was probably Matrix 3, and woah they really learned how to do better effects since. And seeing it on the big screen really makes it more intense than at home.Action: LOTS of action. Spaceships going boom, hand-to-hand fight. It's intense and not boring at all.Story: It was interesting. Like I said I'm not too familiar with the TV Series so I don't know the mythology well. But I think they've kinda respected it. And they also pulled a rabbit out of their hat that allows them to go slightly a different way from the series. I'm not going to say to much, cause it would be spoilers, but it all makes sense in the end. Other bonus: there was a lot of humour here and there, which makes the movie very enjoyable and really balances well the action sequences.Characters: I think pretty much everyone was well casted and they all had a pretty good chemistry. Again I had not seen the original characters too much. But from what I know, yeah the new ones are great. Special mention to Zachary Quinto (the guy who plays Sylar in Heroes) who makes a really really really great Spock. Other bonus point: you get to see Leonard Nimoy (the guy who played Spock in the original series) quite a lot. I thought he was maybe just going to make a small cameo or something, but no, he really is important to the story.Music: The soundtrack was done by the same guy who made the music on Alias and Lost so I kinda recognised his style every now and then. It was also well made. Bonus point: there were time where there was no music, pretty much just silence. I think this must have happened twice, just before a heavy action sequence. I've always found this to be a great way to intensified the moment.So yeah overall a very good movie. And if you're into sci-fi things like I am, I really recommend you to go see it. It's really worth watching it on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's a noisy cartoon, Jim.","That I've got all 80 episodes of the original marvellous TV series on a titchy flash stick would have had Mr. Spock's eyes go round with wonder. I used to love those moral and intelligent stories with beginnings, middles and ends but by now Star Trek has now gone where no older man should really follow. This is cinema purely for kids of all ages or people coming across Star Trek for the first time with admirably open minds.Young and brash James Tiberius Kirk comes of age as the Captain of the USS Enterprise spaceship, picking up his to be famous crew one by one to reboot the franchise, sorry, legend. On the way they have many loud and chaotic adventures, the main problem coming from a Romulan renegade from the future intent on making Spock watch his home planet Vulcan be destroyed. Belief must be suspended for the duration of the film but especially when young Kirk meets old Spock in the ice cave; it was so sloppy it had me too transfixed to laugh. At least Spock had his false teeth in.The cgi cartoonery is slick, relentless, fantastic, brutal, confusing – in fact everything that is required nowadays, acting and physical sets are adequate, but of course the story comes a solid last as usual. Why couldn't the rogue Romulan and his crew on their trillion trillion dollar spaceship go back in time to save their planet from destruction instead of looking for a dubious vengeance for its said destruction? It's the ridiculous graphics that take the attention – as soulless, heartless and pointless as all the other bloated cartoons made nowadays – King Kong, Prometheus, Hobbit etc. There's nothing here that has added to the original series or inspired in me anything other than to watch the original series again – that at least was Star Trek after all. It looks good, isn't dull and passed the time for me, somehow. Ah well, now for Into Darkness!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Trek back to the future opens a whole new universe.,"This new star trek film is an amazing achievement. On its own merits, it is a well made science fiction movie with great acting made easy by a good story and very well done special effects. It blends the real world of today with the possibilities of the future with seamless effectiveness. It is almost like reading a good Asimov sci-fi novel, but only come to life on the big screen. From the opening scene, it is clear that human emotion and interaction are central to the story, something missing from many of the sci-fi pictures being made. As to the fact that it is a star trek movie, the entire new cast is, in my opinion, just as good and true to the original crew. I have to say that Zachary Quinto, as Spock, was my favorite, it was truly a really good performance. But Karl Urban, as Bones, was the greatest surprise; I did not believe anyone could ever pull off playing Dr. McCoy, but he did with all the emotion, insight and fun. Most of the credit has to go to J.J. Abrams, he has put together a very smart, fast passedand cohesive film, the fact that he has also rejuvenated the best loved sci-fi entity in the universe is further testament to his achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressive job on this Star Trek movie,"For the most part, this was a GREAT movie. I am a fan of the Original Star Trek, but not a fanatic. I do hope they will make a TV series from this movie. It is exciting to think of the possibilities, as the actors develop the characters from the original team. I wonder about the change in Spock's character, as that was an intrinsic part of the original series – it really takes something away by not having it. On the other hand, in my opinion, in the original series, the doctor overdid it somewhat on his emotional responses to Spock – this ""new"" doctor may be able to improve on that. I am disappointed in the relationship that Uhura and Spock have going – it is quite out of character for both people and for the series in general. One aspect of the original, that made is so good, was that the main characters didn't have a permanent on-going ""intimate"" relationship with someone, and never had that kind of relationship between themselves. It was the way that the characters related to each other and worked together that made the show such a success. Other points that factored into the success of the original Star Trek is the absence of sexual scenes and the near absence of profanity. I hope that high standard will continue to be upheld. Except for the one minor sex scene, in this new movie they did very well regarding those two aspects. I am impressed and pleased. Three cheers for the ones responsible for that. Please, please don't get sucked into using profanity, sex, and blood and gore, like most of the movies out there today. Thank you for doing such a good job on this comeback. Good luck with developing it into another fun, exciting series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice Production,"Star Trek (2009)** 1/2 (out of 4)Okay, I must start off by saying I'm not a fan of the series and I'm not a hater. I've seen one of the original films and I don't recall a thing about it. I've watched bits and pieces of the original TV series over the years but not a single episode complete. So, I'm writing this as an outsider so I have no feelings going into the film in regards to anything that does or doesn't happen and how things might be different than what came before this. What story is here centers on Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) as the two must put aside their differences to try and stop an evil leader (Eric Bana) who plans on destroying just about everything he can. I guess it should be said that this is a rather amazing production that has one great action scene after another. The visual look of the film is quite amazing and it always amuses me to watch something like this and know that there are people out there with this type of imagination that can really open up and let stuff like this fly out. The CGI-effects are mighty impressive and even the cast members, for the most part, offer up nice performances. I'd also add that Abrams handles all the material extremely well and delivers not only a brilliant look but the action scenes all try to top the previous one. With that said, there's a lot to look at but there's very little heart or soul to be had. Perhaps fans of the series or previous movies will disagree but to me this was just one big action picture full of eye candy but nothing else in terms of a story. The CGI effects, while great, take up 98% of everything we see so they are the movie and not the characters, their actions or anything else. I'm certainly not expecting Bergman here but I did expect a little more. This is certainly a summer blockbuster at its highest levels in terms of action, explosions and all around spectacle, which will be reason enough for millions to view it and enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Thrilling Adventure and Rebirth of Star Trek,"Prepare for the ultimate interstellar galactic adventure in the new Star Trek. The movie is perfect. With a plot that has you sitting on the edge of your seat, stunning visuals and great acting from an all star cast, this all new look and rebirth of the Star Trek franchise will be a pleasing to everyone. Unlike previous Star Trek movies which are aimed more towards audiences, this movie is for everyone and here is why.The story primarily focuses on how Kirk and Spock become the characters we know them to be. It starts with a back story on each of their childhoods revealing their strengths and weaknesses. The chemistry between them is no doubt one of the greatest aspects of the movie thanks to young actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. As the movie goes on they find themselves fighting with each other until they eventually realize their differences and come together to fight the common enemy Nero, a slightly troubled Romulan played by Eric Bana who is capable of destroying an entire planet! The new young crew of the enterprise finds themselves dealing with problems and confrontations they've never experienced before and do their best to take on the evil Romulan.I have to say this is one of the best casted movies I've seen in a while. Each member does their part to give the new crew of the Enterprise some originality as well as maintaining enough similarities to the characters of the old Trek. Actors Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), John Cho (Harold and Kumar) and Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) help to add comic relief throughout the film all the while you're sitting on the edge of your seat shivering with anxiety. I was really surprised by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's performance as Kirk and Spock. They both have never experienced a leading role for a highly anticipated summer film and did great. They fit into their roles so perfectly and had such great chemistry together. Eric Bana was fantastic as the villain; you can hardly tell it's him with all that alien make up. You will even be surprised by the appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Spock from the future, satisfying die hard Trek fans. Did I mention the visual effects yet? If I have already I must re-emphasize how spectacular they are. The scenes in outer space are all beautifully done with many bright explosions and colorful laser blasts. There are a few monsters in the movie that are simply terrifying and look completely believable as monsters of a distant future. Even the sounds are amusing to listen to as alarms on the spacecraft and explosions rattle the audience.It's truly one of the best movies I've seen in a while and a great reboot to the Trek Franchise. It's no surprise that this piece of magic was produced by J.J Abrams (creator of Lost). He truly knows how to make an engaging piece of work. It's a perfect combo of action, adventure, science fiction and drama. This is one of those movies that will have you wishing it would go on and on and when it comes to an endyou just want to see it again.Live long and prosper",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kind of felt all over the place...,"In preparation for tonight's Star Trek Beyond release, I decided to re-watch the first two movies and review them, because why not?I think it's probably important to note that I haven't see the TV show. I've seen parts here and there but I think my opinion of the movies might be different than a huge fan of the show. I just started to watch the movies and I love it so much, I think I might start the show soon.What I LikedIt's weird seeing actors you know playing other roles... I get it, that's their job. But imagining Thor and Emma Swan (Once Upon a Time) as the parent's of Kirk is really funny... side note over.This Star Trek movie is kind of an origin story, at least in the beginning. We get to see Kirk's parents, Kirk as a mischievous kid and Spock on Vulcan. It's fun to see the characters we come to love as little kids :D so cute, so adorable. I want to hug them and their high pitched little voices. Is that weird? I hope not XD but little Spock was so cute, he has so much sass. I love Spock... I am a Spock fan...Another thing that made the whole origin story aspect great was how the two separate character plots came together. We see Spock at his school excelling at his education and then we see him leave it all for Starfleet. We see Kirk get into a fight and accept a dare to join Starfleet. I really liked how their two separate stories came into one.The actors were perfect for their characters! I looooooove these characters. I love their bickering and fighting, I love their quick disagreements. They were amusing and funny, especially Spock vs Kirk which went on pretty much since they met. They go back and forth so much, it's hilarious.The visual effects in this were amazing! I liked all the lens flair looking things, the battle lasers (laaaassserrrrs), the alien's looked interesting, just everything. This movie really did a great job transporting you into a world filled with aliens and futuristic technology.What I Didn't LikeAs much as I liked a lot about this movie, it wasn't as good as the second one to me. This Star Trek movie starts off by throwing you into the action. From the first second the movie starts, there is fighting and explosions and confusion if you have no idea what is going on.The origin part that I loved so much, ended up making the movie seem choppy because it was always jumping back and forth between Spock and Kirk as kids, as teens, slowly growing up. I just didn't like all the back and forth between characters, it wasn't smooth.Star Trek is science fiction, I get that, but the action in this movie was non-stop. There was too much fighting, too many explosions that it ended up feeling... overused? I like it when there is some action because it means more, if that makes sense.My biggest problem with this movie was the villain. He was... lame. Unlike the second movie, this villain didn't feel threatening, and was taken out way to easily. He did some pretty bad things I will admit that, but I mean... he wasn't Khan. Khan was a monster, this guy? He was... a caterpillar.OverallAll in all, Star Trek was all over the place. It was a pretty good origin~ish story for Kirk and Spock and how his team was formed, but it was choppy. The villain wasn't that bad and there was way too much action for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice!,"All one would expect to see in a Star Trek picture! Nice watch. Not terrific, but solid.The good: I LOVE it when the jokes are good. And these dialogues and one liners are really playful and witty.More good: the characters are solid as well. That's often a rarity in these kind of blockbusters, but director/producer J. J. Abrams KNOWS how to make great characters come to life in a BIG movie like this.All the technical details are really nice. The photography looks like eye candy, the soundscore is glorious and big like it should be.Any bad? Well, it aint exactly thrilling or really suspenseful, but who cares, it's quite enjoyable.The only little gripe I had was that the actor who portrayed the bad guy wasnt very impressive.

"A little old, A LOT new...","Saw the new ""Star Trek"" movie at the super secret World Premiere a few weeks back in Austin, Texas. Wrote an opinion for it immediately afterward for IMDb, but somehow my opinion never got published.I will say that I am one of few dissenters on the crazy ""this is the best Trek ever"" bandwagon. That distinction belongs to ""Wrath of Khan"", for reasons that are myriad and don't really belong here. The new film is good, not great, but does accomplish a major task, which is to make the franchise fresh for new audiences.Remember that Roddenberry's ""Trek"" was all about ideas: can mankind reach an enlightened state of existence, and tackle the universe's great mysteries (read: social allegory of the time) with intelligence and wisdom, instead of might and fight? For the most part, ""Trek"" has managed to embody more of the former, while giving us enough space battles and arch-nemesis' to keep the sci-fi action fans happy.How does Abrams new movie marry these basic tenets of ""Star Trek""? It doesn't, opting for lightning-fast-action right out of the gate, and not stopping for a second to ponder anything of depth for its running time. Now, I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing - what it gives us a pretty cool sci-fi action movie, just not a true ""Trek"" movie.Abrams may or may not have been the man to ultimately give this series new relevance. Only time (and sequels) will tell. Let's look at his casting choices, and how they fare. Pine as Kirk is passable - he neither defames the legacy nor elevates it. Much more interesting is Quinto as Spock. The script plays up Spock's inner battle between logic and emotion, and Quinto finds the right tone for this re-imaging (it doesn't hurt that the REAL Spock, Leonard Nimoy, shows up for inspiration. How the filmmakers manage that trick may upset your Trek sensibilities, depending, really, on how well you like the movie). Saldana's Uhura is soulful and intriguing, and Urban has got the right idea as Bones (but tell me you don't think of Hugh Jackman every time you see him). Let's hope we see more of him in the sequels. Sulu and Checkov, just like in the TV show, get little screen time or depth, and Pegg is funny as Scotty, but you're always aware that its Pegg, and not the character, making you laugh.But finally, regardless of what you think of the casting choices, or the playing loose with the Trek universe rules, or the little things that don't seem quite right, the move suffers because of its lack of a strong villain - Bana's miffed Romulan is a snooze. Given hardly any screen time or back story, he's simply there to create a reason for the movie to be, instead of emerging seamless from the world of Trek itself.And that may be what makes or breaks this for you. Sure, it's pretty rousing entertainment, but it's really not Roddenberry's universe anymore. And as such, things can come and go as they please to fit the needs of Abrams' vision. Whether or not it's a vision that can stand the test of time, like, oh, say ""Star Trek"", is a future-tense discussion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I made my decision...,"Which would you rather see, another crappy film that tries to stick to all the old Star Trek facts or an excellent new film that breathes new life into the what was becoming a worn-out series..With the exception of Wrath of Khan, I found all the Star Trek movies mainly dull, tedious and forgettable. And this coming from a longtime fan of the 60's series...The new Star Trek movie was exciting, stimulating and just plain fun. I really believed these were the younger versions of the Star Trek crew that I enjoyed as a kid.. It did not try to lecture us, or remind us of anything, it just tried to be entertaining. And to me it absolutely did so. I'm sure a second film will be in the works if this one is a success. And I think it will be.

'Decent' film IF you are not a fan of the real Star Trek franchise.,"I had very high hopes for this film, but instead of giving us what they said they were going to, the origins of Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise, Abrams and the writers decided to just throw 40 years of Star Trek cannon in the trash, and make up their own story.I will agree that Star Trek needed to be 'updated' to bring in new fans... but what the writers did was cheated. Yes it would have been hard to write a 'prequel' to a story that has 40 years of history... but to just throw all that history and cannon away in the opening scenes of movie was just lazy and pathetic.This was NOT a Star Trek movie, regardless of what the characters names may have been.Then on top of that, there were many things about the film that I found very out of place or out right annoying. So many of the sets on the Enterprise looked like real life factories or breweries... turns out they are.But most of all, I hated all the 'lens flare'. It's in almost every scene in the movie. Most directors do everything they can to AVOID lens flare and use it only as rare artistic touch.... it turns out that Abrams LOVES lens flares and actually had people shinning bright lights up into the cameras to create them when they wouldn't have been there naturally. I've come to see his love for lens flares in other films like 'Super 8'.Setting my dislike of Abrams style, and the fact that he chose to simply ignore 40 years of Star Trek history, it's not a bad sic-fi/action film.... but it is NOT a Star Trek film and I doubt very much if I will bother seeing the sequel that is currently in the works.

All the old actors (that are still alive) should be proud to have these young actors portray the characters they took so long to develop. I think this movie will spawn a whole new generation of Trekkers! I know my son is 25 years old and I'm sure he doesn't consider himself a Trekker. He might after seeing this show.

A Big Splashy Hollywood Summer Movie with Good Acting and Great Writing?!?,"When I step into the summer multiplex, I know that in order to have a good time, there are certain things I'm going to have to ignore like the terrible writing and embarrassing acting. I need to remind myself ""I'm here for the blasting air conditioning and to see some stuff explode.""So imagine my surprise when I saw the excellently acted and smartly written reboot of Star Trek. JJ Abrams was wise to chose mostly unknowns and B listers for the core roles. Chris Pine, as James Kirk breathes a rebellious and tender core into the character. This is a rough and tumble Kirk with damage and a bad attitude. Pine creates a Kirk worth cheering for. Heroes' Zachary Quinto is pitch perfect as Spock both psychically and emotionally. As expected Simon Pegg infuses Scotty with humor and hipness needed for this type of franchise. A huge surprise here is Zoe Saldana as Uhura. Saldana is an actress I'm familiar with from campy movies like Crossroads (with Britney Spears!), Center Stage, and Drumline. But her resume is completely forgiven when she steps on screen as Uhura. Sexy, strong, and brilliant this is not the quiet Uhura of the past. There's a sadness and vulnerability that she displays as well but I'm not telling you how or why that happens.In fact, the script is so well written each scene filled with surprises that I'll leave the spoilers to someone else. Instead, I'll simply talk about the quality of the writing. Orci and Kurtzman smartly pepper each scene with little and vital Trek details without trying to hard. And the structure of the plot is GENIUS. The pair wisely avoided cramming too many details in and stuck with a strong story. What a concept! Around each corner of the film, is something to thrill, delight, and even touch the viewers.Abrhams should also be applauded for his smart and stunning direction. Actual sets and not tons of CGI give this Trek an authentic, tangible feel much like the original series. He also avoids the self- congratulatory shots and masturbatory action sequences like other big budget films (cough, Dark Knight, cough, Watchmen, cough). Instead he develops the characters and focuses on the story. In short, it's amazing and classic like the first Superman and original Star Wars trilogy.So the first big blockbuster of summer 2009 is one you don't have to be embarrassed to say you loved. You are allowed to keep your brain on while you watch it. You don't have to be a fan of the original to enjoy it. You just have to like great movies. And Star Trek is precisely that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a whole lot of fun,"The 2009 version of ""Star Trek"" is a ""re-imagined"" prequel to the famed Gene Roddenberry TV series from the 1960s. In this outing, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a hell-raising 23rd Century Iowa farm boy who's tired of living in the shadow of his father, a Starfleet captain who died a hero's death, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his crew (the infant James and his mother included). Yet, after just a single pep talk from one Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), the hotshot Kirk figures it's time to hang up his motorcycle - or the futuristic equivalent thereof - and follow in his hallowed father's footsteps by becoming a member of Starfleet himself.Meanwhile, on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock suffers persecution for being half-human on his mother's side and, thus, opts to sign on to become a commander with the Earth-based Federation rather than serve in the Vulcan Science Academy, as any decent, civic-minded Vulcan with his kind of aptitude is expected to do.Soon, Kirk and the famously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto) are serving together on the maiden voyage of the spanking new Starship Enterprise, along with such familiar faces as Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) in their younger years, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) getting a chance to hop aboard later on. Before they know it, the Enterprise is locked in battle with the Romulans, led by a villain named Nero (Eric Bana), who are trying to make a black hole out of Vulcan, with Earth as their next target.If none of this sounds particularly familiar even to die-hard Trek fans, it's probably because scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have concocted a time-shifting/alternate-reality version of events that goes against much of what we've previously been told regarding the back story of these characters. One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows Leonard Nimoy to join in on the proceedings, playing Spock as an older incarnation of himself.The script has some fun parodying Kirk's reputation for one-upmanship and serial womanizing, but a little of that does go a long way. Still, the tension that develops between the cocksure Kirk and the similarly adamant Spock (both well played by Pine and Quinto) is nicely balanced against the camaraderie of two equally skilled professionals working at the peak of their abilities in a common cause.Special kudos go to director J.J. Abrams for the tremendously exciting action sequences he has created for this film, including one amazing scene atop a giant drill platform located miles above the planet's surface. No surprise, the art direction, production design and special effects are all first-class, and editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon have assembled all the pieces together for maximum impact.This latest incarnation is good fun for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well casted good flick,"I'm an old school trek fan. Reruns in the early 70s every day after school. I've seen'em all 100 times each. I loved the characters. JJ did a great job picking new people to fill these shoes (literally). Spock and Bones are played well like you would guess they were. Kirk's goofy mannerisms from the 60s are gone, but his recklessness remains (his strength). The plot's a little thin and contrived but effective in pulling together these characters. We all know no one dies of consequence (except the red shirt guys :)) since we know their future (or do we?). The plot has the smart move of allowing for the past to change. If this wasn't there then the outcome would be all too well known. The only things they could have left out were the silly Bones/Spock banter. That type of stuff could have waited for the next movie. Another thing would be the theft of the plot from Wrath of Khan. Twisted yes, but borrowed from on a lot of levels.9/10. Kirk's rise from cadet to captain was lame and should have taken longer. The villain was not the best. I doubt I could have come up with something better. It was worth the $5 I paid.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a Movie!!,I have never been a fan of the series and have never seen any of the other movies but this totally blew me away.The visual effects from JJ Abrams Bad Robot Productions was phenomenal. The plot wasn't a complex and engaging one but it was great to go with the film overall just plain and simple.Every single character was played fantastically by the new cast and my word they are good. Still a little uncertain about Simon Pegg but he did add some good humour to the film.This is a must-see film definitely at the cinema or if you lucky to be near one at IMAX where you will see this film in all it's glory.Hope this was useful to you and as you can see it's not biased.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I have to say JJ Abrams has done a great job reviving a story that i always thought was boring. the acting was spot on especially Spock And Bones.James t Kirk did an exceptional job as well the thing that really sets this movie apart were the fantastic Special Effects i mean they were mind blowing Blasting space ships ,exploding planets,weird alien monsters this movie has it all.So if you've never seen anything related to Star Trek yet this might as well be a start for you And for all you seasoned trekies this might as well be the start of a brand new journey. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very entertaining... and this is coming from a non-Trekkie!,"Apart from the classic 60's TV show, which i enjoyed as a little kid, ""Star Trek"" never appealed to me. I'm not really a science-fiction-fan to begin with, and I find most of Gene Roddenberry's universe (or what was added to it later on) rather lofty and plain nerdy.However, I've heard good things about this re-boot of the franchise, so I gave it a shot. I didn't regret it. J.J. Abrams (or whoever is really responsible for the outcome of this) did a fine job of looking for the things that are actually fun about ""Star Trek"": space battles, adventures on unknown planets with horrific monster and also a nice dose of comedy.The casting choices are nothing short of inspired. Chris Pine captures that lumbering charm of William Shatner perfectly. Zachary Quinto moves his eye brow exactly like Leonard Nimoy did and turns Spock into something of a hunk. Uhura is sexier than ever, Bones is grumpy as always and Scotty... well, I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, but I wasn't really sure why all of a sudden Scotty was a stand-up comedian. The important thing is that the characters and all their connections to one another were set up properly while never letting the fun factor slip away. We get to see why Bones is always holding a grudge against Spock, how Kirk managed to become Captain even though he is something of a slacker and so on and so forth.A few things might turn true Trekkies off. There is very much slapstick. It never becomes a parody of ""Star Trek"", but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which as a non-fan I enjoyed a lot. However, if you spend every second weekend at a ""Star Trek""-convention in your favorite Clingone-costume, you may hate that approach.Also, the writers added a couple of things like Uhura becoming Kirk's and Spock's (wtf??) love interest or the whole ""alternate timeline""-storyline (I'm still not sure if that made a whole lotta sense, but whatever).The point is, that this movie is not over-thinking every detail, but it concentrates on characters, funny one-liners, comedic timing and action - and that makes it the very first thoroughly enjoyable ""Star Trek""-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The significance,"Well recently I was involved in very hot dispute about the point of view and the meaning of two greatest ever sci-fi movies Star Trek and Star Wars. So some people often believes that Star Wars movies are charming very dramatic filled with amazing action scenes, love and all those gadgets and so on. With few words, what we have? There is big intergalactic space ships with big hallways and chambers operated by computers with big buttons like on my a year old nephew baby toys!?! Light sabers working in full absence of any course of nature. The list is gonna be too long, OK the story is good - A long time ago...wtf... that's why I would stop here. Star Trek - is our future!!! Every single part of that movie describes what we have before us. Every scientific element in Star Trek saga has a physic explanation and theoretically can be done. If still there is people wondering where's the difference well as long as Star Wars telling us story about our past Star Trek is leading us to our future.

This is how you reboot,"Star Trek successfully modernizes the franchise with a genuinely thrilling blockbuster that quickly charts its own course to free itself of the burden of continuity whilst still being a loving homage to what came before. Everything here is at operating at full power to create the ideal reboot that's great on it's own terms.Everyone here is so perfectly cast, embodying the key parts of their characters and still making them their own. As they are essentially co-leads, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are the standouts. Pine has the charm of Kirk in spades with a yearning to be more hidden behind the cocky exterior. Quinto nails the cold and calculating nature of Spock that masks all the pain, wit and rage that comes with his human side.J. J. Abrams is a real showman as a director here. He really knows how to build to an epic moment and is a master at juggling multiple things at once. With Dan Mindel's cinematography every single scene is dynamically staged and with editing courtesy of Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey the pacing is flawless. It feels like the film has been trimmed down to just it's core components and yet it doesn't feel even remotely rushed.The CGI is amazing, every penny of that $150 million budget is seen on screen with immensely detailed and gorgeously rendered starship designs. Michael Giacchino's score boldly goes into uncharted territory to create music that feels completely unique within the greater franchise. To put it simply, Star Trek has never sounded better than his work on these films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The hard core science fiction is back in the saddle !,"If this is the future of science-fiction genre, then Thank God for JJ Abrams.The new Star Trek is a rare achievement , as its too numerous individual parts are simply astounding, read, never has a film of this genre reached a quality of ultra-real photography, and being a science fiction ,this means a whole new ballgame ! Namely , the attention that the wizards from ILM have given to the most minute details is beyond belief ( i. e. - The Enterprise entering the battle zone smack into the countless floating debris of other ships , the concept design of its interiors - slick , but still ' ungainly ' , as based on the existing technological solutions - pipes , tubes , valves and counters, the lack of room , the bustle and hustle , too bad you can't produce the smells !- simply , the transportation of present into the not too distant future is visible in every shot ,the smart restaurant menus with familiar logos on them ,etc.etc.) .Even the choice of mostly unknown actors , at least to me , is superb , as every one of them shows a great talent , love for the past series , and brains ! On the negative side : the storyline gets a little bit confusing with the warping of time and singularity effects , but , hey , surprisingly , it won't kill your love for the film.And for the end : pay special attention to one of the wackiest scenes in history : the ' space diving ', incredible idea,and its execution!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Epic,"I think i watched this movie already 10 times and i can easily call myself a Trekkie. This is a masterpiece regarding Star Trek Saga, how the plot is set is amazing and you can find everything a Sci-fi movie should give the audience in this movie.

Musics are awesome, perfectly aligned with the movie course... Movie binds you to your seat from start till the end and you don't really want it to end at last, believe me... You feel a warm breeze of Nostalgia in your bones time to time and at the same time you feel how elegant a reboot can be done in your heart.

Too many lens flares ;),"At this point, everything has probably already been said about this movie, but I'll add my two cents anyway.I've recently become a fan of Star Trek (TOS) and I liked this modern take on the classic show a lot.But let's just start with the annoying element. I was well aware of this movie's reputation regarding the overuse of lens flares and I must say that that this reputation is far from undeserved. I have sensitive eyes and some scenes really hurt the poor fellows.Now this is said, let's move on to more interesting aspects.I wasn't very interested in the action sequences (especially the big ones), but that's my personal tastes, not necessarily a flaw on the movie's part.I was much more interested in the characters, and in that respect I wasn't disappointed. I thought that we could really believe that we were seeing younger versions of the characters from the original series. The blend of truthfulness to the originals and modern sensibility was very well done.My favorite character in this movie was Chekov. It helps, of course, that Anton Yelchin has been a favorite of mine for a while (I still find it hard to believe that he's no longer with us). I don't have enough words to say how much I loved the scenes they've written for him and Yelchin's acting. But I had been, before watching the movie, the most anxious to see how the trio of Kirk, Spock and Bones would be portrayed and I was more than pleased with the result! Uhura was very good as well, even if her role was somewhat small, and I hope that in future films there are more (good) female characters, because in a modern movie it seems weird to have almost only men in the main cast.Anyway, the distinct lack of bad actors in this movie is one big reason why I enjoyed it so much.The tone felt a bit weird at times. There were goofy moments that reminded me more of Marvel movies than of the Star Trek I know (which is limited to the original series so far). But I am, after all, a fan of Marvel movies, and I'd rather not have a blockbuster that takes itself too seriously. It is entertainment, after all, and we still had good moments of emotion and tension.I can't wait to see the sequels, now!Oeuvre_Klika out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The definition of ""generic""","I have now seen this movie twice. Both times I have forgotten almost everything that happened within minutes of it ending. It is easily the most generic sci-fi action flick I have ever seen that is void of everything that makes Star Trek great. There is no sense of wonder, discovery, or learning more about the human condition. It's a generic sci-fi flick with a Star Trek label. Nero is an uninteresting villain who is a generic over-the-top evil villain who just wants to commit as much genocide as possible. There was no real growth in any of the characters in the film, how they started is how they ended in the movie. It is just un-interesting and takes way too long to get going, as in, over an hour. Honestly, I think it's biggest problem is that it feels more like a prologue rather than a first installment in a franchise.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Modern Sci-Fi Mastepiece,"Star Trek 2009 is a fantastic film, it spawns a new telling of the Star Trek story from th 1969 tv series helmed by director J.J. Abrams. Abrams reimagines all of these character full filling there famous roles. The casting in of the character was so carefully handled, not just to fill the shoes but to breath life into Abrams vision and take. From the opening of this film it is hard to catch your breath. The Film is full of excitement and spectacle with a concise and neat story. Throughout the movie he characters are aleays faced with problems and are forced to work together and this makes very good relationships between the ensemble cast of characters and develops the characters. The cinematography helps with the pacing a lot. Sweeping shots on the bridge and dutch angle accomplish this. The shooting style is very busy, often times, more than one problem will arise for more than one character in the same shot. This creates a sense of urgency and momentum while aiding in character development and it never feels too bloated. The Score by Michael Giaccino is very underrated and undervalued. The main theme is very memorable and brings excitement with character victories and also helps with the pace from the get go. The visual effets hold up to this day, they seem almost flawless. I highly recommend you watch it or if you haven't seen it recently, watch it again",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Addictive Movie,"If only more movies could be made like this I would be in sci-fi heaven. The movie goes beyond science fiction with an action packed pace, drama and comedy all thrown in with very likable timeless characters. Sometimes it all just comes together and it does in this movie. This is the only movie I have watched 10 plus times and still I'm not bored with it. One of the most important keys for me is an emotional connection YOU FEEL FOR THE CHARACTERS. From the initial gut wrenching decision to save wife and baby KIrk to Spocks dealing with planet destruction. Secondly BELIEVABLE story, intelligently written.. tying in new with the old.I thought I would be watching the third sequel by now WHAT HAPPENED???The director did an amazing job and brought the action, pace, emotional, believable to the screen to make this an epic DEFINING MOVIE of the Decade..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good for what it is, but missing a lot","""Star Trek"" is good for what it is, which is boys' space opera, and on that single level it satisfies the senses. J. J. Abrams is a director with the common touch, the ability to reach a mass audience without appearing to patronize it. All the same, the movie is missing a lot of things that even boys' adventure stories should have.Most obviously, it lacks a subject. The Star Trek series was always about something; this movie isn't about anything. It has no moral, no message, no point to make about human experience; and although its plot would seem to require that it show the maturation of the two main characters, Kirk and Spock, it doesn't: they remain the same at the end as at the beginning, like comic book characters. As a result, although the movie runs two and quarter hours, one leaves it with a sense of having seen less, about enough for one episode of a Saturday morning cartoon.Also, the movie has no beauty, even of the mechanized kind. A lot of techno movies, and even anime, offer alluring pictures along the way; here all the mecha and the architecture, while not particularly true to life, are more like engineering designs. The film-making is similarly workmanlike: it keeps the action going, but without grace or lyricism; it does the job, and that's all.Finally, the movie dumbs down and vulgarizes the series unnecessarily. And although Spock is pictured exactly as on the series, Kirk has been turned into a hard-drinking, hard-loving hell-raiser, who never turns into the Kirk we know and love (or tolerate). Yet, oddly for such a character, he seems to have only three acquaintances, and even the progress of his relationships with them isn't dramatized. We get only a handful of illustrative moments, one-offs, like comic book panels. The same is true of his training at the academy, and indeed of most of the other elements in the movie.The script is credited to the executive producers; Abrams can write better than this; I wonder why he didn't redo it himself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's very good!,"I am a fan of Star Trek original and Next Generation, therefore I am god when it comes to judging all things Star Trek. This is as good as one would expect from Hollywood, nay...Gene Roddenberry who would recognize the extraordinary effort in to turning the 60's TV series and subsequent movies into the next sequence of Star Trek capitalistic bravura. Both James T Kirk and Jean Luc Picard would approve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek: Resurrection...,"Let me just start off by saying this is NOT your grandpa's Star Trek, or your older brother's Next Generation. This is a completely new and refreshing take on the beloved series of old, and, man, it sure delivers!I am NOT a Trekkie, although I've seen most of the movies. Having said that, the story is well-told, the screenplay by Transformers penners John Brancato and Michael Ferris is solid, and there are fine and loyal performances abound. The standouts are Zachary Quinto as Spock, wise as ever, but most surprisingly Chris Pine as Kirk. His performance is one of the very best factors of the movie; not only does it show his characteristics in the series, it also adds a new trait to his already recognizable character; adrenaline junkie. The rest of the cast deliver (again) fine performances; Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Eric Bana as the truly villainous Nero, Zoe Saldana as the gorgeous Uhura, Anton Yelchin (in a somewhat ridiculous Russian accent) as Chekov, John Cho as Sulu (good to see Cho in his first action scene), and Simon Pegg as Scotty (which is one of the very best comic-relief film characters in YEARS). Rounding up the cast is a surprise appearance by Winona Ryder as Spock's human mother, Bruce Greenwood as the Enterprise's first captain Pike, and last, but not least, Leonard Nimoy as the original Spock, whose character bridges the gap between the old and the new Trek.I'm surprised that a summer blockbuster has its plot driven mostly by strong characterization, not to mention making some cheesy moments smart. I'm even more surprised that the cheese factor is very low for this one!The cinematography is big in scope, the editing is fluid, and the production design is beautiful. But there are three technical aspects that deserve the highest merit for making this film great:1. The special effects. Eye popping from start to finish. Immediately after the studio logos end the action starts on the screen and rarely relents from then onwards. Superbly designed, colorful, and sumptuous nonetheless, the SFX makes the action more thrilling, as the CGI is crisp and extremely realistic. So far this is a future contender for a Best Visual Effects Oscar.2. Michael Giacchino's orchestral score. His music is simply epic. Throbbing, dynamic, and glorious, the man knows how to make music and definitely how to make it work. It adds tension and excitement to the film.3. The film would not have been the success it would have been had it not been for one man and one man only. And that man is director JJ Abrams. Not only is he the right man for the job, his epic direction puts all the elements together to make one hell of a summer blockbuster. Really, if not for J.J., who else? So, to pen off, this is the first REAL blockbuster of 2009 (it beats the living CRAP out of the merely OKAY ""Wolverine""). It has enough action to put in three blockbusters, and it has enough effects to fill two. It has strong character development, excellent action and timing, brilliant special effects, and something new and familiar for Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike. This is the Star Trek film I've been waiting for. No cheesy lines or cheesy action. No (too) melodramatic speeches. I may not be a Trekkie, but I will definitely consider myself and others who like this film a ""Neo-Trekkie"", and will look out for the next voyage of the Enterprise, so as long as the cast and/or Abrams stay on board.Welcome to the ""new"" Enterprise.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Something about Romulans,"*****This comment may contain Spoilers*****One small point regarding, Nero, the Romulan character from the future. Romulans were first introduced in an episode from the original television series titled ""Balance of Terror."" In that episode the entire bridge crew was stunned to learn that Romulans actually looked like Vulcans. Up to that point no one, in Star Fleet, had ever seen a Romulan. Interesting point considering that a vengeful Romulan from the future is so central in this current Star Trek feature. ""If memory serves,"" this is also where the Star Trek lore, regarding the Vulcan origin of the Romulans, began. All this is quite minor consider the visual wow factor of the current feature.Additionally, the concept of Transwarp, according to Star Trek lore, was first discovered by Spock. This is based on events that occurred in the original television episode titled ""The Tholian Web."" The term ""interphase"" was used to discuss travel between our universe and the alternate universe discovered in that episode. Beyond that, the current Star Trek feature is quite spectacular and well worth the viewing. I took my nephew and he is now hooked on the franchise.

Star Trek 09 - A Great Movie That Revisits the Classic TV Show Theme,"First off, I would like to say that I am a young but big fan of the original series and movies. I love the entire original cast and anything else just feels wrong to me. I've been very skeptical about this movie but because of all the hype, I decided to go ahead and see it. Amongst this, I wanted to give it a fair shot and not be biased against the new and young actors portraying the original cast. Well I have to say this movie delivers! I actually enjoyed it more than a few of the original six Star Trek films (not everyone of those movies was great if you seen them). One thing that's significantly been improved was the CGI which has sadly always been a burden for the original Star Trek movies. I thought special effect's were going to ruin this film though, by being over dowsed with it. But they don't! The classic negotiating and conversation that the original series had still exist in this movie.Another thing I really loved in this movie was the sound. Being a hobbyist music and sound producer, I think sound and music is a biggie when it comes to movies. The movie uses all the classic sounds from the original series and it throws in the classic, addicting TV show theme in at the end of the movie. Not only this, but visually, the uniforms, the Enterprise, everything was very accurate with the original series. This I like!Now to get on to some of the downsides. The biggest one... this movie was missing the original Captain Kirk! I don't care who you are, if you don't support the fact that William Shatner should have been in this movie, then you are not a true trekkie. I would have gladly rated this movie a 10/10 if Shatner was in it, but beings he was missing from the story, I cannot give it a perfect score. On the other hand, it was very nice to see Leonard Nimoy back one more time and hear his words of wisdom, but he is the only one of the original cast we get to see, although the storyline may have not made sense to throw in anyone else. Another thing that bothers me is the beginning of the movie with Kirk and Spock growing up. I felt that this area of the movie could have used improvements, especially with the very lame car chase scene. In the Star Trek universe, there is no law enforcement. And what's with the old car? This was a part of the movie that made little sense.I was overall happy with this movie but I will never forget the original cast who made the franchise so huge and I will continue to watch the original series. The movie is missing the 60's vibe and feel and it still feels wrong with so many of the original cast members missing. The portrayal of the original cast is almost dead on, especially with Checkov (his voice is a perfect match for the original). Zachary Qunito as Spock was excellent and Chris Pine played a perfect, egotistic Captain Kirk without trying to imitate Shatner. I recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans, young and old. It's still better than Next Generations if you are not a fan of Captain Picard and I think the movie should be given a fair chance. It's a nice flick and I just hope that it doesn't get thrown in the trash like the Lost In Space movie remake did!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great effects, good casting and a plot that didn't suck","Visually dazzling.Frenetically paced.And amazingly, the plot did not suck.These may be among the thoughts you'll be having after watching this sea-change in the Star Trek franchise from Bad Robot and Paramount.As a fan of the original TV series, I was deeply concerned about how this universe and its characters would be handled by the studio, writers and director that brought us such turds as 'Cloverfield,' 'Transformers,' and 'Felicity.' 'Star Trek' is supposed to be the thinking-man's sci-fi. Oh sure, there's always the occasional bug-eyed monster, but the conflicts typically depicted in the TV show were of ideology, history, or conceptual science. In episode after episode, Kirk and his crew began their next adventure by having all their fancy weapons rendered useless by some overwhelmingly powerful set of circumstances and would invariably end up having to conceptualize their way out of a jam. That show's creators knew it was the human capacity for understanding that was the key to our future. Technical understanding, yes. But ethical and spiritual understanding, too.So when I saw trailers for this supposed prequel with spectacular effects, collisions, and a young Kirk reinvented as Dennis the Menace, I was dubious to say the least.And right away, my worst fears seemed confirmed. Ignoring any sense of pacing and story, we're dropped right away into the middle of some slam-bam action sequence jammed with quick-cut edits of people screaming, sparks flying, space-ships flopping around and big puffy explosions. In another opening sequence, a raffish, perhaps eleven-year-old James T. Kirk steals his step-dad's 20th century car and proceeds to drive it off a cliff – right after leaping out of it. Then a perhaps 20-something Kirk boozes his way into a bar fight over a girl and gets his clock cleaned.No.My Captain James T. Kirk was a daredevil only in his spare time. Always an ambitious climber, tactician, and scholar first. A 23rd century cold warrior who knew how to take orders as well as bend them. Oh sure, he might have raised a little hell at the academy now and again, but always more a grade-grabber than ass-grabber.How did this film win me over? Everything it does right it does really right: Jaw-droppingly realistic effects sequences, smart casting, crisp acting and just the right tone for all the inside jokes and homages.When our heroes are forced to parachute onto a titanic space-drill dangling in the stratosphere over the planet Vulcan, it's about as realistic and eye-popping a sci-fi scene as a movie-goer could hope for.In case you missed the trailers, we meet all the original characters from the TV show as their careers begin aboard the USS Enterprise. Obviously, they could not have been played by the now greatly aged cast from the old TV show. A circumstance bound to breed hesitancy, especially among fans. But not only do we buy the new actors assigned to these old roles due to some uncanny physical resemblances, but we embrace them utterly the second they evince the slightest familiar affectation of each beloved role. When Karl Urban's updated Dr. McCoy winces and mutters ""You pointy-eared hop-goblin,"" after a frustrating exchange with Spock, you buy it hook, line and sinker. We catch only whiffs of Bill Shatner's Kirk from the largely untested Chris Pine. But who really could adequately fill William Shatner's shoes? The real star of this film is Zachary Quinto's Spock. His performance never misses a note in capturing that character's inner demons and new challenges.Where does this updated 'Star Trek' go wrong? First: pacing. Apparently it would kill the makers of this film to give us a breather or moment's rest from or reflection on the endless action sequences that crowd up this film like rowdy teenagers at a frat party. Give us a break already. Establish a scene. Set a tone. Gimme a chance to re-fill my Coke.Second: Violence. Not just violent scenes, but the violence done to the vision of the Star Trek universe. In the 1960's, Gene Roddenberry envisioned a more evolved human race that had more fully embraced the virtues of calm reason, personal dignity, and unwavering good will. This film's fleet cadets routinely swear, misbehave, and otherwise act coarsely or callously. It's a little disheartening and I preferred it when we had Roddenberry's future to aspire to.Third: theme. With the exception of 'The Voyage Home,' it seems like every Star Trek movie since 'Wrath of Khan' has involved some personal vendetta between a Starfleet commander and some ticked-off alien. Sadly, the present film is no exception. I understand Hollywood probably thinks it's risky to bet box-office returns on the intelligence of the average American movie-goer, but it can't be any worse than churning out the same silly vendetta story over and over. I'd prefer they challenge themselves to challenge us all with a fresh story more reminiscent of the old TV show.What ultimately saves this film from its otherwise equal balance sheet of pros and cons? A little thing called story. Beneath all the glammed-up effects and winking Hollywood smart-assery, is an actual story about actual feelings involving conceptual science. And this (air-quotes) ""story"" actually manages to explain everything from Kirk's new raffishness to Spock's new humanity. It respectfully, almost reverently ties this new franchise to the old and we are left feeling eager for the next installment.If this franchise's writers and directors can stay focused on the Star Trek tradition of stories that make its audiences think a little, it will hopefully live long and prosper.This movie review by Erik Gloor",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

They throw in a few lines from the original TV series but not too many to make it cheesy. This movie cant be exactly like the original series which is just fine. YOu develop an admiration and feel a kinship to the new cast almost immediately. The special effects are awesome. In this age of Fake Looking CGI, there is none of the CGI garbage.

All of the actors had the characters down pat in a way that was believable and not a parody.

Takes this tremendous challenge head-on,"Renewing an old series is one of the most difficult challenges for a screenwriter. The audience is familiar with all of the previous stories and the series' complete iconography. So the bar is very high. Plus, the reason you are renewing series is because the mythology has been told to death. So coming up with a new story that both pleases and surprises the die-hards is extremely difficult.Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman chose to go with an origin story, which seems so obvious I wondered why the Star Trek powers hadn't done this a long time ago. Oftentimes the origin of a superhero or superhero team is the most fun part, not only because we get to see how this special magic first came into being but also because the story is, literally, original. Every other story after the origin is essentially the same tale but with a different opponent.But origin stories are also a lot more difficult than they appear, as the writers of Watchmen discovered. Audiences love seeing the formation of the original team, but if you take too long doing it you kill narrative drive. And once you kill it it's real hard to get it back.Star Trek's writers solved the problem of renewing this ancient (by Hollywood's standards) series, and executing a good origin story, by grabbing some of the best techniques of science fiction, myth and drama. Science fiction often piggy-backs on the myth form. That's why so many science fiction stories use Greek and Roman names, stories and history. Myth is the best genre for telling a story that covers a great deal of space and time, and science fiction is the futuristic form that typically covers huge amounts of space and time.Like all genres, myth has certain unique story beats that must be present if you want to execute the genre properly. For example, many myth stories begin with the birth of the hero, followed immediately by the death of the father. Sure enough that beat happens in the opening scene of Star Trek. And its followed by every other major beat in the myth form.The writers keep the story from being a predictable myth-repeat by adding some of the key beats of the science fiction form, especially the elements of time travel. Due to Gene Roddenberry's original premise of ""Wagon Train in space,"" Star Trek has always emphasized the spatial aspects of science fiction, as the Enterprise visits one new world after another. As the show's tag line states, ""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before."" But this Star Trek is directed by J. J. Abrams, co-creator of Lost, whose brilliant fifth season has used the element of time travel better than it's ever been done before. In many ways, time travel is the key to rejuvenating the Star Trek franchise and making the origin story work. Time travel allows the writers to emphasize character change in a very plot-heavy genre – of many of the major characters – by jamming the characters' beginning and ending selves close together in time. It also lets the writers keep the narrative drive going fast and furious from the very opening on. Instead of spending the abnormally long time collecting allies that origin stories usually require, the Star Trek writers can sprinkle the introduction of the various team members throughout the story.The final genre the authors of Star Trek used was drama. Mixing in drama elements is the main way you transcend any genre, because you are essentially taking a mythic hero and adding psychological depth and individuality. This is the main technique writer Tony Gilroy used in writing the Bourne films, and what Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis did when called on to rejuvenate and rewrite the origin story for James Bond in Casino Royale. In Star Trek the writers not only highlighted the moral and psychological needs of main characters Kirk and Spock, they also made the brilliant dramatic move of turning Kirk and Spock into lead opponents for a good part of the story.Most of us writers never get the opportunity to rejuvenate a classic like Star Trek. But we can take on the challenge of telling a science fiction story so it has tremendous emotional impact on the audience. The choices the writers made in the new and improved Star Trek can teach us a lot about why science fiction has become one of the most popular genres in mainstream Hollywood film.FOR MORE REVIEWS please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The New/Alternate Generation,"JJ Abrams is a smart director - at the least smart enough to know what makes the original Star Trek show from the 60s, as well as the movies at their best (see Wrath of Khan thru Voyage Home), appeal so strongly to everyone from hardcore trekkies to just your average TV or movie-going public at large. It's a good script. Smart, actually, enough to try and give some new ideas or at least give us some characters to give a damn about. In his revised version of Star Trek he starts at the beginning, only an alternate beginning: it's still Kirk, Spock, ""Bones"" McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and (for a little while) Scotty, but there's some slight changes, alterations in the lineage thanks to a meddlesome, incredibly ticked-off Romulan.In this case Abrams and the writers, Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann, get to have their cake and eat it in terms of story and character development; they can reboot a franchise right from the start but with some extra surprises. And because it treats time travel with a fresh perspective - you may be confused at first as to why Spock appears not only as his young self played by Zachary Quinto AND as the (formerly) one-and-only played by Leonard Nimoy - there's no limit to what can occur in a franchise that is only beholden to the original in terms of staying true to the characters, their methods and personalities, and the essential things that make Trek what it is with its ships, the federation, Klingons and Romulans, Vulcan, everything. It's a truly inspired screenplay written by people who love the show, and want to get right to the heart of the big behemoth to see what makes it tick.If there are any complaints they're mostly minor, in terms of technical things. Abrams, who's only previous film was the third Mission: Impossible feature, isn't always assured during the fight scenes and cuts around a little too fast and jagged to always take. There's also a pet-peeve that one can have with lens flare (you may know what it is, in layman's terms it's that blue and other colored light that comes in horizontal lines, of which in this film I lost count), which became I assume an artistic choice as opposed to a flaw, one that didn't serve the movie really well. And while it's definitely a step up for Abrams in getting top-notch performances, especially from young actors who are definitely getting their biggest breaks yet here (albeit some are already stars and character actors, some unknown by me), there's a treatment to the direction in the movement of it that is somewhat akin to TV. Sometimes this is not a bad thing in the slightest; whenever scenes out in space were shown, in big battles or otherwise, it was fantastic, spectacular footage, by far the best in the entire franchise. As for ""dutch"" angles and rapid-fire camera movements...But I digress, what most people will be concerned to know is: are these new kids the real deal? Do they fill in the shoes of iconic pop-culture figures like James T. Kirk and Spock and everyone else on the Enterprise? Without a doubt, they all rise to the challenge. Chris Pine is Kirk without having to submit to a Shatner imitation (save, arguably, for a couple of scenes like when he hits on girls or is doing the Kobayashi Maru test), and he makes Kirk his own through and through; he makes me thoroughly excited to see where he'll go in this rebooted series. Ditto for Quinto, who brings his own calm and intensity to a Spock that needs to rise up to meet his elder form right in front of him at one point. Others like Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, (of course) Simon Pegg and John Cho, they're all a pleasure to see not taking over roles as imitations, but just being themselves as the characters.So, Star Trek, this revised edition is up to the standards of a franchise that can concern itself with action and suspense and adventure, but is also as much character driven as it is with story. No matter what quibbles I might have with certain aesthetic choices, this is the best we've seen from this diluted and over-exposed franchise (I mean Trek in general, through all of its re-incarnations of Next Gen and Deep Space 9) since its previous hey-day in the 1980s. It's fresh, exciting, funny, and has smart action to go with its package.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Excellent Reboot of the Star Trek Franchise,"I have watched, read, and listened to Science Fiction, quite literally, my entire life. While it's not my only interest (by a long chalk), SF is my favorite genre.I watched the first run of Star Trek as a teen in the 60's. I loved it and tolerated the dismissal of the series by peers and parents as ""that Buck Rogers junk"". Now, Star Trek; the Original Series (ST:TOS), is held up as iconic Science Fiction, not to be challenged or changed.Star Trek 11 not only challenges and changes the fundamental premises of ST:TOS, but does so brilliantly with humor, excitement, and yes, romance. Additionally, there are more than a few unforeseeable twists and turns.All of the main actors give their characters wonderfully full, believable, and well-rounded existence. Their iconic relationships are developed logically and with sensitivity to the fannish sensibilities.There ARE changes. Major changes. But most are reasonably explained in the course of the film. Those changes that do not have explicit explanation, can be rationally inferred from the context surrounding them.The Battlestar Galactica series was successfully, and brilliantly rebooted. Star Trek 11 is doing the same for the Star Trek franchise. May it live long and prosper.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek is at the top of its game.,"Premiering on television airwaves in 1966, Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" was an allegory towards contemporary society; within this utopian future, a group of men and women of all races, free from the clutches of racism and sexism, would unite together ""to boldly go where no man has gone before."" ""Trek"" was powerful in its storytelling and reaffirmed the bold, unique powers of science fiction. Though ""Star Trek"" ran a measly three seasons, this failed television series boosted an influential legacy. With ten feature films under its belt, six TV series, comic books, and even a short-lived animated series, there's no doubt of the massive, influential impact this mythic universe had on popular culture. Warping to 2009, in an age where reboots and remakes run Hollywood, newbie director J.J. Abrams (creator of ""Lost"") leads a hip, modern cast in a new, ultra stylized reimagining of a television classic. Though Abrams' reboot is low on plot, ""Star Trek"" never fails from being a high-octane, hair-raising, pyrotechnic displaying, laser-tag chasing, visual effect showcasing thrill ride. ""Star Trek"" is at the top of its game.Twenty-two years after the heroic death of his father, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), an intelligent and often reckless young man, fills his time slurping beer and looking for trouble. After failing to womanize Uhura (Zoë Saldana) in an Iowan bar, Kirk, yet again, lances himself into a brawl with a group of overly confident academy students. Noting the fierce determination Kirk possesses, and his father's inherited bravery, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise, encourages the young, misguided Kirk to join the Starfleet. Knowing what little he has, Kirk, slightly hesitant, joins the Academy where he meets Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), a loud mouthed, paranoid physician who fears the coldness of space. Years later, Kirk, still up to his old, devious ways, is put on academic suspension after strangely passing Spock's (Zachary Quinto) exigent flight simulator. When a distress signal is beamed from the distant planet Vulcan, Kirk, dodging academic suspension, is smuggled onto the U.S.S Enterprise with the clever help of Dr. McCoy. Once on the sacred Enterprise, Kirk's journey towards captain of the Enterprise and the formation of his aggressive, platonic friendship with the half-human half-Vulcan Spock begins.Let's be honest here, over the years, ""Star Trek"" has been reduced to ridicule by the vast majority who think the series' mythology is one big, fat joke. The term Trekie (or Treker depending who you ask) even carries a negative connotation, we assume some middle-aged, convention attending, pimply-faced virgin, is the show's only target demograph. Unfortunately for those bashers, they never truly understood the power of this show or the power of the science-fiction in general. However, luckily for this franchise, J.J. Abrams' reboot, which is being marketed as ""not your father's 'Star Trek,'"" is surly to induct a new set of followers into this long established cult.One of the reasons why this film is works is because of its hip, modern cast. From Kirk, Spock to Scotty (ingeniously played by Simon Pegg), each member of the cast brings a newly-formed resonance to its character. ""Trek's"" modern cast are not the scripted-punching actors of the 60's, the revamped update features fierce, spontaneous characters who are driven by mesmerizing performances. It's genius in its casting. Even the villainous Nero (Eric Bana), who gets little screen time and quite frankly a microscopic amount of villain time, brings an enormous amount of energy to the picture. Zachary Quinto, of Heroes fame, too, is able to confidently recreate Leonard Nimoy's initial creation.Not only is the cast a marvel, but the film's technicality is amazing in its execution. Drowned in vibrant colors, slick architecture, and astounding set pieces, the film's production design is the stuff that dreams are made off. Director J.J. Abrams, who clearly has respect and enthusiasm for the source material, adds an alluring cinematic quality to every frame of this picture; he reaffirms the daring, stunning magic of movie making. ""Trek's"" Composer Michael Giacchino even manages to create an iconic score, replicating the unforgettable orchestrated sound of John Williams, is bound to take audiences back to the classic days of science fiction.It's an exciting movie that proves not all Hollywood movies have to be reduced to cheese. It's cold, hard hitting entertainment of the highest order; it's entertainment done right! In fact, this is the type of film that deserves to be seen two, three or even four times on the biggest screen you could find. Headed by a competent cast and crew, ""Star Trek"" is a rock solid production.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary,"When I was a very young girl, I watched the original Star Trek series. Since then, I have seen every episode and every film of Star Trek. I thought it was impossible to make a movie about Kirk, Spock, Bones and Scotty with a new crew, but JJ Abrams made something fantastic of it. I think this new crew has watched the old one very precise, when you close your eyes you almost see the old crew in front of you, especially Bones and Scotty. It is also a great movie for young people. A lot of spectacular special effects and a lot of humor! It is a very sensational movie with a great story.

This being my first Star Trek movie I can't comment on how Trekkies might feel about this movie, but if this is any indication of where the franchise is headed, I certainly hope with all my heart that there aresequels to this reboot of Star Trek very, very soon.

Star Trek Goes Kajal and Cloverfield,"I never saw in a movie from the period of color and sound that much Kajal on the actors eyes, except in Fellini's Satyricon. When I noticed first that Kirk's lid-margins are heavily painted with black Kajal, I took a closer look on the others - and I was astonished that there must have been used some kilograms, like in an old silent movie, because almost all lids are painted. So far, so strange.That concludes the biggest impression the movie made on me, except disappointment. I always hope for good new SF movies, and although I am a Trek fan I am open for new and unusual approaches. I enjoyed ST:ENT more than TOS, and i compassionate its termination much more than any other's from the trek universe. The same with Farscape and Firefly for the non-Trek lines.I hoped that this new movie will break the line of the soapy and faithfully TNG. And so it does, but in a very unpleasant manner. Awaiting a new and astonishing voyage with new ideas and visions, instead, I got old and stale time hopping stories with logical errors and plot holes as big as gas giants. After Nero's appearance the movie died for me. And Nero appears very early. After it is revealed that he's a miner, his invincible ship is obviously around a driller, and he waited 25 years (without doing anything than masterbating together with his comrades, I assume) for the unsure appearance of tottery old Spock (who could also come 250 or 250000 years later) through a singularity that was deployed without any need, because the supernova it should prevent already destroyed Nero's planet, I had to switch off my brain immediately to prevent suffering permanent damage (until there I let it run in a kind of power-saving state), after Kirk met Spock by accident on an icy world, which is within sight of Vulcan, but unaffected by it's cataclysmic Nero-initiated disappearance. Fortunately, because we learned then that there is something called trans-warp-beaming, which would eradicate any need for any further action except trans-warping a big grenade into Nero's vessel and make it boom (to hell with ol' Pike), and so on and on...I personally hate the shaky cam, I feel no increasing realism. Shaky cam is for private holiday movies, in reality my view of the world is compensated by my brain and steady even when the bus driver goes bananas. Why did the Trek world blame Shatner for his use of hand cameras in ST5, and why do they praise Abrams for the same now ?Furthermore, I had the impression that the production team had no love for their product. They made a brainless action trip around a bunch of youngsters, because youngsters on the big screen will draw youngstersWith cash-flow into the theaters, whatever rubbish is running there. Starting from there, they had no need to put some pieces of storytelling or sense for atmosphere into their bland soup. Yes, action here, action there, action everywhere, and some jokes for the IQ-60 audience. The Ninja Transformer Turtles are wearing Star Fleet uniforms, brouhaha.The best in this movie is Spock's father. His figure is a real improvement as it is the first time he is allowed to show that he has a relation to his son. The actor is perfectly chosen for his part.Kirk himself is also not bad in some scenes, but his quality as a 3d-chess player who can beat even Spock, I mean his gaming intelligence, is not shown in the least. He is simple a ruffian, and so is Spock. I highly fear a Sequel where they both continue spanking god-mighty Ferenghi from the future or inseminate dangerous Tribble females in this sappy alternate universe.I would have given more stars if there would have been at least a scene where Spock's artificial teeth set is shown in a glass together with the mysterious red matter floating around, as Nero's ultimate revenge to teach Spock why he really failed.Every other star above 4 I added regretfully through the years because of overlooking most absurdities mentioned above and thinking ""c'mon, don't be so hard, be thankful instead, it's a Trek-Movie at least"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great time at the movies,"Face it, the Star Trek franchise needed this, badly. The new Star Trek movie is fabulous, and will definitely find new fans and give the Enterprise a good shot of adrenaline. I know a lot of classic Trekkers (I always preferred that name) are crying blaspheme since it did not follow the true ""canonical"" history of the series and the original movies, but purists like that are not realists. Yes, Kirk's parents were murdered by an evil despot, he has a brother named Sam, and was originally on the Farragaut, not the Enterprise--at least that is the purist view. I can understand changes to the source material, but not in the show and movie's commitment to science. First, the warp drive works too well, making planets that were days or a couple weeks away now just a couple of hours. The other sin was Scotty's ability to beam something from one end of the galaxy to the next, even if one of those objects is at warp speed. Finally, one plot point of how Spock removes Kirk from the ship is ridiculously idiotic. However, the film has much more in the positive column. In this rebooted version by J.J. Abrams, Kirk's dad dies in the line of duty, allowing his pregnant wife to escape and give birth to James Tiberius Kirk. He is true to the maverick form portrayed in the original series, although he does not enunciate and hesitate in his painful over-acting. McCoy is also true to form as a cranky, old-fashioned doctor who is leery of new technology, especially transportation. My favorite (as it has always been) is the reboot of Scotty. Yes, he's still Scottish, he's still an engineering genius, but he's a lot more comical. Spock (Zachary Quinto), though, is taken in a different light. He must learn to follow his emotions and look to them. And we get all the phrases used: ""I'm given her all I got, Captain,"" ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist,"" ""Fascinating."" We get Captain Christopher Pike, Sarek, the Khobayashi Maru, and Romulans. The plot is that a Romulan Commander, Captain Nero (Eric Bana), travels back through time to exact revenge on the Federation. You see, the Spock we all know and love (Leonard Nimoy) was trying to prevent the Romulan sun from going supernova. However, he is too late, so Nero vows revenge and travels back in time to punish both Vulcan and Earth. This leads the Enterprise, commanded by Pike, to appoint Spock as acting captain and Kirk as the first officer. There are so many things that go so well with this movie. First, it is laced with action scenes blended with fantastic CGI effects the old television series could never duplicate. We also get the first taste of actually using the up and down mode with space as opposed to forward, reverse, and side to side. The audience is also treated to a more conflicted Spock. There is also a strong tension between Kirk and his Vulcan ally. There is a little romance, and some kick-ass space battles. There is also room for sequels (of course). Reading some earlier reviews, I recall seeing one calling this Star Trek the best prequel ever made. I agree. I can't wait for what's next.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does not disappoint!!,"I've been a TOS ""Trekkie"" for nearly all of my short life. Seen every movie, watched and re-watched every episode. I must admit, when I first heard that Star Trek was being revamped I was both excited and a little afraid. Would it be the same Trek I knew and loved so much already? Would it be better? Far worse? Was Star Trek ready for a revamp? Would Trekkies still like it, or would it be another flop that others could run us on a line with? My fears were completely unfounded.The movie is, for lack of more accurate words, simply stunning. It was a definite thrill ride and was extremely entertaining from beginning to end. Really, it was what the original Star Trek had always wanted to be but couldn't. There's only so much you can do when all you have is some cardboard and Styrofoam rocks set in a different colored background every week for one hour.The casting could not have been better, especially in the three major roles we were all looking forward to--Kirk, Spock, and Bones (the last of which could have been DeForest Kelley's son, he played him so well)--and Nimoy's appearance was, of course, the icing on the cake. Not only did nearly every beloved reference get immense approval from the Trekkie crowd, the few that didn't catch the references still found them fitting. In other words, everyone loved this film, even the kids in the crowd who'd probably never even heard of it.As a Trekkie myself, I feel compelled to address my fellows reading this: though this is not the Trek of old, it hasn't lost a thing in the revamp. Those who complain that the message of love and equality was been pulled from it, thus making it worthless, are only looking for a flaw. This is a different era with a whole new set of problems. Complexity is still there, it just isn't in the fact that races and cultures can mix, or rallying for the rights of women. Whole new questions of morality and sense of identity are addressed, topics for this day and age, and the transfer is truly a seamless and, in my opinion, great direction for the franchise.All in all, this is a great film, whether you want to believe it or not. Give it a chance! If for nothing else, the plot has a refreshingly realistic ""Star Wars""-ish feel to it for those looking for the go-ahead to cross over, but fans, enemies, and clueless laymen alike will equally enjoy this amazing epic of a film.

Star Trek Triumphs,"I'm 55 and grew up with this as a TV show. In later years I went to the franchise movies and enjoyed them. This film, however, is a cut above the rest because of its casting and story line. Well-edited and directed, the story has moments that are deeply affecting. (When one remembers that this is a fantasy film prequel that is no mean achievement!) My 86 year old mother was with me, and behind us were some teenage boys--a pretty broad demographic--and we all clapped at the end. From a casting point of view, the young Kirk was as charming and virile as ever, an uncanny-looking Spock was well, perfectly Spock, and McCoy and Scottie were terrific. And, without giving it away, who knew about Uhura? This movie delivers on all fronts and the cast and crew should be proud of their efforts.

A Well Done Re-Imagining Of The Star Trek Franchise,"When I first heard about this project, I must confess that I had my doubts. It seemed as if the Star Trek franchise had been worked to death and had run out of steam and would perhaps be better left as a memory. Why bother essentially re-making the original with all of the same characters. I must confess that I was wrong. This was very well done. Thanks to the presence of all the old characters (and I even appreciated the re-appearance of the old style uniforms from the original TV series) this had a very familiar feel to it, but the story that was developed (having to do with a Romulan who comes from the future to avenge what he perceives to be the Federation's responsibility for the destruction of Romulus) provided enough of a ""tweak"" on the characters (the time travel having altered the original timeline, of course) that while familiar this had as well a definite air of originality to it. The actors were well chosen for the roles. As the leads, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (as Kirk and Spock respectively) put their own stamps on the characters, but again still came across as the Kirk and Spock that fans of the old series remember. Even the lesser characters (McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura - they were all there) came across as ""the same but different,"" if that makes any sense. The story was well-paced and interesting. There was at times a bit of a ""Star Wars"" feel to this as opposed to a ""Star Trek"" feel, but that was presumably a reflection of the desire to appeal to a modern audience (and the earlier feature films of the franchise also fell into that tendency as well.) One thing that was lacking was any significant moral or philosophical reflection, which was often a feature of both ST and ST:TNG. This movie instead went for action, and did that well.Even given the differences in the timeline explained by the opening time travel, there were some things about the story that made little sense to me. Chekov was a 17 year old ensign? (He wasn't even around in the first season of the original TV series!) This meant that he was a commissioned officer while Kirk was still a cadet. And, of course, Kirk - as a cadet - goes immediately to First Officer and then Captain of the Enterprise? That stretched credibility a bit for me. There was also the problem that the story seemed to suggest that Star Fleet recruited its cadets (or at least lifted them into space) from Iowa? Nothing against Iowa, but ...In any event, the presence of Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock from the future was a nice connecting point, although one hopes that Nimoy disappears in the sequel. Nothing against him, but if this is a going to be a restart of the franchise, it's time to let the new group get on with it. Also at the end of the movie, it would have been a better choice to have the closing narration (""Space, the final frontier ..."") read by either (1) William Shatner, thus making a final connection, or, even better (2) Chris Pine as the new Kirk, rather than by Nimoy. However, on the subject of the ending, it was nice to hear the original theme music used so proudly. Good movie. It will be interesting to see if the sequel measures up and if this marks the re-ignition of the franchise. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loyal Yet Updated,"I've been watching Star Trek since I was a young boy back in the early days (late 60's) and I loved everything about this movie. The characters were exceptionally true to form and the updated action as well as some much needed additional personality (to Ohuru in particular) was exceptionally well-suited but not overdone. The narrative itself was entertaining, suspenseful and intriguing. Exceptionally well written, in my view. Let's hope the collaborators can come up with another one like this. I feel confident it will be a massive hit.I'd probably give this movie about a 9.6 out of 10. The one thing that was slightly disappointing was the voice of the young Spock. He just was far too boyish. He did a fine job with the part - but I think they could have scored an actor with a bit more richness, even though still youthful. I had a deeper voice at age 13 than this guy. I think that adds to the richness of Spock's character and logic - and that is central to the character. If that had been better, it would have been a 10 for me.The beauty of this film is that it was extremely intense and exciting - I suspect it would be enjoyable for even new viewers who do not know the back story.Yet, it threw plenty of 'bones' (literally and figuratively) to viewers in the characters of McCoy, Kirk, Spock, Sulu and the rest. Many classic phrases from the Doc, Kirk and Spock.The added centrality of the role for Ohuru was more fitting for our culture as well as extremely entertaining. Zoe Saldana - whew! She is gorgeous.

After Shatner's Kirk and Stewart's Picard I never loved another captain... until tonight. When I saw a Captain truly worthy of the name (don't even get me started on the unworthiness of Janeway) Granted this *is* Kirk, but it also isn't. Yes, there is time travel, yes there is a rewriting of the history, but if you have *ever* read comic books, welcome to the genre! This does NOT discount all things Trek. It does not dismiss what we know and love about the story, the ideals and the 'big dreams' that star trek gave us in the 60s. Men and women, blacks, Russians, whites all working together. Earth peaceful and stable... Star Trek is more than a TV show, it is an ideal... And this movie?

"Cool, eventful, envisioned and re-established movie","I've never been an avid follower of Star Trek nor Star Wars series. But I always remember when I was young how I got fascinated watching the older version of these movies in a defunct VHS format medias. I can't even remember the older version of the only Star Trek movie I've ever watched, but admittedly it was one of the best classic sci-fi films I've ever witnessed. I can tell that Star Trek has to have more lead compared to Star Wars. The latter considerably to be an entertaining film as well but Star Trek has the sharper phase and delightfully different attitude in its story. Forget to mention I didn't quite like much the remake of Star Wars, as how they were visualized and dramatized. I can clearly see the pale dramatization of characters in Star Wars than in Star Trek. This is the only variance I could see between the two. Though they undeniably equal in terms of effects, uniqueness of story and plot they have differences. At any rate, this fresh remake of Star Trek movie had got to be one you need to absolutely see. Chris Pine effectively characterized his role as the son of George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth), and Zachary Quinto had me reminisced a lot of his character as one of those Vulcan habitants. The story was also very much solidly established. I'm impressed how they managed to have such considerably effective paperwork of script to visualize this uncanny, heavy-effect sci-fi film. The crew certainly deserves a worth of a recognition and payroll for such job well done. I was enthralled and thrilled with the joyride of this film. The people, the acting crew had made their roles convincingly well and it is a great deal to be acquainted with their effort-full job. Eric Bana did get a grip of that antagonistic aura of a villain, somewhat confused, vengeful, cruel and honored. I consider this film to be a worthwhile choice of seeing over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Two Spocks for the Price of One,"A welcome energy boost to the zonked out ""Star Trek"" franchise, this entertaining space adventure proves a much better prequel than what George Lucas did to his ""Star Wars"" legacy.The literally rejuvenated Enterprise crew members - well cast with relatively unknown actors - are fleshed out just enough not to stoop to cheesiness, though the countless character expositions are way too much. But the emotional aspects work beautifully, while the revenge plot and the action scenes could have been more innovative. Anyway, the whole scenario - including the good special effects - is surprisingly believable and the screenplay finds the right balance between fun and earnestness, between homage and autonomy.Some more narrative surprises next time and we're in for a really good sci-fi movie series.6 out of 10 red matter attacks",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest. Star Trek. Ever. Period.,"As someone who grew up with the original Star Trek in syndication, plus the jump from the small screen to the big with the original movies, plus having watched TNG, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, I knew JJ Abrams had big shoes to fill with his reboot of the sci-fi series that grandfathered almost all of modern-day sci-fi.And Abrams proves himself to be the master of excitement, suspense and pure adrenaline action with this offering.The film is packed with clever homages to the original show and movies, whether it be snappy lines, such as Bones' famous ""Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor not a...."" to the Kobayashi Maru scenario.The cast is phenomenal, from Pine's Kirk, to Pegg's Scotty, Quinto's spectacular Spock, Cross' Sarek, and my personal favorite, Karl Urban as McCoy.Though the subplot is admittedly one we've seen dozens of times throughout the Trek Universe, Eric Bana nonetheless plays a great baddie, and what would Star Trek be without a villain out for supreme revenge.Whether you're a long-time Trekkie, or new to the story, this movie is what summer action flicks is are all about, and to date, this is the best picture of 2009.If IMDb's rating system went higher, I'd give this 14 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is head and shoulders above any of the other Star Trek movies that have been made. The tight script, very well casted actors, special effects. well, basically i can only echo all the other comments that have been made here.The best thing about it, is that it sets the scene for future movies, which i very much look forward to seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is simply the best SF movie ever made,"Watching _Star Trek_ this weekend was an amazing experience. It is not only extremely well written, acted and had amazing effects, but it tugged at emotional chords so long forgotten, I did not realize they were there.I was 13 and an avid SF fan in the Fall of 1966 when I first saw the television version of ""Star Trek"" -- and as anyone connected with SF will tell you, 13 is the golden age of Science Fiction. ""Star Trek"" was actually good, its universe was well thought out and it attracted not just good TV writers, but good SF writers. When ""Star Trek"" looked like it might be canceled after the second season, I joined in the letter writing campaign to NBC to get it renewed for a third season. And when the third season was such a disappointment, I gathered up my feelings, put them in a box and buried them.Watching _Star Trek_ 2009, that box of feelings burst out that box. This was not merely ""Star Trek"" revisited, or a new and improved ""Star Trek"", but ""Star Trek"" perfected. It was ""Star Trek"" with all the lightning captured in the bottle. I was proud, I was happy, I feel shivers and goosebumps multiple times, I was in awe of what was on the screen. Seeing Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu et al. in such heroic circumstances being more heroic than ever before was amazing. And the Enterprise, itself, coming out of warp drive with phasers blazing and photon torpedoes shooting to save the day was an emotional catharsis. I had to deliberately calm myself on several occasions._Star Trek_ is a good movie even disregarding the emotional strings it plucked for me. If anyone actually came to this movie cold (born in a box and never let out 'til now?) they would come away from it with the sense they had seen great entertainment. The story, the characters, the visual and emotional impact of the movie all came together here.Now for a few minor nits that could have been picked by paying attention to science adviser on the movie. Eta Carinae is the perfect candidate for a supernova, it could have been mentioned by name. A planet in another solar system may have had its surface sterilized and its atmosphere blown away, but it is doubtful it would disintegrate completely. The sequence and timing of a supernova and its effects could have been mapped out a bit better. A class M planet so near Vulcan so as to see it as a fairly large disk in the sky would make it and Vulcan a double planet. But overall the movie paid more attention to science here than I am used to (kudos for that, as well). Also, the Bones character was heard in situations a ship's doctor would not normally he heard -- apparently just to let him say some of his more annoying catch phrases from the original TV series.On Memorial Day weekend in 1977, _Star Wars_ was released. It made previous all science fiction films look pale and sickly in comparison. This Mother's Day weekend 2009 history repeats itself with the movie _Star Trek_. This _Star Trek_ movie stands head and shoulders above all SF movies before it. It is simply the best SF movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle","Satirical news provider The Onion did a bit on their website the week this film came out with the headline that (roughly) read ""Fans slate new Trek film as 'fun' and 'accessible'"" which not only allowed them to make fun of the previous Star Trek movies but also provide a good review of the new one. The new film doesn't deliver the goods when it comes to shots of men sitting talking around tables and other such Trek film standards but in fairness it could not do more to make it clear that this is a massive ""reboot"" of the franchise that, with one thing or another, had stopped being of interest to a lot of casual viewers.The better Trek films have always been the ones that have a bit of pace to them and plenty of action (2 and 6 in my opinion) but even these have slower, duller moments that come with the territory. Mostly this film strips them out and leaves little but action across the running time, making it quite a spectacle to watch and why it is one of the summer blockbusters I decided to actually pay to see at the cinema rather than catch on DVD (Wolverine – I'll catch you when I can rent you). To borrow a worn cliché – the money is all there on the screen and almost without exception it looks great and it is very easy to get caught up in the speed and scale of it all. I particularly liked some of the more imaginative shots and techniques that it used, making it much more engaging and adding a further element of freshness (which, if we're frank, the franchise badly needed). I will temper this by saying that at times there seems to be spectacle for the sake of spectacle – such as the creatures on the ice planet and the silly car scene with a child Kirk at the wheel – and this does make me sit back a bit and see it as effects rather than something I should get emotionally engaged in but this is the minority of the film.Another injection is the comedy. While it is careful not to out and out mock the originals, there is much to laugh at with plenty of good lines that subvert some of the things we know from the original films (""out of the chair"" being my favourite but there are plenty others). I can see why this may be a problem for some but it does make it a lot more fun to watch than the last few Trek films. That the narrative is not as good as the action or throwaway lines is not much of a surprise but it does still niggle a little bit, specifically when it has to rely on so much coincidence to keep things moving. The sheer entertainment value of the film meant that I didn't dwell on these things but at times the way the plot plays out does suggest a little bit of contempt for the viewer. Having said that, it is a smart move to have the time travel plot that allows for the time-line of events to come to be totally changed (a point that the film labours to point out in one scene, so that everybody gets it) because this allows them to make further films that focus on action over detail without the worry of messing up some existing Trek time-line detail.The cast surprised me in terms of how well they did – not least because the majority of them are not banner actors and indeed some of them I had never heard talk before (Urban's Bones is only known to me for his killer in the second Bourne film). Everyone does a sort of performance that allows us to know the character but doesn't get close enough to being an impression to be a worry. Pine fits the swaggering Kirk role really well and, although nothing here impresses me that much, he is very good as that. Likewise Quinto (Heroes) does a good job as Spock, managing better with the comedy impatience as well. Urban is as fun as Kelly ever was while Saldana makes for a very attractive Uhura (short skirt and all). Yelchin and Cho are quite fun but, as much as I like Simon Pegg, his wandering Scottish accent was so awful that it detracted from his otherwise funny performance. Both Greenwood and Bana add an older, tougher edge to the film, the latter being a particularly effective villain.The new Star Trek film may upset fans because it does jettison pretty much all of the existing story in favour of starting its own as well as throwing all its weight into action and fun at the expense of almost everything else, but for the vast majority of viewers this will be the film's big selling point. Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle. Great summer blockbuster.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An imaginary and fun time,"This reboot, and re-imagining, of a classic could have gone horribly wrong. It didn't. The visual mastery and smart casting choices would have been satisfying for 30 minutes has there not been more to this masterful undertaking. JJ Abrams did a great job paying homage to the cast, themes, storylines, and characters of the original series; however, he creates a world that the initiated can enjoy for what it is. His handling of the multiverse gives him the chance to alter some of the backstories, and that is ok-it works. The cast, from Chris Pines' Kirk to Saldana's Uhura are terrific. They all do a good job using their predecessors as a baseline, but making the characters their own.

That was fast! (Spoilers),"Star Trek was fast, even faster than The Last Crusade. Indy3 is one of my all time favorite movies, and I consider it to be the best popcorn movie there is. It is so fast and so good that you tend to overlook all the stupid things and coincidences and there are quiet a lot. For example, when young Indy whistles for his horse and right after the horse come the bad guys in the car. But the movie is so good, you just overlook all that stuff. Star Trek is faster, but it does not lend itself as easily to suspension of disbelief. The coincidences are too obvious. For example why SpockPrime and Kirk are on the same planet, same continent, same cave. It is hard to swallow that. Why does the black hole in the beginning lead Nero exactly to that time and place it does to meet the USS Kelvin, why Old Spock comes out of the black hole just in time so that Kirk is matured into a young man and is ready to battle Nero. These coincidences are grand.The character moments in Indy3 are top notch. Indy talking to his father aboard the airship, discussing their plan on the motorcycle and the end of course where Henry calls his son Indy for the first time and Indy subsequently lets go of the grail and can be saved. Those moments never feel rushed or too short, they are, just perfect. In Star Trek, they feel a little rushed, it is just about acceptable. And the character moments are not bad. They are very good, just a little too fast. They are so fast and they take place in odd places. For example when Spock leaves the bridge after his planet imploded, Uhura comes after him and they talk in the turbo lift. The same when Spock leaves the Bridge after he was relived of his command. He goes to the transporter room? Does not he have quarters? Perhaps they did not have enough money to build the sets.About the sets. In TLC the sets were perfect. You always believed that a certain interior set belonged to the exterior establishing shot. In Star Trek that is not always the case. The sets in general. I like them just so. The bridge is nice. What is absolutely unacceptable is the use of industrial locations for the bowels of the ship. You just do not believe you are still aboard the Enterprise when the action shifts to engineering or the shuttle bay. That pulls me out of the movie and that is not good.The action and the SFX in Indy3 are perfect. Granted, some of the special effects look a bit dated by now, for example the plane dog fight, but oddly enough it does not detract from the movie. (Some of the mate lines were removed in the DVD versions) The action sequences are inserted so seamlessly, they come and go so fast, you do not even realize that you are in one, and when you do, they are over. (plane battle, plane car chase, tank vs. horse) The action in StarTrek is pretty good and the effects are top notch. The life action and the FX blend flawlessly, also because the lens flare that dominates the life action cinematography is copied in the CG stuff. Were it not for the industrial interior Enterprise sets, the movie would feel completely rounded.What I do not like, and I am afraid that future movies will bring more of it, is the shaky camera and the quick cuts that Bourne 2 and 3 director Paul Greengras pioneered. You can not relish a good special effect when you do not see it properly. But hey, that is how Abrahms envisioned the movie, that is the way it is done. Certainly a great artistic achievement, to uphold the style, the pace and the look throughout the entire movie but it is to fast and flashy for my taste.J. J.'s character direction and scene setups are a double edged sword for me. Theere are good scenes, some very good, but the Kobayashy Maru Test was a joke. Could Kirk be more pretentious and casual when facing Star Fleet's hardest test? And little bit more seriousness would have made the scene much better and not degraded it into a mere joke. And it was too fast. Too slow on the other hand was the Spock, Kirk scene on the ice planet. Are not they in a hurry? Do not they want to find the outpost? Need not Kirk get back to the ship? Yet they sit there, having a talk and barbecue around a log fire. (Where did they get the logs on a ice planet. Christmas trees?)The music in the Indy movie was great, had the best music in any Indy movie, the best themes. The Star Trek score is great also, Kirk's theme is cool, the title theme is beautiful, although I missed the fanfare. I wonder why the film's composer was not allowed to use it.The acting was very good, the casting perfect. They had so many actors from so many different genres, their fans alone would have made the movie a blockbuster. But since the movie is so appealing to a general audience it is/will be a huge success. It will bring in a lot of new fans. The sad thing is, I think that most of the old fans, as myself, do not think the movie to be so good. And do not get me wrong, I do not think it is a bad movie, and I hope it will make a lot of money and bring us seven sequels, but as a fan, I am a little bit disappointed. If the movie took its time, if it was a little bit more traditional, it could have been so much better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The authentic casting makes this a must-see.,"If the main goal of Star Trek was to win over general audiences then I think they succeeded. With likable characters, top-notch special effects and a solid story, this nerd's epic hit the box office with the sonic boom from a roaring thruster. Zachary Quinto's Spock and Chris Pine's James T. Kirk are not only convincing but are near perfect in their matching to the original series. The characters are instantly recognizable by looks and accents and Eric Bana's Nero Romulan will drive fear into you and your planet.No doubt like all Sci-Fi remakes of our age, the die-hards will find something to diss on in the movie (I think these winners are called Trekkers). I mean it does miss the mark on delivering the stiff, robotic fighting and the flashing bulbs from the original series but for average Joe, this could easily be one of the best Space-Aged movies ever. Though the use of lens flare was a bit on the ""a little too much"" scale, the feel of the Enterprise's bridge and the relationships among the crew came off as genuine and well acted. My only regret in seeing it was not experiencing it in full IMAX glory.The scenes that struck the best chord with me was aboard the Enterprise itself, though the Space and explosions were pretty, the bridge had a feeling of advanced technology and I liked the look of the Romulans. Simon Pegg's Scotty and Karl Urban's McCoy will no doubt be fan favorites and Zoe Saldana's Uhura will have the young men in the audience drooling. The full cast really grips you throughout the entire movie and it was enough to make me forget that Tyler Perry was in the movie.So J.J. Abrams has pulled it off, he has taken the most nerdiest of obsessive nerd shows and made it absolutely watchable to the regular person. Although the speedy plot will not win any awards, the character interaction, menacing bad guys and the authentic casting makes it a must-see.More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, Great Movie!","I have never seen a full episode of Star Trek in my life, but when I saw the previews for this movie, I knew I had to go see it. It didn't disappoint one bit. The movie was filled with great storytelling, great action sequences, and the CGI was possibly the best I have ever seen on any film.I liked pretty much everything about this movie, from the gorgeous visuals to the surprisingly good storyline that was quite clever. If there was one thing I could change about this movie though, I would make it longer! When I sat down in the theater, I was expecting to be there for a good 3 and a half to 4 hours. It turns out the movie was only 2! It is still an amazing two hours though, I highly recommend going to see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's official:  Star Trek is in good hands,"I just got back from Star Trek. I said I would come to this with an open mind and I did. My conclusion in a nutshell?: The critics have it right, the purists have it wrong.First, let me just say that if you absolutely abhor fast paced action, suspense, and adventure, you will be disappointed. Because this thing is packed to the gills with it! This is far and away the most suspenseful Star Trek there ever was and J.J. Abrams pulls it off expertly. In fact, that and the flawless comedy were my favorite aspects of the film.Here's the thing: This is an ORIGIN film. That's the biggest drag on this movie, as far as I'm concerned. Origin stories/movies are never very interesting. The fact that J.J. Abrams and company can turn a normally dull and drab origin story into something entertaining is a testament to his craft. I'll tell you right now, throwing in a lot of suspense and action and comedy to boot into the mix is and was the only possible way the Director and writers could have made this movie entertaining. Otherwise, I could guarantee you that it would have been a flop much like the first Star Trek Motion Picture. So the fact that J.J. Abrams effectively used these tools to gin up the story was a very wise thing to do.I think I now understand why Ebert gave this movie a mixed review. Much like Spock is a hybrid Human/Vulcan, this Star Trek is a hybrid between Star Trek and Star Wars. I think Ebert is one of those old fogies who only wants it one way or the other. However, unlike Ebert, I have absolutely no problem with it. I like both styles to begin with and turning it into a hybrid of sorts makes it completely unique. A lesser director would have failed miserably at combining the two, but J.J. Abrams effectively melds the two together so that it seems like both parts naturally belong in this new Star Trek universe.Finally, the purists should thank their lucky stars that J.J. Abrams made such a great film. This is going to light a fire under the Star Trek franchise like you wouldn't believe! And by the end, it was VERY Star Treky. I can almost see the new and interesting adventures this newly minted crew will experience beyond the origin. The sequel to this feels like it's going to be even better and more interesting. I can't wait.Oh, and one more thing. The acting was absolutely SUPERB in this movie. The young actors did an exceptional job. Unlike the prequels to Star Wars that had the worst wooden acting I've seen, the actors in this movie disappear into their roles allowing me to truly enjoy the story. Their comic timing was flawless, as well.Go see it, already!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun adventure.,"There's an interesting divide between Star Trek fans about J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise. I see it as those who view the franchise as science fiction and those that view it as techno-fantasy.In my mind, Star Trek has never been science fiction. It's a fantasy world with switches and starships instead of wizards and dragons. They've made up the ""science"" from the beginning. Transporters? Fantasy. Warp speed? Fantasy. Phasers? Fantasy. Science has since gone to quasi-justify some of this, but none of the ideas were born of scientific rigor. Instead they were invented because Gene Roddenberry needed a cheaper way to get people to the planet surface in ""The Cage"" than a shuttlecraft, which they didn't have the budget to build, so they used an optical effect to have people appear and called it the transporter.And yet, many Trekkies disagree with me. Mike Stoklasa, of Red Letter Media, is very much on the other side and gets really irritated with the movies from The Next Generation on about how they don't keep to the science of the show. Windows shattering in Generations led to a couple of minute long comment about how they're not glass but transparent aluminum and have gone through so much more stress than landing on a planet. My response is to feign surprise at inconsistency in a franchise that is almost a thousand hours long.So, when Abrams introduced red matter, seeing a planet destroyed while standing on another planet, and a super nova that will destroy the galaxy, I shrugged at the ridiculousness while others raged. No, none of it is scientific, but neither are transporters.So, with that out of the way, let's talk about the movie itself.Time travel brings a mining vessel back in time right in front of the USS Kelvin and commander George Kirk. The situation quickly devolves and the Kelvin is shot to hell. Commander Kirk orchestrates the evacuation but needs to stay behind to give them a chance, forcing his wife and very newborn son to flee without him. This first ten minutes is so successful in terms of short form storytelling, I kind of wish that this was everything. It's clear, emotional, and wonderful to look at as George Kirk sacrifices his own life to save his wife and son.The rest of the movie isn't as strong, but it's still fun. Abrams has a zippy style that he ends up fitting well to his take on the material. People running around ships as they try to explain things to each other while amusing things are happening (like James Kirk's enlarged hands). Abrams wants to entertain in a propulsive way, and he zips along fast enough that we're just along for the rollercoaster ride.But, getting into the details of how some of the plot works out reveals this fantasy/science fiction problem in greater detail. The one to point out (because it inexplicably comes back in Into Darkness) is the transwarp beaming concept. On a planet, Kirk finds Old Spock and Scotty. Old Spock inputs a formula from the future into Scotty's computer that suddenly makes it able to transport people in ways that no Star Trek show has even hinted at being possible, across light years and to a ship in warp. No hardware upgrades necessary, apparently. The franchise has always existed on this border between the two genres, but, to take a political term, this movie moved the Overton Window firmly towards fantasy, and that bugs people. It also bugs me, but not enough to kill the film. It bugs me because, within this version of the universe, transwarp beaming invalidates starships completely. It was a quick solution to a plot problem without any concern for how the technology would actually work. It's silly.Still, the movie zips right past that and the action continues with people running down corridors.The real strength of the film is the cast. Chris Pine is affable as Kirk. Zachary Quinto captures Spock's essence. Karl Urban is note perfect as McCoy. Even Anton Yelchin is delightful as the seventeen year old Chekov. The movie spends so much time with our crew of the Enterprise that it ends up failing a bit with its protagonist, Nero.Nero's entire backstory gets told in one data dump about halfway through the movie, which Eric Bana growls through while threatening Captain Christopher Pike. It carries no emotional weight because it comes so late and is delivered so quickly and (nearly) incomprehensibly. The motivation there should have been enough to make Nero an interesting bad guy (although another motivation other than revenge might have been nice), but the delivery is kind of terrible. Our antagonist is really just a scowling guy who shows up every once in a while who hates Spock.Still, the movie is silly with a conflict that could have been better defined on one side, but it's still a fun two hours. The protagonists are uniformly likable and have great chemistry while the action is well staged and the movie is paced at almost breakneck speeds. It's rather unlike any iteration of Star Trek before it. I overall prefer the ponderousness of The Motion Picture, but I can take this new tone and energy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fight Scenes Surpass Those of Previous Pictures,"Honestly. Any trek fan wants a good storyline and expects the most from the characters but what a good film also needs are the fight scenes.The new Star Trek film has them.Incredible special effects combined with intensely and rigorously choreographed action scenes make up the bulk of the movie and are truly inspiring.This reminds me.Remember back in the day when Kirk (the Shatner version) would fight the Gorm? Well. Hate to break it to you but, swords and high-powered phaser pistols definitely beat the classic styrofoam rocks. Don't get me wrong. The Original Series was an incredible feat in its own respect but to see the evolution of the Star Trek Universe from the formerly mentioned to what we have today is a truly awe-inspiring example of how Gene Roddenberrys dream has come so far.Live Long and Prosper Fellow Trekkies \V/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
rewind on Star Trek,"As everybody is bracing for the second series of the new Star Trek series, I realized this is the right moment to see the first episode which somehow I missed a few years ago. I am a fan of the Star Trek TV series and movies, so there were little chances for me not to like this film. The passing of the torch from Gene Roddenberry who created the original series to J.J. Abrams makes a lot of sense to me, as I see in Abrams the successor of Roddenberry in creating science-fiction which keeps the right balance between science and fiction while adding human and in the best moments philosophical meanings to the action on screen, with an universal message that while the Universe may be infinite and the borders of knowledge just expect to be pushed further and further, the basic values that govern this Universe are the same, whatever form they wear.The story in this first series of Star Trek is a prequel to where the original series started in the 60s. Same as George Lucas did with Star Wars, we are being brought to an earlier phase of the conflict between the Federation and the Romulans, and we get to know all the familiar characters of the original series at an earlier age. Rigorous science was never the strong point of Star Trek, one accepts the conventions in order to enjoy the show, so the space travel as well as hint of alternate universes Abrams likes is used here as well, and it's not necessary to analyze it too closely to find some flaws. What counts is however the way the young actors build their characters and how they drive them towards becoming what we know that they will be in the series that began back in the 60s. The effects around are pretty standard for the space wars kind of movies, and the old tricks like the 'transporter' have kind of a 'retro' look. Here lies actually part of the charm of this film, and this balances to some extent the 'teens on space ships' moments, or even the 'intergalactic sex' scene (yes, there is one, not too explicit, do not worry).The presence of Leonard Nimoy as old Mr. Spock living thanks to some time travel tricks to meet his young self played by Zachary Quinto ensures continuity and connects well with the older TV series. Young captain Kirk is played by Chris Pine and I probably need to wait for the next series to see how he evolves into the character of Kirk as I remember him. A few good actors I know from TV series (Karl Urban, John Cho) add good supporting acting to the cast. Reasonable action combines well with nostalgia, but this combustible is already burnt out completely in the first episode. I hope that the coming series will find something new and interesting that speaks not only to the captive audiences like myself but also to the broader ones who were less exposed to large doses of the older Star Trek series and movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Warp Speed,"In death there is rebirth, the death of the Star Trek came to the screen as Nemesis. The movie that was reborn is Star Trek. This movie raised the bar for prequels and any Star Trek film, with the exception of Wrath of Kahn and First Contact. The acting was paramount, they fit the parts with perfection. The visual's were top tier, it wasn't shaky or anything like Cloverfield if any one has concerns. You feel like your in 2230, and everything falls in place, you see a higher budget Enterprise, the way it should be, you see actual parts of the ship and engineering things that the older movies couldn't have. The comedy is perfect, there's quite a bit of reference to the Star Trek universe for the fans, which brings me to my gripe about the movie.The only bad thing which is tiny, is if you know nothing about Star Trek, you will not Fully understand the villain, and his hatred will seem unjustified.

But what i've always been is fascinated with long running media franchises like Trek. And to make it possible for a franchise to be and stay successful it has to reinvent itself, which every fan should admit was the necessary and right thing to do for Star Trek at this point. IMO with this movie the task to give another Generation it's Star Trek was a absolute success, which should make everyone who likes the series happy.Of course, the movie had its problems like obviously trying a little to hard plotwise, as well as far as the drama goes. But what made the movie as entertaining as it was to me was the balance, which from my point of view pretty much every single aspect of it reflected. Starting with making it as much enjoyable for Trekkies as for your average moviegoer. I actually watched it with a hardcore fan on one hand and another guy who pretty much doesn't know anything about Trek other than Kirk and Spock. And they both liked it.Another thing was that they finally had some real good action stuff in there, but at the same time didn't forget to develop the characters. Furthermore did the movie not take itself too seriously, had a good amount of humor (something i've always liked about the later movies with the original crew), without being cheesy.All in all, the only thing left to say is, that Star Trek is definitely back to live long and prosper.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good Followup On The Original Premise,"Having never been a Trekkie, I approached the latest in the long line of films and television shows with no real love for the genre. I was hoping that at least the special effects might be good; they generally are nowadays. With a story of some interest and intriguing cinematography there's little wonder that is a box office hit.What we have for a plot is an almost bewildering blending of the past, the present and the future, all stitched together in a satisfying manner. But unlike the concurrently running ""Angels and Demons"", this plot is actually believable, even though this is science fiction. The difference is the pacing and ""Stat Trek"" has no trace of conspiracy; the enemy is well defined right from the beginning.What is definitely fun is that we meet the main characters of the film early on in their formative years; James Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and even Dr. McCoy all reveal something of themselves. We now know a little more of how they came to be the crew of the Enterprise.The effects are quite remarkable, and any fan of space adventures will be satisfied with them. There is a plot point involving time travel that is the only blemish on the narrative; this seems to be like the use of magic in movies. Contrive a difficult situation and have characters saved by supernatural imposition. The artful dodge of movie making.This is probably the smartest of the summer blockbusters.Three stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.","The new Star Trek is all consuming - undercutting low expectations with a colourful landscape of rich visuals married with pace and driven by kinetic flair both in front of and behind the camera. Abram's Mission Impossible looked flat and felt static but Star Trek really moves with swooning camera movements, conspicuously eye catching composition and a degree of self-confidence that scoops you up and carries you along for that Hollywood Holy Grail – ""the ride"". There's artistry in its visual effects, an omission from most blockbusters, and the design is a combination of craft and graft, contrasting the smooth sheen of the Enterprise's bridge with her new boiler room bowels. Its future tech with a touch of real world grease and it speaks to the filmmakers intentions of partnering the geek aesthetic with something less esoteric for the unconverted.Ironically for a movie that turns on future proofing legacies, the film's weakness is its story that feels slight and is driven by the commercial requirement to clear the decks for a new series of films – a deficiency that will become more apparent as time strips away its visual impact. Given that the script lacks any of the emotional or intellectual rigour that at least threatened to punctuate previous instalments, it does at least introduce a sense of fun and bravado that alludes to the best of the original series and it's more of a romp than before, signalling a new direction that owes as much to Star Wars, much apparent in the movie's dramatic thrust, as much to the series whose name it bears.Goodwill notwithstanding, there are elements to this new approach that won't sit easily with aficionados of the Enterprise. The decision to wipe out 43 years of continuity, well conceived but poorly explained and embodied in a villain who is more plot device than character, is a poor return on a lifetime of devotion for hardcore fans – and the philosophical and moral implications of Nero's actions are given a cursory shrug in the interests of moving the story forward, a treatment which makes the decision seem flippant. The humour is sometimes too broad in a bid to appeal to an imaginary constituency of barely brain-stemmed teens, though it frequently recovers, and those on product placement watch will recoil with the news that both Nokia and Budweiser have made it to the 23rd century – a feat all the more remarkable on account of the nuclear war that occurs in Trek's chronology between our present and the time occupied by the libidinous Captain of the Enterprise.Once the new cast settle into their familiar positions sometime during the final third, it feels natural and reassuringly familiar. Pine, retaining Shatner's cock sureness but dropping the melodramatic pauses, captures the spirit of his predecessor and is a worthy successor, though Orci and Kutzman could reward his performance by deepening his characterisation in the next instalment. Qunito's Spock is fine but lacks Nimoy's presence – how you miss the dulcet tones and Karl Urban's Doctor McCoy is perfect – instantly evocative of Deforrest Kelley without becoming an impersonation. True to the original series, the rest of the cast are little more than scenery, though the new Uhura is some of the best you'll see all year and certainly deserves more to do in future. Her sexually inspired turn adds a decent measure of human beauty to the gorgeous computer generated vistas.A sensory treat it may be, visual effects and production design spit roasting your optics, but the impact is undermined by the absence of an equally inspired score. Great genre movies are defined by their musical dimension – imagine Star Wars without Williams, Blade Runner without Vangelis but the paucity of great compositions in recent years suggests that as the previous generation of great composers falls away, no one is coming up to replace them. A movie on this scale demanded symphonic support on an hysterical scale – something akin to Goldsmith's intervention in the otherwise lifeless 1979 film, but instead it's a generic score that substitutes volume for melodic coherence and memorable motifs. You've heard the like many times before and will be pushed to recall a note of it afterwards. The composers will claim that the trend is now toward so called 'emotional augmentation' – atmospheric scoring rather than out and out musical enrichment of the narrative, but this reduces what was once an integral part of these movies to clinical diagnostic support and it's unworthy of the potential of the movie score and the art form's heritage.Exciting, inviting and a little bit frightening (the new Chekov's accent is as unsettling as any planetary destruction), Star Trek will polarise die-hards but have little trouble charming the uninitiated. It has scale, energy and a likable interplay between the leads, all of which go a long way toward apologising for some of the screenplay's less intelligible choices. Where it does succeed ultimately, is in evoking the spirit if not the intellectual curiosity of Rodenberry's series, and although we'll expect an extra dimension to the characters in the next instalment, there's enough optimism on display here to allow the filmmakers the benefit of the doubtthough just this once you understand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is a remake not a re-imagining.,"After finishing the movie it's clear that this movie isn't out to neglect the source material and completely create new characters. The creators of this movie took great care in giving Trekkie fans a nice Vulcan salute. This is a really great movie! I'm glad that Star Trek was put into the right hands. A disaster could have spelled disaster to a franchise very important to me and many, many others.Everything works out well in this movie. It has a fast pace. It's edited nicely. There's no time to waste scenes in this movie. This is also a very funny movie at some points. Especially a sick Kirk running around the ship with swollen hands and tongue while Bones is following him trying to cure him.This movie really doesn't disappoint.

"Finally, a Star Trek film that belongs on the big screen.","Let me first say that I am not a Star Trek fan. The movies always seemed like slow paced, made for t.v dramas. This film was quite the opposite. A faced paced action movie with a good story to boot. The best thing about this film was the acting. J.J. Abrams picked the right cast for this film. They made the movie fresh and interesting. I was never quite a fan of remaking a film, but I'm glad they did. The story would seem confusing to some (just ask my wife), but all your questions are answered throughout the film. For those of you who adore the original series, I believe you will enjoy this film.

a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak,"My opinion on the new ""Star Trek"" doesn't really differ from the general one. J.J. Abrams succeeded in making a reboot that's both fresh and respectful to its source material. He didn't experiment with the new technologies or complex narrative, but conveyed the dynamic, yet totally comprehensible storyline intersected by numerous allusions to the old series. You don't need to be a trekkie to fully enjoy this movie that can be described as humorous, fast-paced and universally gripping. The action sequences are never less than awe-inspiring. The transformation of James T. Kirk is entirely believable and unforced. Chris Payne is great in this role, just as practically everyone from the distinguishable supporting cast. ""Star Trek"" can be considered a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak, still it lacks certain kind of depth and emotion to be truly remarkable for me. Nevertheless, it's without any trace of doubt an essential viewing even for people who have not been particularly interested in this saga before.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Liked all of it except the whole going back in time bit,"The casting of Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock was perfect. Pine was great as this cocky up and comer and Quinto had the whole speech pattern down and look of the Vulcan. I liked the plot for the most part. It's about how Kirk and his fellow shipmates got their start on the USS Enterprise and how they landed their positions. They are battling the evil Nero whom is using red matter to create black holes to wipe out whole planets. But the whole part with this being a future Nero and a future Spock I didn't like. It made it very confusing.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining, very good special effects, worth checking out. All the whole transportation is used wisely in the film. Very cool.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth a look...especially if you're not already a Trekker,"The best job of casting they did in this movie was Karl Urban. He was more than convincing as Dr. McCoy. He had the mannerisms and delivery of classic ""Bones"" lines down pat. I found Zachary Quinto surprisingly adequate as Spock, though that is the best I can say for him. I found Chris Pine's Kirk very uninspired and Eric Bana's portrayal of the villain, Nero, surprisingly flat for an actor of his caliber. The only other bright spot amongst the cast was Simon Pegg as Scotty. While his screen time was severely lacking, when he was on screen he stole the spotlight with his masterfully delivered comedic lines.While overall, I did enjoy the movie, I felt like the writing was horribly lazy. Using time travel to create a completely different timeline where any kind of continuity could be ignored is a slap in the face to all those writers that came before Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and established the wealth of material we consider the Star Trek mythos. For someone completely unfamiliar with the Star Trek franchise, this could be a very enjoyable diversion, but for those who are truly fans of the universe Gene Roddenberry envisioned, this movie is cheap gimmick to re-image Star Trek, much the way Battlestar Galactica was re-imaged, but without the quality of writing of which the latter benefited.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good,"I saw this movie last week and it was awesome! Anyone could watch this movie - you don't have to be a trekkie to appreciate the visuals, story and acting. I have to say, the actors were superb! I was skeptical of the new and young looking Kirk until he actually came onto the screen and I have to say, he did a wonderful job. I thought he, Spock and McCoy and Scottie were just great.It was weird to see Karl Urban play the doctor as I'm so used to watching him in more action figure roles. However, he played his part really well. My favourite actor was Simon Pegg who played Montgomery Scott. He brought a new life and sense of humour into the movie. This movie does not have one boring moment. Eric Banner, who plays the villain, didn't have a very large physical role but all credit goes to him for acting it well. Great movie to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A solid ""reboot"" of the iconic franchise","To say that ""Star Trek"" is a cult phenomenon is an understatement of galactical proportions (ha ha, this time the pun is intended!). The fans of the famous series are the butt of jokes from every fabric of our culture (not only do they have a collective name, Trekkies, but TWO documentaries about them!). Their only rival in fan fever that they have is ""Star Wars,"" though I think many of them belong to both parties.For a long time now, old TV shows have been resurrected on the big screen. Not quite a remake, but a new ""version"". But ever since the massive success of Christopher Nolan's new vision of the ""Batman"" franchise, the term ""reboot"" is the correct lingo. So how does J. J. Abram's ""reboot"" of the ""Star Trek"" franchise measure up? Well, it's not Nolan's re-envisioning, although to compare any ""reboot"" to those films is unfair to just about any movie. Abram's film is a solid start to an inevitable franchise.Oh, there are flaws. Most of them are little things, like music carrying over when it shouldn't, mildly awkward cuts, and the like. But there are three BIG problems, which I will get to later.This is an ""origin"" story, and it feels like one. What makes this different is that it tells one story with one villain, as opposed to propelling the development of the characters through episodic chunks. This direction runs the risk of rushing the development or not adequately doing so, but ""Star Trek"" avoids doing this.James Tiberius Kirk is a rebellious young man who has accepted his lot in a life of meaningless existence. However, he is challenged by a Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join up with the space fleet. Of course, Kirk does this, but he seems more concerned with pursuing women than really working hard. This puts him at odds with Spock (Zachary Quinto), whose Vulcan side makes him a strict adherer to rules and protocol. Nevertheless, they are eventually put together on the U. S. S. Enterprise when they run into a nasty Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana), who has a nasty habit of turning planets into black holes. Now, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew have to save Pike (who was captured by Nero) and defeat Nero while not getting destroyed (or destroying each other, in the case of Kirk and Spock) in the process.This is very long winded, but it's relatively straightforward. At least until they insert time-travel into the story. Normally the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo is just frosting on the cake. Not here; it's an intergral part of the story, and I spent a frustrated 10 minutes trying to figure it out.The performances are where ""Star Trek"" really shines, and that's probably the most important part of the film. In order to sustain a franchise (which ""Star Trek"" will undoubtedly become, given the fact that every movie that makes even a dollar more than its cost gets at least two sequels), we have to like the characters and they have to be able to hold the audience's attention. Abram's cast does this, in a way that's actually better than expected.Everyone gives it their all. Chris Pine is great as the rebellious, somewhat cocky role as Kirk. He's a guy you can root for. The main characters in movies are typically the most grounded, and therefore the least interesting. But Pine injects Kirk with enough personality that he's never dull. Zachary Quinto steals the movie as Spock. He turns what is a one-dimensional character (a rule-abiding nerd) into a fully three-dimensional character. While Kirk may be the ""hero"" of the movie, it's Spock that we really feel for. Qunito ably conveys Spock's internal conflict between his emotionless-Vulcan side, and his human side, which is anything but. Quinto, of ""Heroes"" and ""24"" fame (neither of which I have seen), is an actor to watch. Eric Bana is completely unrecognizable as Nero; he's vicious and a more than worthy adversary to the Enterprise crew, but he's not going to go replace science-fiction's most iconic villain, Darth Vader. Other actors, including Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo, Winona Ryder, dive into their roles just as fully. Leonard Nimoy brings a wise presence in what is much more than glorified cameo.Apart from the time-travel confusion, there are other problems. ""Star Trek"" gets off to a bad start. The problem is that it immediately dives into the story. While there's certainly no crime in getting to the meat of the story quickly, it is essential to have at least some development with the characters. Given the way it turns out, it's not such a big problem here, but even spending a minute or two with the characters would have made it more effective.The second is the lack of character development. Apart from Kirk, Spock, and to an extent, Nero, no one is even remotely fleshed out. But with a cast this big, it's probably unfair to expect more than the film gives. I guess we'll have to wait for future installments to get to know the secondary characters more.Is ""Star Trek"" worth seeing? I liked it. Will the most die-hard fans like it? Not being one myself, I can't say. But I'd say they should give it a shot (if they haven't already). Will it turn me into a Trekkie? Doubtful; I'm not running to Best Buy to buy every season of every show, though I might watch it when it's on TV. Best of all, it's a much needed antidote to the superhero movies, which I have long since tired of.Note: I saw this at 10:15 on the second day of its release. The theater was dark, but from what I could see, there didn't appear to be anyone dressed up as one of the characters. Make of that what you will.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nowhere Near the Old Star Trek... But It's Good.,"I really thought this one would suck. I'm a fan of the Star Trek series, and when I heard it was a prequel, I thought it was a terrible idea. When I heard it was a reboot, I didn't like the idea of just eliminating the universe I liked. I also read some of the negative reviews by other Star Trek fans and wasn't encouraged. But, it really is good and I would be lying if I said I hated it. It was actually very well made.No. It's not on the same plane as the other Star Treks. This one, is popcorn fun action sci-fi. The other series are concept and character driven thought-provoking morality plays and dramas (With some exceptions. There is a lot of God awful old Star Trek floating about too. {Season 3 of TOS, Star trek V, and Season 2 of Enterprise come to mind})But if you accept this as entertainment, and you don't get stuck in the rigid dogma of Gene's assumed vision (Trekkies), or the preconceived notion that Star Trek is for nerds (jocks) you will find a very entertaining summer blockbuster.STRENGTHS - The action is great. The effects are mostly incredible. The actors (with the exception of Chekov {But he's not that bad}) really nail the essence of the characters. The dialogue is good. The pacing is a little fast, but it's meant to be fast, and it keeps you engaged.WEAKNESSES - 2 very obvious ad placements. Strongly emotional events are happening, but the story moves too fast to focus on them. Sulu becomes a little bit of a stereotype. There are some illogical plot elements. And actually (I love the original Star Trek timeline but...) I would've preferred more separation from the original universe. SAlso some of the Enterprise sets look more like a treatment plant than a starship.However, overall, this is really good. It's not the same as the original Star Trek series', but that doesn't make it bad. I would've preferred that they stuck with the old timeline, but really, they didn't know what to do with it, and neither did anyone else, so they took the only logical course. A well-made reboot to appeal to a general audience.This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone (not just the hard-core fans), but anyone who wants to see a good action film.8/10. Good action film.

The future begins.,"The film explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens to destroy the United Federation of Planets.Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Trekkie (is that how you spell it?) in any way nor have I seen a single second of the Star Trek universe in my entire life. In fact, I never really wanted to watch the films in the first place because they never interested me. However, since the fantastic J.J. Abrams was on board, I knew I should see this film. To my relief, the film was great. In fact, it's the best movie I've seen this year thus far!If you find yourself almost teary in the first few minutes of this film, you know it'll be good. The film is character driven. There's a lot of action sequences, yes, but the film is really character driven. In fact, the high point of the film was its characters and the casting made it possible. From a glance, Chris Pine doesn't seem like the ""right"" person to be in the movie. After all, he doesn't have a good track record for the movies he has starred in so far. However, he really does a great job playing the charismatic, smart talk guy. Zachary Quinto does an equally exceptional job as Spock, a name I've heard so many times without knowing who he really was. Eric Bana plays an almost unrecognizable performance as the ""villain."" Simon Pegg and Karl Urban play the comedic relief characters. And to wrap the diverse ensemble up, Zoe Saldana, Ben Cross, John Cho, and Winona Ryder give us each a unique performance.Apart from the cast, the action sequences were amazing, along with the special effects. The score by the underrated Michael Giacchino is great, especially hearing the theme song for the first time. However, the story is also really great. I didn't realize this was a time movie at first. I found it mentally stimulating. The laid back feel and the slapstick humor adds to the immense satisfaction when the credits roll.The film is really good because there's almost nothing bad to say about it. Yes, maybe you can find one small detail here and there that doesn't make the film perfect, but no movies are perfect. This movie is human, with sharp dialogue, and fantastic characters, a complex story, with action sequences to fill on top. If you haven't seen a summer movie yet, make this your first one. As you can see, the film is very accessible for non-Trekkies. However, I'm sure the die-hard Trekkies will appreciate the new, fresh zest Abrams have brought into the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How can Chekov be there?,"Although the movie is not out yet, there is one point of contention in the casting/crew. Pavel Chekov did not appear until the second season of the original series as a ""green"" recruit. He was never a character in the first season. Right away that made his appearance here seem out of place. Indeed, according to the archives on www.startrek.com, Pavel Chekov graduated (graduates?) from the Academy in the year 2267. Jim Kirk graduated in 2254, a full 13 years earlier. If we assume that they graduated as college age students (early 20's or so), that would have made Chekov about 12 when Kirk graduated. Indeed, the same archive puts Kirk's birth year as 2233 so he was indeed 21 upon graduation and Chekov's birth year was listed as 2245 so he was 22 upon graduation. In the original series, Kirk was in his mid 30's as Captain so that would have made a new recruit Chekov in his early 20's so that works out. However, in the new movie, Kirk and Chekov appear to be working side by side right out of the Academy. I think Mr. Abrams made a goof by including Chekov in this original crew movie. This may sound over the top goofy but we are dealing with an old, well established franchise that has certain norms and constants that should be acknowledged. Putting Chekov in this movie appears to be an error. However, as I said, the movie has not even hit the screens yet so there could be some odd explanation (distant cousin, father, etc. Pavel Chekov is listed as an only child so it's not some kind of twin brother thing) but it will still strike the Trek faithful as odd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dammit Jim!,"Greetings again from the darkness. Full disclosure: I am not a Trekie and I have a personal rule - any film with Bruce Greenwood sucks. So imagine my pleasant surprise when I actually enjoyed JJ Abrams newest reincarnation of the franchise AND Mr. Greenwood plays a pivotal role! No doubt serious Star Trek fans will be disappointed in the content. Sci-fi details play a minuscule role in this wide-eyed, special effects feast. This film is closer to being ""Spider-man"" than it is to being a science fiction lesson. As a matter of fact, the black hole creations are a bit humorous to even a science dope like me. Still for two hours you can't take your eyes off the screen ... except when the idiot behind you keeps kicking your seat.Casting is stellar and really helps the film work. Chris Pine (so excellent in Bottle Shock as the goofy son) and Zachary Quinto (Heroes) are terrific as Jim Kirk and Spock, the early years. We see the early head-butting and foundation for the friendship. An unrecognizable Eric Bana plays bad guy Nero and Karl Urban is very good as the serious Bones McCoy. Beautiful Zoe Saldana seems to overact a bit as Uhura and Simon Pegg livens up the film, even though he seems misplaced, as Scotty.Don't miss Winona Ryder as Spock's mom, Jennifer Morrison (House) as Kirk's mom in intergalactic labor and ultra-rich Tyler Perry as the Admiral in charge of the hearing for a cheating Jim Kirk. All nice touches by TV guru, Abrams. Still, by far the most fun, is Leonard Nimoy's time on screen. He brings a majestic presence and a touch of class and history to his role. Very cool.Music is fine, but you have to wait for the end credits to hear the original theme song (written by creator Gene Roddenberry).

A Solid Prequel,"The eagerly anticipated reboot of the the Star Trek series finally has arrived with (technically the 11th film in the series) the self titled Star Trek by the popular new action/drama wunderkind JJ Abrams at the helm. In full disclosure I need to point out that I have been a huge Star Trek fan (mainly Next Generation) for a long time. When I heard they wanted to give a much needed jump start to the franchise by making a prequel, I was skeptical. I mean, c'mon, do we really need to see a movie of Kirk and Spock Go to Starfleet. But, for all intent and purpose, JJ Abrams has done a pretty good job of making a younger, slicker and action packed Star Trek that introduces us to the beloved characters that have been satirized and joked about for decades.The film straddles the two worlds of hardcore Trekkies and non Trekkies alike by exploring the origins of the two main characters...James Tiberius Kirk and a half human/half Vulcan named Spock. Unbeknown to them, they share a common bond of family tragedy in their lives. We meet them both as precocious children in their own right. The rebellious Kirk and the ever logical Spock. But, what I liked is they give Spock more freedom of expression than what we would see in the original series and the subsequent first 6 films. Mercifully, we are quickly taken through their days of Star Fleet and how they came to join the Academy. Their paths of getting there were similar in its guise and it is here that we also are introduced to Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy who quickly befriends Kirk. All this while, the evil Captain Nero of the enemy Romulans is wrecking havoc on the galaxy and it is up to our young and inexperienced heroes traveling in the newly christened Enterprise to save the day, which you know they will...it's Star Trek.Before I get into what is good about the film let me say what I didn't like about it. Aside from the usual predictability and necessary suspension of disbelief. I was not at all interested in the evil Romulan threat, it wasn't interesting enough. And of course, in Star Trek world, when in doubt throw in a time travel plot line. I also felt JJ rushed through the introductions of the characters and giving some of them like McCoy cute dialogue that is representative of how we have come to know these characters in the past. The climax was also quick and clean, without any real suspense. I'll get into the acting soon enough. What I liked about the film was the special effects were fantastic, seeing Leonard Nimoy again as Spock. He certainly still remembers the characterization very well. Trekkies will love bringing in Captain Pike but he seemed to be an afterthought once we are settled on to the Enterprise As for the acting. First of all, before I get slammed with angry messages, let me just say that Star Trek is not a story that demands stellar acting. However, as an actor, good work is demanded of you at all times to make the story truthful. Chris Pine who portrays the iconic James T Kirk grows on you. He embody's the characteristics we know about Kirk, a horny, rebel who plays by his own rules. But, except for one occasion he made Kirk his own with no trace of William Shatner and I applaud him for that. Zachary Quinto (Sylar from Heroes) brought emotional depth underneath all that logic and I thought he was the best of them all. The great Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead himself) was pretty funny as Scotty and I welcomed his comic relief. As for Karl Urban as McCoy. He was highly irritating. He essentially mimicked DeForest Kelley's work as McCoy and although you hear imitation is the finest form of flattery, it's not in this case. Create your own character. Same goes for Anton Yelchin as Chekov, he just mimicked. Walter Koenig. Some found it cute. I didn't. John Cho did a decent job as Sulu, we certainly see a new side of him. Zoe Saldana as Uhura also decided to create her own character and even though she is essentially filler, she made the most of her scenes. There is an interesting twist to her love life from the original series that's for sure. Finally, Eric Bana as Captain Nero was boring and completely devoid of interest for me. He was indicating badly to the point of annoyance. Great Star Trek villains like Ricardo Montelban as Khan, Christopher Plummer as General Chang and Alice Krige as the Borg Queen all made me feel something about who they are and the reasons why they did what they did. I hope JJ takes note of that in the next one.Overall, Star Trek is entertaining with all it's faults (there are gaps in the writing). I would rate it the 4th best in the film series. It's not a great film but it exceeded my expectations. As far as prequels go, this was one of the better ones I've seen. Yes, it's is even better than Star Wars Episode 1. However, I would recommend in the sequel that JJ take his time and not rush through sequences and make the villains have more depth. I give Star Trek 3 stars and is out now in a theater near you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surpasses my expectations in every way!,"As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for Star Trek (the one that showed a person working on the Enterprise) I knew it would be special. Abrams knocked my socks off with Cloverfield, and Star Trek is even better.I will not give away one detail, but the movie held me from the beginning to end.Each cast member pulls their weight, I thought the Chris Pine and Zach Quinto especially deserve props. I would think that the casting of the new Kirk and Spock would be hardest to pull off, and they are AMAZING!!! I am a fan of the older movies, and this is definitely up there with ""Wrath of Kahn,"" if not better.Worth your money and then some!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Live long and prosper...,"Abrams and crew went above and beyond my expectations and completely blew me away with fascinating visual effects, top notch music and high grade acting. Just like what Nolan did to Batman, JJ Abrams breathed new life to a dormant franchise and one can assume that this is where things will kickstart for Captain Kirk and his Enterprise crew. Having seen this one, I am all for a Star Trek 12 and I might even buy the classic series and the preceding movies. JJ Abrams, also the director of underrated action piece Mission Impossible 3, definitely has an eye for action and escapist storytelling and this movie might just be his hot ticket to greater movie projects.I've had my reservations with Chris Pine playing Kirk because to be honest, no one really knew him and the fans were worried if the new Captain Kirk will work or not. Well, fortunately all is good and well with Chris Pine as he fills in the shoes of William Shatner. Pine's approach to Kirk brings justice to Shatner's unique portrayal while making a distinct personality that caters the new generation. Not to be outdone, Zachary Quinto of Heroes fame brings the assertiveness and gusto of Spock to a whole new level. Both of them meld perfectly on screen and the chemistry has a certain spark and charm that will be remembered by fans and non-fans alike. Tip of the hat also to Karl Urban who plays Bones McCoy, Simon Pegg as disgraced engineer Scotty, Zoe Saldana as feisty Uhura and a kickass John Cho as Enterprise pilot Hikari Sulu. Eric Bana channels some of his ""Chopper characteristics playing main baddie, Nero and for all intents and purposes, his turn as a villain was effective and three dimensional.Mind blowing visual effects and an ear piercing and stunning score by Michael Giacchino bookends this visual treat of a movie that is turning to be an early 2009 favorite among fans and critics.

As good an action film as you will see,"For the most part, negative reviews of this film come from fans of the original TV series who are disappointed about the remake's ""unfaithfulness"" to Gene Roddenberry's universe. I have read reviews, for instance, disparaging the new film's intellectual inadequacies, or its lack of a tidy, coherent moral message--to loyal fans, these were an integral part of what made ""Trek"" so fascinating and ahead of its time.But in enumerating the myriad ways that the new Trek differs from the old, the die-hards are completely missing the point. They are simply reinforcing what has been made explicitly clear: this is not Roddenberry's Star Trek, but J.J. Abram's.And when we judge Abram's Trek on its own merits, it is quite difficult to dislike. This Trek is able to transmit much of the wonder and excitement of the original, while excelling in aspects where the older series lagged. One such aspect, of course, is special effects--even most Trekkies will be excited that their beloved Enterprise now has an arsenal truly fit for the 23rd century.Regardless of its detractors, the film isn't pure muscle and action--the young actors excel in their challenging roles, and the writing is sharp, witty, and, yes, intelligent! The end result is a Star Trek re-make much like (I would suggest) a Lord of the Rings re-make: a quality film which stakes out new territory, but which is able to harness the compelling uniqueness of the original universe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek Gets A 21st Century Facelift!,"Freeing itself from the baggage of the previous instalments by setting its plot in an alternate timeline, thus preserving the contents of the original series without entirely depending on it, Star Trek is the reboot of the highly popular franchise of the same name that attempts to resurrect its vast universe from the ground up for a new generation of viewers but it has a lot in store for the old Trekkies as well.Taking place in an alternate reality from the original series, the story of Star Trek follows the early years of James T. Kirk & Spock, covering their time in Starfleet which is soon followed by them travelling aboard the USS Enterprise to go against Captain Nero; a Romulan from the future who has traversed back in time and is hellbent on destroying the Vulcan planet to avenge the destruction of his own home which takes place in the near future.Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Trek presents a much revamped look & post-modern feel and is crafted in a manner that makes its mythology more appealing & accessible to newcomers without alienating the devoted fans of the original series. The plot unfolds at a vibrant pace thanks to Abrams' kinetic direction and although the screenplay does feature an interesting story, it never really ups the ante & stays at the same level from start to finish.Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in putting up some truly impressive sets on the screen. Cinematography makes extensive use of its colour palette while the dynamic camera-work carries a momentum of its own. Its 127 minutes of runtime is rarely felt, visual effects & make-up are undeniably state-of-the-art stuff, and Michael Giacchino earns a high score for chipping in with a soundtrack that simply fits.The cast comprises of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Eric Bana, Leonard Nimoy, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg & others, and although everyone fails to make a lasting impression, none of them can be considered a disappointment either. Pine & Quinto are quite believable as Kirk & Spock, respectively, and their developing chemistry only works out in the film's favour. Also, Nimoy delivers a shot of nostalgia by reprising the role of original Spock from the original series.On an overall scale, Star Trek manages to get most things right than wrong and yet, I don't feel much love for it as, just like Star Wars, this series never interested me in the first place. The technical brilliance of this reboot cannot be denied but its main story packs in nothing that's captivating enough to change my mind. An eye-popping production that features an engaging story but lacks escalation, Star Trek is a 21st century makeover of a classic franchise for 21st century filmgoers. Worth a shot for sure.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"Saw this last night. Went in pretty skeptical. It's been a long, long time since I've been excited about a Star Trek movie. But wow, this was a great piece of entertainment! It was suspenseful, awe-inspiring, clever, and funny all at the same time...and overall just a joy to watch. ""Fun"" is probably the best word to describe it. It was like spending time with some old friends and being reminded of what you loved about them in the first place. Plus, it illuminates a chapter of Star Trek lore that we've never seen and never really heard much about. There were no cringe-worthy moments, and I'd really struggle to find anything negative to say about this movie.As far as the performances, the standouts to me were Anton Yelchin as Chekov (had the accent down perfectly), Karl Urban as McCoy (really worked hard to pay homage to DeForest Kelly's version), and Zoe Saldana (I never realized Uhura was hot...did you?) Simon Pegg's Scotty was hilarious and shows up at the perfect time in the story. He just nailed it. I look forward to seeing more of him in the inevitable sequels.Chris Pine makes a great debut here and includes extremely subtle Shatner-isms in his performance. From his chest-puffed walk, to little, barely discernible facial expressions and eye movements will remind you of Shatner from time to time, without the stilted delivery of a cliché Jim Carrey-style impersonation, thank God. He makes a great young Kirk who you can easily imagine growing into the Captain we know from the original series and especially the later movies.Zachary Quinto probably had the hardest job in this movie, considering his classic counterpart (Leonard Nimoy) is actually in the film for real-time comparison. I've never seen Heroes, so I wasn't sure what to expect from him, but I thought he did a pretty good job considering the challenges of the role. He didn't remind me of Leonard Nimoy at all, but I could see him fit as a younger, slightly more emotional Spock than we've ever seen on screen. Let's face it, those are big shoes to fill, especially when he's in the movie.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised and had a great night at the movies. I'd recommend this to any former fan who has since given up on Star Trek. It's a whole new experience of the franchise. And for those who have never been a fan, but know all the pop-culture references of all the characters...I think those are the people who are really going to love it. Highly recommended for anyone and everyone really.I'll definitely be seeing this again this weekend.Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A bold and immensely satisfying adventure,"When I walked into the theater, I barely knew anything about Star Trek. My knowledge consisted of a few character names and other tidbits I had picked up, mostly from reviews of this very movie. However, luckily for me, while there are probably some in-jokes and subtleties that I missed, it did not matter. My ignorance of Trekkie-lore did not hinder my enjoyment of an expertly-made and thoroughly entertaining movie. While I would not say that J.J. Abram's Star Trek is quite on par with The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins, which were both movies that successfully rebooted a failing franchise just like Star Trek, I agree with what many critics and audience members have been saying since the sci-fi movie first hit theaters: it is phenomenal for the way it managed to please fans of the original series while still welcoming newbies like me.One of the first things worth noting is the stellar ensemble cast. While no single performance stands out, though both Chris Pine as James T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock come rather close, every cast member gets a moment to shine and they all take advantage of that opportunity. Though they are relatively new to the movie industry, Pine and Quinto do a brilliant job as the two main characters and their relationship, which changes from one of mutual hate to something more amiable, develops extremely well, largely due to their unique chemistry. As the villain, Eric Bana brings just the right amount of menace and, strangely, humanity, allowing the audience to sympathize with his cause without compromising the evil nature of his character. Other performances that deserve mention are Karl Urban as Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy, John Cho as Mr. Sulu, Simon Pegg as the quirky but intelligent Scotty and Anton Yelchin as a very Russian Chekov. Zoe Saldana does a fine job as Uhura but her character lacks the development and distinctive personality of the others as, though some comes through occasionally, she turns into little more than a love interest.Other than the fantastic cast, an infinite amount of credit for the movie's success should go to director J.J. Abrams. As a fan of Lost, I was ecstatic when I heard the praise reviewers were giving Abrams, and after seeing the movie, I completely concur with everything people have said about him. Given the amount of effort put into the film, it's surprising that he was, in fact, not originally a fan of Star Trek, yet that actually seems to be more of a good thing because he approached the movie as a newcomer, enabling him to tell the story without getting bogged down in the mythology as a die-hard fan might have done. Of course, he could only achieve all of this with the help of producer Damon Lindelof and writers Roborto Orzi and Alex Kurtzman, all of whom also worked with him on Lost. They all did a great job of developing the characters and combining action, romance, drama and science fiction into a credible, gripping story. The dialogue was clever, often funny, and occasionally cheesy, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, there is enough emotion to make the audience - even non-Trekkies - care about the characters, many of whom are not even human, but it never becomes sappy or overly melodramatic.Last come the techs. The cinematography was very good and the visual effects, while nothing groundbreaking, were nonetheless quite spectacular. Fortunately, unlike many modern blockbusters, Star Trek does not fall into the trap of relying on special effects or action; in fact, the action is always secondary to the characters and story. The score by Michael Giacchino finds the right chord between heroically uplifting and urgent. It never distracts from the movie itself, instead emphasizing the tone or emotion of a particular scene and lending the film an almost epic feel.Initially, I was conflicted between seeing this or Terminator Salvation, which just came out, in theaters. A combination of impressively good reviews and word-of-mouth, the enticing trailer, a promising looking cast and, of course, J.J. Abrams convinced me to see Star Trek, and I in no way regret my choice. While I have not been converted to a hardcore Trekkie, nor do I think I ever will, I will certainly be interested in any sequels that come out in the future. May this franchise and the careers of all those involved live long and prosper.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek Redux Exhilerates,"Continuing the trend of reinventing sixties iconic figures such as Batman and James Bond, Star Trek was inevitably next in line. For those who fretted that the new incarnation of creator Gene Roddenberry's beloved franchise of 'Wagon Train to the Stars' would be dishonored or ignored, they needn't worry. This new version, intended to reboot the franchise that was so popular in TV reruns and subsequently in a series of big budget films, is a remarkably balanced take on the origins of the classic Enterprise crew. It is designed to appeal to the non-initiated audience while referencing the existing canon of Star Trek lore. Director J. J. Abrams (Fringe, Alias, Mission Impossible III) brings a fresh vision abetted by Trekkie fan/writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.James T. Kirk is born as his father rescues a starship crew during a Romulan attack led by the mysterious Nero (Eric Bana). A young rebel who grows into a brash, thrill seeking adventurer, young Kirk (Chris Pine) is recruited into Star Fleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Meanwhile the half Vulcan / half human Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has matured amid bullying kids and decides his destiny lies with The Federation as a cadet instead of his home planet Vulcan. Kirk strikes up a friendship with an ornery young Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban is a hoot) whose distrust of space and things not medical will become legendary. It is McCoy who devises a way for Kirk to become a crew member of the newly commissioned starship Enterprise. In fact, most of what will become the core crew is assembled including communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsmen Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and later, engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg). Seeking vengeance against the Federation, Nero has traveled through time to exact pain and destruction with a planet killing device that will draw the Enterprise to Vulcan and ultimately Earth. With the Universe in the balance, Kirk and Spock must decide if they can work together (with the help of a certain mentor).The parallel life paths of Kirk and Spock are marked contrasts of two men who will clash and reconcile their future relationship. Kirk smacks of hawkish, shoot-from-the-hip reactionary while Spock is the logical, think-inside-the-box good soldier. Nero reminds us a bit of Khan from Wrath of Khan. The character of Uhura is a major upgrade. She is a multi-talented officer who has romantic longings for a certain Vulcan. Greenwood shines as the veteran Pike. Leonard Nimoy makes a welcome, pivotal appearance as an elder Spock who figures prominently in the history that is to come. The cast makes the most of iconic roles and excels at recreating the personas of what we remember; each crew member gets an opportunity to shine. It is nice to see this group working and improvising together for the first time to solve a crisis. Further, this story takes it for granted as does its audience that this crew is not only multicultural, but multi-species, a far cry from the novelty of the integrated crew of classic Trek.The screenplay has some well written dialogue and clever Trek references sprinkled throughout, and age old lines of the classic show are introduced for the first time. When McCoy utters, ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist"", it's a riot. Part of the fun is watching two heavyweights like Kirk and Spock faceoff and slowly bond and seeing how Kirk ascends to the captain's chair. We finally get to learn what the 'Kobayashi Maru' wargame really is and how Kirk manages to defeat the test.Sure, the plot has some gaping holes if you think about continuity and the fate of a certain venerable, classic character. Nero's motives are explained in time, but they don't make total sense. This film also does not have the gravitas of deep themes as previous films which is perhaps its only true failing, but instead, we get a strong character study that more than compensates.Technical effects are quite impressive although Abrams seems to favor close-ups and tight camera setups that put the viewer in the middle of action scenes. Fortunately, there are no jarring Cloverfield hand-held camera moves. There is a good fight sequence on a weapons platform and a surprise on an ice planet. You want phasers shooting back and forth in space battle? You've got them here. In fact the energy level keeps this voyage bouncing along.The Enterprise is stunning-it has never looked quite this way ever, and it is cool how they depict the starship going into warp drive. There are imaginative points of view when showing off the ship's exterior, and the interior is brimming with activity and sound, which is in stark contrast to the more antiseptic views from the earlier show. The costumes (complete with female miniskirts) harken back to that period and yet seem fresh. At credits' end, there is a nice dedication to the Roddenberrys, Gene and Majel Barrett (who voices the Federation computer one last time).Fans of the old show may tear up at how faithful and creative Abrams and his screenwriters are with Trek lore and how they set everything up nicely going forward. This is their alternate universe now, and we are game for the experience. This crew, baptized under fire, is ready for new missions, and they cannot come soon enough. Way to go, Mr. Abrams.

"Prequel to TOS, 21st Century Style","Any movie fan knows that the key elements to a good movie are (not in order) story line, direction, cinematography, acting, and soundtrack. There are many good films that may be weak in one or two of these areas. However, a great movie excels in all of these areas. Star Trek 2009 is one such film. You most certainly do not need to be a ""Trekkie"" to enjoy the movie, for it stands on its own as terrific sci-fi. However, fans of Star Trek TOS (the original series) will be even more enamored of this near-perfect production, because the young characters (Kirk, Spock and cast) are true to their adult persona, as developed for television. At least, it's what we suspect these memorable characters would have been like in their youth. The inter-play, dialogue, and even the comic relief, is pure entertainment, and you will not find yourself looking at your watch at any point in the film. Casting is spot-on, as is the script. I have no doubt that this movie could not have been done any better, even if Gene Roddenberry had overseen production himself. I suggest, if you have the opportunity, that you see it in IMAX, because the computer generated graphics and sets are truly spectacular, such that the imagery nearly jumps off the screen and you actually find yourself on ""the final frontier."" FYI: Roddenberry developed his idea for Star Trek in 1964 when he thought of combining Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. The show was eventually canceled because of low ratings. However, the show's impact on pop culture cannot be denied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Warping Good Time,"The past is never dead. It's not even past.William Faulkner's famous words take on new life in this 2009 take on the classic 1960s sci-fi series, not so much a remake or reboot as a re-invigoration. People who grew up loving ""Star Trek,"" particularly what is known to Trek fans as ""The Original Series,"" may gulp at some of the liberties taken with familiar characters as Spock, Kirk, and Uhura, but they certainly will find much to surprise them, delight them (if they are open-minded enough going in) and certainly rekindle passions that connect with their inner child. Time warping, indeed.In that light, the movie's plot seems quite appropriate. In the 23rd century, a band of tricked-out Romulans angry at the destruction of their planet travel back in time to avenge themselves on the Federation, whom they blame for their loss. Their actions alter what generations of fans have come to know as the Star Trek universe, to the point where the past is indeed not even the past.Young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself not captain of the U. S. S. Enterprise but a brig-bound renegade, one harboring understandable antipathy for a half-human, half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto) who is Enterprise's rigid commander and seems to harbor a decided dislike for the young Iowa hotshot. How much dislike? He maroons the poor kid on an ice planet for starters.As one character tells Kirk in the film's second half: ""Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed."" Translation for hard-core Trekkers: Just relax and try to enjoy the show. Nothing's broken that breaking out the old series DVDs won't fix.The clever concept embedded in Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman's script means the movie can work in all the references it wants to the series while changing things up in high style, celebrating what was great about the show and has lasted in our collective memory without laboring under too much backstory. Director J. J. Abrams facilitates this approach by emphasizing the human connections developed with the original Star Trek characters, as well as welcome shafts of humor that cut through the rousing action sequences and gee-whiz special effects.Given all this, the movie only works as well as it does because of the sterling job done by the movie's principals, particularly the two leads. Quinto carves out some dark and original territory as Spock, understandable given the situation the film's plot puts him in, yet he also connects with Leonard Nimoy's defining interpretation of Spock from TV, both literally and figuratively. Quinto's the film's strongest asset.Pine doesn't try to mimic his TV model, William Shatner, so much as present the same kind of wit and cocksure energy in a younger, less refined package, which comes off terrifically and connects with Abrams' tongue-in-cheek reverence for the material. Spock and Kirk take a long time to develop any kind of chemistry, but when they do, it's worth the wait.I don't think ""Star Trek"" is all that great as a straight adventure movie. The central plot about the time-traveling Romulans flying around in their giant metal moth gets old fast. Visually, Abrams likes using flares way too much, and our patience is tested with too much exposition. I didn't care for Simon Pegg's comically broad interpretation of Enterprise engineer Montgomery Scott, while John Cho's Mr. Sulu is a bit dull (though perhaps because he's written too much that way.) The rest of the actors playing the movie's familiar characters really bring it, from Zoe Saldana's tough but emotional take on Uhura to Anton Yelchin's amusingly gonzo turn as Ensign Chekhov. Real fans may be surprised to see the easy gravitas Bruce Greenwood brings as a secondary series character, Captain Pike, who starts the movie as Enterprise's commander.That's not all that will surprise them, of course, which is as it should be. ""Star Trek"" will be best appreciated by those with a healthy interest in the franchise going in, but it can be enjoyed by most non-Trek fans to a degree none of those earlier movies could, ironic considering how much more this film consciously hearkens back to the TV show than the earlier movies did (even, especially, those that featured the actors from the original series, which always seemed to try too hard at wholesale reinvention.)The end result: A nice time-warp of an adventure film that gives the lie to a line by another famous writer: ""You can never go home again.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just Watch It,"This was the easiest 9 out of 10 I've ever given. Star Trek is the Star Trek movie we've been waiting for, despite it's negation of almost all previous Trek (not a spoiler, by the way). Part of the reason I don't give it a 10 is because of that weird negation which leaves us with Enterprise as the only Trek relevant to this new series (I hope we get some sequels out of this!). The new timeline leaves us with the same characters who are somehow different. Everything is familiar but different enough that we don't know what to expect. So this movie feels very much like a reboot as well as a continuation, and a sequel as well as a prequel in a way only Star Trek can. You will feel uneasy about this a few times in the movie, when you realize that there is no reset button, and no way to cheat death. The Kobiashi Maru figures into the story, and you'll see why when you watch. By the way, without spoiling too much, Spock, Vulcan or not, copes with loss remarkably well.Venturing into the unknown, coping with loss, and a fair amount of logic vs. humanity make this a more mature movie than perhaps the producers want you to think it is (the commercials seem to advertise it as purely an action flick). But watching it reminded me of the best parts of Star Trek II and VI, my favorite Trek films. In fact, as much action as there is here, it never seems to drag too long or seem incomprehensible as it does in most action movies. The focus is on the story and the characters.And the characterizations are solid, if a bit different from what we expect. Sulu doesn't have his cocky optimism and machismo despite being respectably kick-ass. Cho seems to be channeling his masochist character from House rather than the reborn Harold from the end of Harold and Kumar. Uhura, still the most compassionate character, is withdrawn and a bit cold compared to Nichelle's warm and playful Uhura who sings and shakes her booty when off duty. Bones is spot-on, and Zachary Quinto, who already seems to have the name of a Vulcan, is also superb. Chris Pine has clearly done his homework here and channels Kirk far better than Jim Carrey ever did on In Living Color. There is one scene towards the very end of the movie, as he walks onto the bridge where Pine seems to have copied cell-for-cell a signature Shatner mannerism. I'll have to watch it again to be more specific.One last note. Not terribly pertinent but something I have to get out. The Vulcan school where we see young Spock seemed just a bit too robotic and alien for a Vulcan institution. This is a culture of logic, yes, but also a culture of jeweled breastplates and Hebrew hand signals. Eh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maybe....,"I went and saw this movie with great expectations, and I wasn't completely disappointed. But I felt that somehow the movie was made with a general vision of transforming the franchise to a more contemporary and not so geeky setting. Which has been done. The problem is that it's not enough. You need to have a good, engaging story that makes sense and characters that you really care about and that also fits the vision.Instead we here have a story that could have been an episode on TNG and characters that would fit in a Steven Seagal movie.The movie survives thanks to tempo and excellent CGI.

The Original is Still the Best!,"Firstly, the look of Star Trek is every bit as awesome (and more) as I could have expected – both the interior and exterior scenes are breathtaking. The look of the film helps build the bridge between our time and the 23rd Century deep rooting some fundamental likenesses, making the viewer feel more at home (which is a clever tool). Likewise is the re-vamped world of Star Fleet; the ships, the uniforms – all scenes showing suitable respect for the original without looking dated and merging perfectly with new and shinier glimpse of the future. The Enterprise is given a massive boost in scale, showing enormous shuttle bays, an engine room the size of a football pitch and bustling corridors of furious activity. Even the bad guys, namely the Romulans have had a re-branding and now look every bit the menacing, xenophobic warrior race they were always made out to be. This is before we get into the special effects and CGI which is absolutely flawless in every respect.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are great respectively as Kirk and Spock, bringing new and edgy depth to probably the most well known science fiction characters ever created and really getting the best out of them, which is no easy task. The on-screen chemistry between the two works really well as you get a real feel for the characters deep bond and friendship for each other which was so well documented in Treks gone by. A favourable nod also to Karl Urban who plays Dr. Bones McCoy, taking real inspiration from DeForest Kelly's characterisation and manages to capture the essence of the character without running the risk of mimicking too much or making the performance cheesy. Also impressive is John Cho as Sulu who gets a real opportunity to shine and gets in on some of the action sequences, again bringing a freshness to the to the role and creating his own interpretation of the Enterprise helmsman without relaying too much on the original character. Zoe Saldana who plays the new Ohura brings some sex appeal and sass to the bridge of the Enterprise, but has little to do except be intergalactic eye candy. Then onto Anton Yelchin as Chekov who despite a lively performance is turned into little more than an annoying parody of the original ('Kiptin, therrre isa wessel apprrroaccchhhing' – you get the idea!) . the real losers in all of this are Simon Pegg and Eric Bana; Pegg gets relegated to the final third of the movie as Chief Engineer Scotty and despite being funny and charming never quite gets the opportunity to cement himself as more than just the comedy relief and Bana's performance is not going to get him into the history books as Trek's most fearsome baddie.So that was the style, unfortunately the substance leaves a lot to be desired. The plot is a flimsy and lazy recycling of stuff we have seen umpteen times before, the story to is clumsy, putting all of it's faith into a clunky time travel scenario which has some major, major holes (black holes if you will!) which undermines the whole thing enough to leave it constantly playing catch up with itself. To the more experienced Trekkie and movie goer this comes across as nothing more than a blatant attempt to re-write the Trek universe and make it more malleable for future outings, without the writers having to be too beholding to what has come before. You can see the Vulcan logic in that, but sadly it comes across as little more than a big intergalactic middle finger and slap in the face to those that hold the trek universe dear to them.It showed me what I have suspected for a very long time; JJ Abrams is a brilliant visionary, however he lacks the story telling skills necessary to compliment his brilliant ideas. He has gone on record and stated that he was not a fan of Star Trek before he became involved in the film and if I am absolutely honest, that shows in abundance. Star Trek is a franchise that has its own universe and 40 years of history to draw on, but like every universe it has its own rules and heritage. This film does not have that feel and as a result of this Abrams and the writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have dropped a clanger, making it feel just a little bit cheap and shallow, lacking the depth and true exploration of the human condition which classic Trek is famous for. If the re-vamped Star Trek is going to be a long running franchise, I would advise all involved to take a leaf out of the books of Bryan Singer's 'X-Men', Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and Zach Snyder's brilliant 'Watchmen', which have all been treated with shameless love and affection which shines through.Despite the poor plot and story and that it runs dangerously close to cheesy in places, the film just about makes amends by keeping up an energetic pace, mixing the action and slower scenes well; there are also some very clever references back to the original series and movies, which is a bit of a treat for the Trekkies to pick out. As I mentioned before, there is just about enough here to like despite its very big flaws and if they can iron out the bugs I am keen to see what the inevitable sequels will hold. For the new generation of Trek newbie's (who I'm sure won't give a damn about my bleating on about plot, storyline and Trek heritage) I have no doubt that Star Trek will be the blockbuster of the year and encourage just as loyal a following as the originals. For me though its shortcomings sadly took enough gloss off for me to think it as nothing more than just above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Name is James Tiberius Kirk,"I just came back from a very advanced screening here in the U.K. and man was I blown away, now let set a few things straight right away, I am not a star trek fan, honestly before today had very little idea of what the whole deal was and the only line I really knew was ""Beam me up, Scotty"" (they don't use this line in the film), The film starts as I was explained by a very enthusiastic Trekkie, in the beginning before the whole star trek universe had started, so I guess thats a good thing for someone not very attune with the whole concept. Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine were both amazing as Spock and Kirk. I thought Pine did a really good job as Kirk but since I don't know what Shatner was like, I cant really comment if he was better. Now one good thing JJ Abrams has done is that he has put up a lot of comedy in the film, thus even though its supposed to be serious stuff going on the comedic edge keeps things fun. Simon Pegg as Scott was brilliant. This review wont be complete without mentioning the top notch CGI, the graphics were amazing, they made the whole affair a pleasant feast for the eyes. Now I have heard that a lot of die hard Trekkie's don't like this film on some grounds, I don't really know what they are but I felt that is a must watch after an amazing Wolverine this just puts more fun in this years whole summer movie showdown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Welcome back Star Trek,"Basically, Star Trek For Dummies, but an entertaining kick-ass movie from start to finish none the less. The sound and visuals are top notch. The cast is great. Some of the actors make their own interpretation of the characters (Kirk, Spock, Uhura) and others do their best to imitate the originals (McCoy, Scotty), but they are all very fun to watch. I wish William Shatner would have said YES to the cameo he was offered. I admire the filmmakers' bold move of rebooting the Star trek time line and restarting it with a clean slate. It was much needed. Welcome back Star Trek, your future looks promising. NOTE: The Star Trek: Countdown prequel comic book is highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beyond the Final Frontier,"It's not clear from the opening moments of J.J. Abrams' Star Trek what we're in for. A dramatic, action-filled opening greets us on a huge scale of special effects, makeup design, elaborate sets, and emoting. From there the film zooms along, introducing us to the characters, jetting off on a thrilling plot, racing us through action, humor, and character in an incredible display of movie magic until we reach the finale and simple ending. Yet somewhere along the way something has changed. Somewhere along the way we've been completely taken in, and Star Trek has emerged as something of a masterpiece.To give away any of the plot would be to take away from what is truly a fantastic experience. I am in no way someone familiar with the original series, and guess what: This movie still blew me away. The feeling of elation filling me as I left the movie theater is a feeling the likes of which has not been produced by a summer action movie in a long time. Director Abrams has taken one of the most popular series of all time and created something current and completely enjoyable for all audiences. What's incredible is that he was able to take a material so beloved and turn it into something far beyond anything you'd ever expect from a Star Trek movie. It truly goes beyond the 'final frontier', and into great movie territory.The cast all fit the movie perfectly, providing humorous characters with just the right amount of humanity to make them completely relatable. The film takes us on a journey that is so out-of-this-earth (excuse the pun), we can't help but drink it up. The movie is paced at a great speed to keep us utterly enthralled and still allow for the appropriate amount of depth. But most importantly of all, the film reminds us what true, wonderful movie-making is all about in the first place: Entertainment. 8.5/10 stars!!!Jay Addison",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek is decent entertainment for all its junk.,"The Star Trek franchise has become a sensation across the globe and now TV Producer J.J Abrams comes out with a prequel to the franchise with modern special effects and modern actors to play the classic parts. A good idea, but Abrams does not really achieve his goal. I was bored more than enthralled by the storytelling. Zachary Quinto is good as Spock, a highlight of the otherwise ineffective reboot. The visuals are good with lots of neat insights on the famous franchise, but Abrams adds a lot of unneeded stylized crudeness and action scenes that do not really attain to the plot. It's not bad, but when you get down to it, only Star Trek junkies will give it the time of day.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maximum warp!,"Star Trek (the reboot) is one of the best 'summer blockbusters' i've seen in years. While most of these 'event' movies seem to disappoint, Star Trek is actually better than you can imagine! This is a really clever and well done reboot of the original series which should please Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike. Some nit-picking purists might moan about certain aspects but this is better than anyone could have hoped.Starting with a blistering pre-credits sequence that is both exciting and moving, you just know your in for a treat! And the rest of the film is just as good, for director JJ Abrams has given us a fresh new take on the Trek universe. He has upped the action quota (and much of it is quite brutal) and the film moves at such a breakneck speed as to be a thrilling ride. Special effects are top notch, and there are some stunning shots that will have you itching to see the film again.Thankfully the most important aspect, the cast, are just superb. Nice performances that hark back to the original characters but don't imitate them. Quinto is just uncanny as Spock and Chris Pine is just dynamite as the young arrogant but self assured Kirk. Some of their scenes with each other are just riveting. Also worthy of note is Karl Urban as McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty, although Pegg does get less screen time than the rest.There are a few flaws in the film, one involving a massive coincidence thats hard to swallow, a silly alien that chases Kirk and an alien assistant for Scotty we could have done without. But these don't detract from what is a hugely entertaining and enjoyable entry into the Star Trek universe.This viewer is already looking forward to seeing it again and hopefully we'll see some sequels. But if your planning to see it, then make sure you see it on the big screen for maximum effect!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good but no where near Great,"JJ Abrahams rebooting of Star Trek works. You have to walk into the theater knowing that what you know about Star Trek is being thrown out the window to some extent! The actors fit their characters. Only Spock seems off. Not the actor but the character. Too emotional. I know he's half human but it was a bit much for such a classic character.The biggest improvement Abrahams made in the film to recent Star trek films is the passing. this movie moves along at a brisk pace. Unlike Nemesis, which I thought was decent, this Star Trek starts off fast and keeps going. Also unlike previous films, which seemed like large budget TV episodes, this is a MOVIE. You can see a big budget on screen. And in this day of good and bad cgi, the big budget makes this picture seem like an event film rather than a niche production of an endearing TV series.The story is paper thin. The villain, I enjoy Eric Banna as an actor, but his villain is nothing special. Okay.What make this movie work is the spirit. It's fun.NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME REVIEWS AND FANS MAKE IT OUT TO BE. But it's still entertaining and fun summer film. You don't need to be a trekkie to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Okay reboot,"This is a decent reboot to one of the most underrated but iconic franchises of all time. Chris Pine does a decent job of playing Captain Kirk - albeit not nearly as charmingly smug as old mate William Shatner. The film tries to reboot the original series and films with a new universe that is mildly thrilling, albeit not as authentically star trek in my opinion. The film along with its subsequent instalments does a better effort in terms of cinematography and special effects, merely a product of the advancement of modern cinema. Otherwise, I find the new films to be cheap thrills in comparison to the original films and series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best of summer so far,"JJ Abrams does what I never would have expected him to do, make a Star Trek that was accessible to everybody, even those who never really thought much of it (namely me for one). This is an eye-popping, heart-racing thriller of a movie with fantastic special effects, make-up, and exhilarating action sequences. It has a fantastic supporting cast including Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, and Eric Bana, being perfectly twisted as the main Romulan villain Nero. Leonard Nimoy also appears in a cameo that should have fans drooling. But what I loved were the two central performances coming from Chris Pine, as the cocky, restless, and wild James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as Spock, torn between logic and emotion, Quinto finds the humanity. The power struggle between the two is one of the highlights of the movie. I can only hope that Abram's ""Star Trek"" will live long and prosper.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A TERRIFIC Summer movie!,"I've always liked Star Trek but never loved it (except on a few occasions: ST I, Wrath Of Khan & the ""save the whales"" movie). People who speak Klingon creep me out.I gotta say that this new Trek was a blast!This re-boot rates up there with Batman Begins & Casino Royale. (It'll be interesting to see if the next Trek will bring us an excellent Dark Knight or a disappointing Quantum.)The casting is great! Zachory Quinto & Karl Urban (remember Bourne's main nemesis in Supremacy?) do a fine job at channeling Spock & McCoy. Whereas Chris Pine puts his own stamp on Kirk & it is a welcome one. It's great to have a sexy Uhura (Zoe Saldana sizzles in the role). The rest of cast is fun to watch too.I don't want to give anything away, but I was happy to see that Leonard Nimoy's presence is much more than a cameo. Eric Bana's villainous rebel Romulan is super intense & almost turns the fun faucet off at times, but I loved it!If you are a sci-fi nut then you will not find the story confusing. The action is whiz-bang & beautifully presented. There is a lot of eye-candy up on the screen.Like last year's Ironman, this is summer entertainment at its best. In fact, I like this new Trek better than Ironman (that final battle in Ironman dragged a bit).This Trek makes you wanting to take another one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"I saw this many years ago & I remember going to cinema with some trepidation . I am a Star Trek fan right from the Original Series ,through to The Next Generation, Voyager, DS9 . Plus all the previous films .
Star Trek is an idea of a Universe which ideally we should all strive for , all races, species, sexes , working together in the most wonderful way . Really did not want this new film to ruin the franchise.
Well , I was not disappointed , I came out of the cinema totally energised, entertained , and happy with the end result. Yes the film may have lens flares , lots of action , and the like , which may be construed as veering away from the previous Star Trek universe. But I actually think that this film benefitted from the advances in special effects in recent years which made the whole thing look more 'real' in a way. The previous incarnations of Trek were unable to benefit from this due to technical constraints and funds at the time they were made. But all the necessary ideals put forward by Roddenberry are all there . The casting is brilliant , and with a few notable differences are mostly the same as in the original series.
Obviously each to their own , but I for one was very impressed . My advice would be to ignore the naysayers who have just gone down the list of reviews and blindly put a thumbs down on any review that gives over a 7 and make up your own minds . LLAP 👍",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Live Long and Prosper!,"The new Star Trek film is simply amazing, and this is coming from someone who has never seen anything Star Trek before. The characters were strong, very well-developed. The screenplay was wonderfully written with much grace to action, humor, plot, and characters. J.J. Abrams proves to be a fantastic director, and he really is the future of this new franchise. The action scenes are stunning! They are so well edited, the effects are amazing. The action in this film is some of the best in a very long time, and Michael Bay should take hint at how to do a real action film. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are the stars here, both delivering fantastic performances. Having no history whatsoever on Star Trek stories, I can honestly say this was the perfect sci-fi action film, and a perfect way to introduce Star Trek to new audiences! BRAVO!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting Reboot Even If The Main Story Isn't Great,"This was preceded on Film4 with a short interview with JJ Abrams where he stated that during the production of this film he wasn't too bothered as to what the fans wanted and only concentrated on making a film that would appeal to cinema audiences . This is only to be congratulated because I watched this on the say day as Peter Capaldi was cast as the Doctor in DOCTOR WHO . If Moffat has scrawled through the DOCTOR WHO boards on this site we'd be getting a 20 something pretty boy again , something the show doesn't need and if you're making a movie profits need to be taken in to the equation . You make a film a handful of sad anoraks will love and everyone else hates you're talking a major failAbrams task is going to be very hard . The characters in STAR TREK aren't James Bond or DOCTOR WHO , they're characters immortalised by William Shatner , Leonard Nimoy but Abrams manages to pull it off and it's fascinating to watch characters who are fundamentally the same we know from the television series played by different actors and having slightly different character traits . Spock is probably the closest to being the same as the TV character being an emotionless logic Vulcan but his character is fleshed out and stops him from being a one note cypher that he could have been and even has an emotional scene that might surprise you . If there's a problem with reintroducing these characters then it's because they're all allotted a five to ten minute sequence that screams "" This is Chekov/Sulu/Scotty and the plot will now revolve around them for several minutes then we'll forget all about them after they've been introduced ""This interferes with the main story of a Romulan being on a revenge mission against the Federation and isn't all that strong a plot though to be honest it's much better than the one we got with the pretentious STAR TREK motion picture from 1979 . Perhaps one of the major problems is that the film never really recovers from the great opening pre-title sequence where a trick is played on the audience featuring Captain Kirk , and we're treated to a great action sequence and a couple of hours after seeing it I was very impressed by the sequence where a female crew member is blown out of a spaceship and her body bounces along the hull of the ship as the sound cuts to silence mirroring the empty silence of SpaceIn summary this is a relatively good action adventure Summer blockbuster featuring a legendary television franchise . I'm not a fan of STAR TREK but did enjoy seeing how a successful franchise can be reinvented and the character scenes work very well and I don't view this as any sort of heresy . It does get a bit loud , noisy and a little bit too spectacular but I guess this is down to it being a Summer blockbuster and believe me if it was made by Michael Bay it would have been a lot worse",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A well paced action adventure, but not a great Star Trek movie","I have mixed feelings about this movie. As a movie it is above average, a well paced action adventure with enough comic relief thrown in to break up the tension. As a Star Trek saga, however, it leaves a lot to be desired. I have the distinct impression that the director J.J. Abrams would much prefer to make a Star Wars movie.Now I like Star Wars, with it fanciful stories and supernatural theme; however, Star Trek is more the art of the possible with normal humans struggling in an alien universe. Roddenberry envisioned an idealistic society that existed on a well defined technological base. He closely guarded that vision and would not allow the established technological principals to be violated.Abrams was bound by no such vision. It is my impression that he purposefully strived to remake Star Trek into a variant of Star Wars. Gene Roddenberry would have hated Abrams movie.Go to my web site -- star-trek.fl-ink -- to read more about this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Star Trek Movie for Star Wars Fans,"This film made me a fan of Star Trek. I was always much more of a Star Wars fan than Star Trek. I never really cared too much about it until this film. Star Trek had been dead for years. The last Star Trek movie before this was bashed by critics and fans alike. After that Star Trek faded out for a while. Then J. J. Abrams rebooted it and gave it a new life. I'd say that it really paid off. Unlike the old Star Trek this film draws in a broader following. This new Star Trek not only appeals to long diehard fans of the franchise, but to newcomers, like me. I was not a fan of the old Star Trek. However, I saw this and became a fan of the franchise.The characters were solid. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do solid jobs as Kirk and Spock. The other actors do a fine job also. I like the cameo by Leonard Nemoy. I do wish they would have gotten William Shatner to make a cameo also, though. However, I thought that Uhura was unneeded as a character. It seems like she was just there for sex appeal and for forced drama.The effects are amazing. This film looks a lot like a Star Wars film. The film looks this way because J. J. Abrams worked on this film because he could not work on Star Wars yet. Some people might be turned off by this, but I did not mind the look. The story is also very competent. Some twists occurred that I did not see coming.Overall for die hard Star Trek fans this is a must see. Also, for people wanting to get into the franchise I'd say this is a good place to start out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

JJ Abrams at his best,"Those who gave this movie low marks must be very close minded, which is totally opposite what the Star Trek legacy teaches. I think Abrams is a genius, and have been a fan since TV'S Alias. His reboot is respectful of the original, but has enough ingenuity, humor and thoughtfulness to fill in the gaps left open by the originals. Examples: Kirk's birth and background, McCoy's nickname. Loved the homage to the iconic ""red shirt"" scene during the space jump. Olsen was wearing a red suit, predicting his imminent demise. Yes, there are a couple ""goofs"", but none that you notice until they are pointed out. Brilliant film. And Chris Hemsworth's debut in American film.

Star Trek with a cool touch,"Star Trek is back with a new visual overhaul that boldly shakes off all its previous incarnations with a daring, visually cool and escapist approach that appeals mainly to the senses and pleasantly switches off the mind.Seeing the characters re-cast and re-introduced with this fresh, contemporary approach creates a combination of feelings: a kind of nostalgia for the ""good old"" Star Trek and an expectation with a touch of skepticism over whether the magic could be indeed re-created.Even with a clever storyline, the success of any Star Trek film is bound to rely on the chemistry between the iconic crew. In spite of my initial doubts over the youthful, rebel-like depiction of Kirk, with the help of the - in this case - absolutely mandatory suspension of disbelief the cast look charmingly cool and manage to win over the sympathies of the majority of viewers. Although it will definitely fail to impress a die-hard Star Trek enthusiast for exactly the same reason, it all looks exciting and sexy again.With the main characters making their appearance on the screen, one by one, their lives gradually intertwining, building up the excitement, the film reaches a charming moment in which all of them are finally set up, positioned on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise in that well-known manner, all new and ready to start again, with ties and friendships that are about to span a lifetime.It all looks great and works best as an uplifting cola & pop-corn escapist spectacle, which, frankly, is what a lot of movie-goers appreciate the most.The filmmakers brewed out the essence of the ""old wonder"" that was Star Trek, the essence of each of the characters and the original idea, gave it a big stir and a brand new visual overhaul. This gives the film the necessary strength and cheekiness to shake down its previous incarnations and blast it off into an alternative, shiny new space.It all feels exciting, if not perhaps 100% believable, but this is, after all, a sci-fi movie and all comments about the plot's credibility would be rather pointless.I left the cinema feeling relaxed and refreshed from how nicely this worked - it's a pleasant movie to look at for guys and girls alike.The film worked and the follow-ups have an exciting youthful audience waiting for more.With such loaded history, a lot could have gone embarrassingly wrong. It didn't and it proved to be a new direction for Star Trek.A big recommendation for visual effects enthusiasts, popcorn munchers, if not so much perhaps for fans and fanatics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A perfect movie adaptation,"I haven't seen the original ST with Kirk and Spock completely. I tuned in too late and for me, it was a bit too slow to really enjoy. But I have seen The Next Generation and I have a weakness for the ST universe. It carries so much beautiful human values with it and this first movie of the new franchise is a perfect adaptation of the original intent I think.This movie has such a beautiful storyline where we witness the formation of the crew and the growing friendship of Kirk and Spock played out in a story with the threat of a perfectly casted Bana as a Romulan troublemaker. And to cross this bridge: the casting is just perfect. The whole crew feels like they're meant for each other and it feels like there's actual friendship, comradry, love and chemistry. Pine is a perfect blueeyed Kirk, I love Quinto (also due to his role as Sylar in Heroes) as the logical Spock, Urban as the always annoyed and urgent Bones, Pegg is a comedic master, Saldana is perfect as the linguistic master and girlfriend of Spock and Cho and Yelchin just top it off as the trustworthy pilot and the junior with the big brains and perfect voice intonation. The whole movie feels like a plan coming together. And there's an actual solid storyline and script.This franchise (I've seen all three movies) is a perfect mix of a good and deep backstory, with solid action, believable dialogues and lots of humour. It's really sad that Yelchin past away and leaves a gap and I hope a solid part IV will make it through the whole Hollywood commission and sees a green light.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie in star wars sequel and started it all for next generation,"This movie was ver y good restarting of a great series of movies. This is movie that started finally a new series of better movies.

You will miss dart hvader fighting his son and yoda saying very smart things.

You will like this movie the way it shows you the characters doing something different and not fighting a death star this time.After they make this movie, it must have made very many money because they were able to make six more movie, but unfortunately, the other new star wars will never be as good as this first one.

Enjoyable reboot of a classic with a few problems in the story logic,"Star Trek is a ""reboot"" of the classic franchise started by Gene Roddenberry as a little television show on NBC a few decades ago. In particular, this film revisits the original incarnation of Star Trek and the subsequent movies and creates a bit of a new origin story. With a very long history of lore and legions of fans, director J.J. Abrams and company had to both respect the story of Star Trek as it was and also tread new territory. They found an out that both respected the history of the overall franchise and let them rewrite it at the same time: the alternate universe. Using the long-standing tradition in Star Trek history, the reboot boldly takes us where no fan has gone before...The trouble all starts when revenge-bent Romulans from the future show up in the past, blowing up the ship that happens to be carrying the father of James (""Jim"") Tiberius Kirk, thus altering time forever. However, Kirk, with some prodding from Captain Christopher Pike (who Star Trek fans might remember from the pilot episode ""The Cage""), Kirk ends up repeating much of history anyhow. Meeting the various members of the crew that would form the Enterprise anyway, they respond to a distress call from Spock's home planet, Vulcan. Then a series of troubles occur involving the future-Romulans, amidst other things.The story itself is convoluted at times, requires a lot of faith from the audience and takes some rather contrived leaps of logic to propel it forward. Consequently, the actual mechanics of the story often are alarmingly strange. Why is the entire Federation Fleet on the other side of the galaxy? Why would they leave their various homeworlds completely unprotected? Furthermore, a number of plot holes show up throughout the film. This is very distracting from the emotional core of the story, which is actually quite good, focusing on the friendship between Kirk, Spock and Bones as well as keeping the rest of the classic Enterprise crew well involved. If you're willing to overlook the various leaps of logic in the story, then in terms of crafting tension and twists of fate, it serves its purpose well.One of the highlights of the film is the acting from the various players. Chris Pine does an acceptable job as Kirk, being a bit more brash and bad boy as well as generally avoiding the specific vocal inflections that William Shatner wrote into the character's legacy. Zachary Quinto's Spock was perhaps the farthest from the original portrayal, played with a lot more simmering emotion than Leonard Nimoy's original incarnation. Given the greater emphasis on Spock's human side in this incarnation, it makes sense. I also still had some trouble getting Quinto's Sylar character out of my head while watching him perform, which might have muddied my appreciation of the role. In some ways, it's the lesser members of the cast that seem to have benefited the most from this incarnation, each getting a chance to shine. Eric Bana on the other hand, gets a rather poorly drawn character to portray in Nero, having to rage and stomp around in a fit most of the time.There are a lot of cute Star Trek references thrown in throughout the film, which Star Trek fans might appreciate. The designs for the film do a surprising amount of respect to the original designs (although I still don't understand why the female crew members get stuck in the mini- dresses reflecting the original series) while ""modernizing"" the appearance to appeal to our circa 2009 sense of aesthetics. Special effects are expectedly good for a tentpole pic and the overall technical production is solid.Purists probably won't appreciate this film that much, due to its rather large deviance from canon. And anyone who bothers to think about the various story points will probably find it somewhat lacking. On the other hand, the film still does well in terms of its focus on the story of the Star Trek trio and keeps the story moving along. Personally, I find the story logic problematic enough that I was frequently distracted from the point. However, this is still a rather engaging and entertaining movie, despite those problems. It'll still be a solid distraction for those looking for a fun movie, but losing the sci-fi for adventure and its hand-waving conceits keep it from the greatness that I've heard it reflected. Which, I guess, puts it in the range of the rest of the more enjoyable Star Trek films. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful Reboot,"They nailed it with this reboot. Chris Pine is the perfect Kirk - brash and cocky, he reminds us of the young Shatner while making the role his own.

"i am giving this film a nod of approval as it has done what it set out to do, reintrist the younger generations into loving a timeless story with relatable characters.","I want to start by uploading the directors, reviving a story that many adults like my parents and grandparents remembered when they were younger as the child of a baby boomer my parents grow up watching the adventures of kirk and Spock. Like my parents when I was young we watched the original Star Trek as well. This new movie has perfectly captured the wonder and adventure of kids and adults alike once again. This film after watching a few times you start seeing scenes that didn't need to be there. If you don't understand what I mean by this, ill elaborate. You will be watching and towards the middle of the original crew will start entering the scenes and your realize there taking a really long time to gather everyone only after each new crew member there's a scene that is almost completely pointless almost like the director needed to extend the run time so they through some jokes and poor attempts at gags to amuses the viewer to diloud the long intermissions between the story and the characters. I would like to point out and continue the last idea that they wasted time in the story for run time. In the beginning few minutes we are immediately introduced to the antagonist and a tragedy starts this entire scene was a waste of time for the viewer in something that could have been explained in 2 minutes by a side character, but alas we are given almost 10 minute of a wasted scene.
World immersion is something many writers and producers have trouble getting their audience into; however, in the film we are immediately given key examples showing how people join star fleet and if you are like me, a mega lover of star trek, you would know the details of how people enlisted, and from what I could find this was almost everything was perfect, even including other alien races into the academy just to further immerse the viewer. J J abroms had spent his time creating characters that you would remember even if they were only on screen for a minute. Once the film really got started you almost felt like you were one of the crew members, rathers then feeling like a Q forced to observe for all of time. The viewer would feel like he was part of the crew and you where really with Kirk and Spock on one of there classic missions to explore the cosmos.
I will finnish by giving this film a nod of approval as it has done what it set out to do, reintrist the younger generations into loving a timeless story with relatable characters. With new TV series on the way; like Star Trek Discovery session 3 and the new star Trek Picard and the production of a new movie, we can expect to see the Star Trek franchise to continue and grow for many generations to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not Star Trek","For a nerd like me, this movie is worth it just to see the new going-to-warp computer animation. The movie however, is not very Star Trek-ish. Star Trek is, as many have pointed out before me, about the ideas. Ideas like in the future, we have so advanced technology that no-one needs to be poor. Abundant energy and replicator technology make everything almost free. Thus famine and greed have been eliminated, and people of this future are instead working to improving themselves and working for their ideals.The original Star Trek ideas was, for instance, problems is possible to solve without violence, racism does not exist and compassion and dialogue is used actively in diplomatic situations. Ideas that say we shouldn't interfere with the developments of aliens on other planets, but wait to make contact until they have developed warp technology. Ideas like if we create robots or an android with artificial intelligence, it automatically have every right a living being would. If they are alive, we have no right to abuse them as laborers. Watching the older Star Trek series and films can teach you a lot.The Star Trek 2009 movie have very few of these ideas. Star Trek 2009 uses the amazing sci-fi from the Star Trek universe, but leaves out this interesting future culture. It's an action-blast with little of the Star Trek soul. They try compassion, but fail with a smirk undertone and no real effort in saving an enemy. I find this very alien to the older Star Trek. Maybe we can expect two star trek types in the future, one for the kids and one for young adults.The Star Trek Enterprise series from 2001 seems to be a mix. We get perspective and good insight because of the high intelligent scripts, but also a lot more action and violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Review of Star Trek,"Speaking as someone who has never seen the original Star Trek films or watched any of the TV shows, I wasn't very excited when I heard about this film because I didn't know anything about the Star Trek universe. However, when I saw the trailer, I was very interested in checking the film out and I'm glad I did. I've heard that this film was geared towards people like me, the younger generation. People who had never been introduced to Star Trek. I was very thrilled by this film and it definitely left me wanting to see more. The cast was very good, the story was well done and the whole feel of the film was just epic. In so many ways, it was my kind of film, which is so ironic to me because I've always viewed Star Trek as ""not my thing"". After seeing this film, I don't think I want to go and see the older Star Trek films. Not because I think they'd be bad compared to this one, but because I feel like the new Star Trek is more my thing and I want to embrace that. Maybe someday I'll check out the older films, but right now I'm just looking forward to another Star Trek film in this new series. I will definitely go out and buy this film and I would recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi or action films. Even if you've never seen any version of Star Trek, this film is a blast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great movie, also for non-fanatics","I have never considered myself to be a Star Trek fan. As a matter of fact I actually never understood the big deal about the slow paced, static television series that is apparently loved by many ""Trekkies"" all over the world. In the sci-fi genre the Star Wars series was always considered to be superior by me, because of its sense of humor, great action scenes and in my opinion more likable species and characters. Having heard good things about this movie, I still went to see it with some friends who are more into Star Trek and I was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of action, humor and special effects to go around and the environment looks better than it has ever been. This all did not go at the expense of a good story. I liked the plot and while not overly complex, the story is complex enough to keep me interested. Having seen this movie I am enthusiastic for a new star trek movie by JJ Abrams.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredible Effects, Questionable Resurrection","This film really has two different views, how good a movie it is and how good a Star Trek resurrection it is. As a movie it's a fun big-budget action film. The effects were incredible, exactly what every movie should aspire to emulate. Computer effects were used where necessary and attention was paid to the detail so it never detracted from the story. Physical effects/action were used where they would be best appreciated and would help to keep the audience (and actors) in the story. The plot was coherent enough for enjoyment, though it was clearly an action film and not a drama. I'm not sure how humorous it would be if you're not familiar with the Star Trek characters, but there were enough little tidbits just for the fun of it that everyone should get at least a chuckle or two. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good shoot 'em up time. If you're a big Trek fan, I (and my mother, also a big Trek fan) thought these characters were very believable as the younger selves of the original icons. All the necessary nods were included and most of the humor stemmed from this. That said, I'm not sure I could ever watch another film with these characters. The story veered greatly from the original history and some of the branches are just a little too weird for my fan comfort (I'm sure someone with spoilers will make mention of these few oddities). I liked having this glimpse into their youth but if any future movie is made I hope they will place new characters into this universe with the same style, careful action and fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beam me up Scotty! I'm ready to be a Star Trek fan.,"My Take: This new STAR TREK is bound to recapture the hearts of its fans, while also being accessible to a wider audience.I usually go see movies in theaters when it's worth it. As much as possible, I really don't want to see a movie I can see for free on television. If I only get to go in theaters this year, I'm glad, thus far, that among them is STAR TREK. It's one of the biggest and, in my opinion, one of the very best movies of the summer so far. If this is the only movie I see this summer, I still wouldn't feel so swindled.Let me start by pointing out that I'm not a Trekkie (Trekker?), but I did see enough Star Trek movies, even loved a few (STAR TREK III and IV so far), to familiarize me enough with these characters. Other than that, my loyalties to this are extremely limited. But it turns out, I could buy a ticket and not know anything about STAR TREK, and I still will come out having a grand time at the movies. I always thought STAR TREK as a film franchise, whilst not exactly strong blockbuster contenders, have mostly been interesting on the big screen, alternating spaced-out action sequences with space opera and Shakespearean villains, but this new STAR TREK is probably the best so far, particularly because the film opens its doors to other than its fans. Trek fans may reunite, but everyone will still have enough fun with STAR TREK. I sure did!The movie serves as both a prequel as well as a reboot to the screen franchise, while it's also a great way for fans to catch up with the dangling threads left behind by their beloved characters. The movie opens with the introduction of George Kirk, the first officer of the federation ship The Kelvin, who takes command of the vessel when it's attacked by Romulans, led by the vengeful Captain Nero (the scenery-chewing Eric Bana). He's, of course, none other than the father of the then-famous James Tiberius Kirk. Forward 22 years later, grows up into a rebellious youth (Chris Pine), wasting the good name of the father he never really knew. But during a brawl in a bar, he is inspired by a Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in the Starfleet Academy. It's so nice to see everyone's favorite characters refreshingly enjoyable again. Though it's a stretch, it's nice to see Kirk as a sort of rebel without a cause and Nyota Uhura (then played by Nichelle Nichols) as a sexy, miniskirt-clad Zoe Saldana. It's also nice to see ""Doc Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), Hikaru Zulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and especially Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (who else but Simon Pegg) in their younger forms after (or is that before? Never mind) their shoes were worn by the late DeForrest Kelley, George Takei, Walter Koenig and James Doohan. But perhaps the most delightful is Zachary Quinto's impression of Mr. Spock, baring both a sort of uncanny resemblance and impersonation. When he does an impression of Spock's trademark eyebrow raise, I cheered.One of the main reasons I liked the original STAR TREK movies is the camaraderie and quirky relationship between these characters. These characters probably wouldn't be nearly as effective as individual folk, but are always so good together. Seeing them, as if for the first time, on J.J. Abrams new STAR TREK is having that very same feeling Michael J. Fox' character in BACK TO THE FUTURE felt upon seeing his parents as teenagers. It's nice to see these characters we know and love, yet being acquainted with them in a different way. For anyone looking for a more contemporary comparison, Batman fans felt the same feeling when they saw BATMAN BEGINS and later, THE DARK KNIGHT.The plot is a stretch to be sure, taking place in the past while creating a sort of alternate reality that changes the outcome of the future events portrayed in the previous movies, but in such an event, plot contrivances don't matter as long as the plot can carry the film's 126 minutes and is able to reintroduce us to these characters we have known and loved. There's even a cameo/bit role by Leonard Nimoy, reminding us of the things of the past (or is that the future? Whatever). But fan you may be or not, STAR TREK is a fast, highly entertaining and exciting blockbuster with some genuine excitement and a few great laughs along the way. This 'Trek' is a nostalgia trip at warp speed that's bound to live long and prosper in all of us for years to come.Rating: ***** out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superlative Movie - And That's No Hyperbole!,"I am definitely giving this movie a ten star rating. I'd give it more if I could. This is the best movie I have seen so far this year! I am not a serious Trekkie by any means. I know the members of the crew of the Original Series, but not with too much familiarity. But for a casual Star Trek fan like me, this prequel is really excellent! Excellent story. Excellent casting. Excellent technicals. Excellent execution.The film begins with the birth of James Tiberius Kirk and it never lets up on the drama, the action, the science fiction, no holds barred. There is heavy drama even before the credits. (My wife already was teary-eyed by the end of that sequence!) Even when the story grapples with time travel, warps and black holes, you never get lost with the flow. The logic is always there. None of the usual plot holes that beset stories that deal with time.I really have to complement the casting director. The new cast is amazing in its portrayal of the crew which millions of fans know and loved over the years. They have collectively succeeded in recapturing the spirit and character of the individual Enterprise crew members as young cadets. Kudos to Chris Pine as J.T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock. They really possess the essence of the characters, and the evolution of their friendship is very believable as portrayed. Apart from John Cho (as Sulu), the other actors are not really known to me, and this is an additional plus. The guy who played the young Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) also did very well, as with the guy who played Scotty (Simon Pegg).I congratulate the director J. J. Abrams for this bold visual spectacle that went well beyond my expectations. I went in the movie house with very high expectations due to the very positive word of mouth. I was definitely NOT disappointed. I exhort all of you to watch this movie on the big screen as it deserves to be watched. I think this movie would be a classic the appeal of which will never fade even after repeated viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal!,"Director JJ Abrams has outdone himself this time with this new Star Trek reboot/prequel. It simply tells the story of the early days of Captain Kirk and Mr Spock from the Star Trek we all know and love. But the difference between this and the original TV series and movies is that this Star Trek has the privilege of special effect visualization.The visual effect is astounding! JJ Abrams managed to create something as massive as a planet and the USS Enterprise look so real. It is like we are there. To add to the realism, there are creative uses of lens flare (those lights that are reflected at the screen throughout the movie) that makes it look like the camera is actually out there filming the scenario.The soundtrack is epic. It has the combination of orchestra and choir which really complement the sequence shown.I also like the fact that there are several silent scenes showing the outer space. One where the Romulan drilling vessel is attacking the Federation starship. The Federation starship is damaged, a silhouette of a crew member drifting in outer space with explosions and shooting still going on in the background, yet there is no sound. And when Kirk and Sulu dive from the Enterprise to enter Vulcan, there was only silence until after they enter the planet's atmosphere. Usually, a sci-fi film would ignore the fact that sound can't travel in vacuum to make a scene seem cooler. But the fact that Star Trek acknowledges this just adds more to its realism.Regarding the acting; everyone was great. The star of this movie is, obviously, Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, showing off the character's rebellious and cocky, and ultimately, leadership side. Zachary Quinto playing the iconic Spock was logical. He may not have the same deep and commanding voice Leonard Nimoy has, but the other resemblance of characteristic is undeniable. The rest of the crew -- Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, and especially Simon Pegg as the babbling Scotty -- did an appraisable job forming a team that would make Star Trek lasts throughout the ages. And of course Leonard Nimoy himself had no problem taking back the role of the original Spock.This movie is for everyone. No matter if you're a trekkie, a film-addict or just a casual movie-goer, you will be purely entertained as I did.The directing is superb. The editing and camera angles are sleek. The storyline and the storytelling itself is very engaging; holding your breath and grabbing your attention in the most mind-numbing sequence, Star Trek is everything a summer blockbuster should be like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek with a Death Star to destroy,"In the 1980's there was more cross-over than clash between fans of Star Trek and Star Wars as I recall. The last I saw of that rivalry was in the movie Fanboys which - though very entertaining - was given a release reserved for would-be sleeper hits and then it just never woke up. The verdict is pretty well in for Star Trek (2009) and a possible revival of interest in that brand, which would add insult to injury for Star Wars fans (who have had to endure their own prequels culminating in the animated Clone Wars and Jabba the Hutt's heretofore unheard of larvae son) except for the oft repeated term ""Star Wars-style reboot."" There is plenty of action and humor, without the long sequences of staring into a bright light or long drawn out space-dock departures with any floating of people or things from one place to the other miles away feeling like the trip must occur in real time. I think this is the first time I remember seeing a Star Trek shuttle travel quickly. Ebert nit-picked a few things I couldn't care less about. If you buy warp drive and you buy teleportation then it's not much of a leap to say that a beaming genius might figure out a formula for doing one during the other.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's not bad!,"Having never seen a Star Trek movie (or even TV episode for that matter) i went into this 'reboot' with no expectations or ill feelings, as i understand such films can divide fans of said franchise.My overall impressions were, 'it's not bad', ok, that doesn't sound too good a review, but i came away thinkings that was 'alright', nothing more, nothing less.The cast and special effects were all decent, and i can appreciate from a non-fan view, this film is set before the events of the very first series. It was pretty simple to grasp who was to become who, i mean i haven't been under a rock the last 40 years! I obviously know some characters even without seeing an episode, so it wasn't a problem following the story in that regard.The start of the film was really good and had me guessing if that was Kirk at that point at least! But certainly it was a dramatic and emotional start to the film. But after that, following Kirk felt a little short in places, and felt rushed to fulfil the part of the story to get him onboard.I felt the main part of the storyline was a bit basic and seemed to shoved into the gap around showing how the characters came to be rather than anything else.Zachary Quinton was superb as Spock, although Simon Pegg came across as too comical as his character (ironically).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Trek is Back and Better than Ever,"I have been a Star Trek fan since I caught the Original Series in reruns back in the early 70's. I am a huge fan of TOS and I was a bit concerned that JJ ABrams would turn this franchise into a 90120 in outer space and abandon the core values of Trek left to us by the Creator, Gene Roddenberry. After seeing the movie last night at our IMAX theater, my worries evaporated and morphed into uncontainable excitement and wonder. This new Trek was a mind-blowing experience, the stunning visuals and special effects, Abrams was able to communicate the spectacular feeling of being in space and truly showing how magnificent the USS Enterprise is in her element.The actors were amazing and brought each of the icons they were playing to life. Chris Pine oozed cockiness and leadership, Zachacy Quinto made you feel Spock's inner turmoil and conflicted emotions and Karl Urban WAS ""Bones"" McCoy. The rest of the cast was, pardon the pun, stellar. Zoe Saldana brought a great charm and intelligence to Uhura, John Cho exhibited his swordsmanship and humor and the oh so young Alton Yelchin played Chckov's accent up in a believable manner yet got to show off his mad science skills. Special kudos to Bruce Greenwood for bringing Captain Christopher Pike to life and being a mentor to the rebellious young Kirk.This is the best Star Trek since The Wrath of Khan. It has the depth of emotion we expect from Star Trek while still telling an amazing space opera story that takes you into the depths of outer space as well as the depths of human & Vulcan emotion. Eric Bana's Nero is the weakest element of the story. With a running time just over two hours, they just couldn't fit more of his back story in which leaves his character a bit unfinished in the movie. The writers of the film did do a prequel graphic novel that explains how the events of this movie were triggered and fills out the Nero back-story. If you love this film and want to know more, I highly recommend the Star Trek: Countdown graphic novel. Otherwise, this movie blew all of my expectations out of the water and more than thrilled me with the confidence that JJ Abrams and company know exactly how to make a Star Trek epic. This franchise will boldly go and live long and prosper with this cast and crew. A must see movie for Trekker and newcomer alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sheer AWESOMENESS,"I should start off by quoting a fellow movie goer at the end of this film. ""Dude, you just missed the best movie ever."" And to date, it is.Star Trek was a fantastic rendition of a familiar legendary series with many a devoted fan, and few will be disappointed. I was not among them.There are very few complaints I have about the movie, so I wish to get them out of the way first. Number one is the music, I was not sold on it. I liked the ending when they brought back the original tune from the regular Star Trek with no attempts to jazz it up or to alter it. Second, Zachary Quinto, I was not fully confident in his ability to portray Spock, he wasn't a complete failure, but I believe that his ability to further portray the character will show itself in a sequel. We'll see then.I cannot say that there is a perfect movie, because no movie is perfect, however it doesn't get better than this. The acting was superb, the casting was nearly pitch perfect, the action breathtaking, and it leaves you feeling good and fulfilled. When I see a movie I want to leave feeling good about the experience, so does everyone else, and this has done it. I laughed, I cried, I fidgeted during times of stress on the characters, it was a fun experience.I have to say my favorite parts of this movie are those involving the first ever Spock, Mr. Leonard Nimoy. He has the ability to command the screen with quiet confidence that few actors will ever accomplish, he is indeed commendable.Please see this movie; fan or no.

Look at his resume': Alias, Lost, Fringe, Cloverfield, Felicity, Mission Impossible 3, Joy Ride, Armageddon, Forever Young, and even Regarding Henry! This guy has a great imagination.

Abrams and his crew made sure that the movie would be enjoyable for EVERYONE. The 126 minutes run-time felt like 10 minutes at most - the film is paced incredibly well. There's not one boring moment.The excellent cast helps too. I was most impressed by Chris Pine, who was simply excellent for the role of Kirk.Overall, just go see this movie. I could go on and on about how great the CGI was, how well done the dialog was (has to be Orci's and Kurtzman's best work yet) and how fitting the music was (Michael Giacchino)... but the truth is, you just have to see it for yourself.Live long and prosper.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie is a technological masterpiece! The SFX just blew my mind with all the attention to detail and realism that they had. The sound effects were brilliant, every hit and punch would go through your ribcage and the score is fantastic.The plot revolves around the early years of James Tiberius Kirk and his crew as they meet each other for the first time, I have to mention this but I'm sure the fans were having a blast every time a ""new"" character was introduced. The plot has several twists and turns but it's not too complex and the regular movie goer will understand it.The acting is nothing to write home about, don't expect any Oscar nominations for it, but the actors carried their roles pretty well making them likable and real. Don't expect anything that will blow your mind from the acting department although it was solid.Now I'd like to address the issue of the ""cheesiness"" I hear people complaining about, this movie is Star Trek and it's supposed to be cheesy just as Doctor Who needs to be quirky, it's part of the charm the series has.Overall I'd recommend this movie to every Trekkie, sci-fi fan and even your average movie goer, watch it you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lots of arguing criticism,"I'm so great fan of SCI FI films & of course STAR TREK is my number one as series, or as films. I believe that after Rondenberry died, other directors & producers have the right to create their concept about the Federation, either in respect of the time sequence & the main philosophy of the original creator, or without them. A nice film is based on an acceptable script, on professional acting, on a respectable budget, etc. Personally I'd accept & be fond of a Star Trek film or series, even not in absolute terms with the sequence, or the philosophy of the original concept, as long as it fulfills the above characteristics. I liked the film even if I keep my reservations too about some scenes, some actions like the one mentioned in others comments saying that in the environment of a Starfleet, no officer would ever drop out of a spaceship a fellow officer just because they had a serious agreement. There are ways to solve even the greater disagreement. But lets not stand on this kind of endless discussions about details or scenes, or time lines...

"That's what I call a ""Re-Imagining""","The first Trailer I saw for this Star Trek movie, didn't look like a Star Trek movie at all. Actually when I saw the first frames of the Trailer (I didn't know it would be a Star Trek trailer, because I watched it in a cinema), I thought this was a trailer for the ""Fast & Furious"" (2009) movie. A fast car, someone following that car, an insane stunt ... you'd be forgiven for thinking this was an car stunt movie ...And you might have had doubts about the end result of this movie. Especially if you were a fan of the Original Series and movies. This looked like some action movie, that had nothing to do with the charm that Kirk & Co were able to achieve on screen. And again you would be wrong. Of course William Shatner is a character in his own rights and he played ""James T. Kirk"" as only he himself could play a role like that. But having said that, this new ""Tiberius"" is great, too. In fact since this is Science Fiction, the explanation why we get a new ""Kirk"" is a pretty good one (imho).Even my casting concerns, weren't an issue. The guy from Harold and Kumar in a Star Trek movie? Simon Pegg is great, but what is he doing in a Science Fiction movie? Well they all fit the bill. It's a fun ride and it can only get bumpy, if you really try to compare it too much with the Original Series. You shouldn't do that!

Holy Lens Flare Captain!!!!,"With the recent surge in reboots of franchises and remakes, J.J. Abrams goes into a little different direction, and uses time travel as a device to play in both worlds, that being the original series and the new reboot he has created. The result is a highly entertaining film with great special effects and good performances.Going through a black hole and destroying a federation ship, Nero has altered the current time line and created an alternate universe. He's exacting revenge on other planets because his was destroyed. Can the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise stop him in time? I never watched the original series with Shatner, and caught a few episodes of The Next Generation because my dad would watch them. The series seemed to be running out of gas in films, with every single film being about throwing the ships shield's up and pretending to be hit by missiles in space. I welcome this so called 're-boot' with open arms, the series needed it in my opinion. Abrams and co have created something special here and I'm interested in seeing where they take this series.The casting choices work for me, I knew enough of the original characters to know this. For me, Urban as McCoy is the best casting decision. Quinto from Heroes fame fills the shoes of Spock, he looks the part and plays the part well. The guy looks evil every time you look at him. Pegg as Scotty is a given and newcomer Pine does the role justice and I'm glad he didn't try to impersonate Shatner here. Everyone works in their supporting roles and we are introduced to them by the numbers. I was a tad upset to only see Pegg introduced near the end of the film, but here's hoping we see more of him in future installments.The special effects were stunning. I noticed they employed the same technique used in the short lived brilliant television show Firefly, which employed quick zooms and having objects and people out of focus for a brief second while in space. Although, I'm sure during the scenes in space, it would be silenced, such as the girl flying out of the ship in the opening and Kirk & Sulu descending on the drill. Yet in other scenes we would hear the explosions of the missiles and so on. Inconsistent, but not a huge problem.The way the film is shot is beautiful, but I could do with a little less of the lens flare. I understand that it was intentional, but near the end of the film is became a little overbearing and distracting. Also Bana is underused in my opinion. I could have used a bit more with him and Kirk in the climax.The film starts off with a bang and the adrenaline is there at the end as well. The film slows down in some parts, but this is needed to fill in the spots of the story. A story that is well written and with Abrams behind the camera, well directed. Abrams has finally made the jump from television to film. His first try was the mediocre Mission Impossible III. With Star Trek it seems this guy has no fear, taking on two films that belong in a franchise, kudos.Trek is entertaining, funny and will draw in a new audience. I had a great time in the theatre and liked every minute of it. I can't wait to see the direction they take this new and exciting series. Thanks for not disappointing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good action plus inane details equals still good movie,"This was a very unusual movie for me because I did find it entertaining on the one hand, but also very annoying in its frequent lack of common sense and respect for its genre. Looking just at the entertainment value, one could certainly give the film a 7 or 8 for action that moves along well, relatively engaging characters and a script free of the heavy Trek-jargon that often weighs down television episodes. However, as a science fiction fan I found many details of the film just plain silly. I'm sure a hardcore Trek fan could cite dozens of gaffs, but one of the more obvious is the construction of the Enterprise - a very large ship not designed to operate in an atmosphere - on the surface of the Earth rather than in orbit; also bizarre were starships maneuvering mere meters away from a ""black hole"" without being torn apart by gravity ~ the sort of detail that makes one wonder if the black hole in question was actually meant to be wormhole but was renamed a ""black hole"" to sound more ominous. One idea that I do like (actually implied in the script) is that this movie is set in a parallel universe quite distinct from the original Star Trek, and I think the very action of the movie ~ tampering with history for the sake of vengeance ~ would make it easier to free oneself from attachment to the background of classic Trek if one is a die-hard fan. But even so, Kirk's ultimate reward for his heroism (let me avoid a spoiler) is out of all proportion to his gallingly inappropriate conduct at Starfleet Academy. A basically good movie? I guess. But compromising between an 8 for brisk action and a 4 for many flaws in logic and common sense, I offer a 6 instead. The odds are, most viewers will be entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly Amazing,"I admit I have not seen any of the previous Star Trek films. I'm more of a Star Wars person in comparaison.However this new reboot of Star Trek, is truly amazing.Being a fan of J.J Abrams is one of the reasons I was anticipating this film. This however is not the reason why i enjoyed the film.The story is very well told for new audiences, who are unfamiliar with the star trek universe. I didn't think i would care much for the characters, but I ended up loving them all, as the film was both emotional and exciting.Throughout the film I was kept on the edge of my seat and the action scenes are very fun to watch.I urge anyone who is either a fan or not to see this film, as you will get something completely different out of it.A true cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Star Trek An Entertaining Sci-Fi Action Adventure Remake,"Star Trek is an entertaining sci-fi action adventure remake. I thought there were some flaws which I'll get to later but the good more than outweighed the bad with this one. Director J. J. Abrahams has done an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen and he continues to show his talent as a filmmaker. Well done. Star Trek has it all character development, action, drama, suspense, humor, and a little romance. The cast including John Cho as Sulu, Bruce Greenwood as Pike, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saladana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime are very effective in their limited screen time. Winona Ryder shows up for a cameo role as Spocks mother and she's good in her brief part. The two stands outs were Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. They both were impressive as their characters who the story seemed to focus on the most. The two characters I found to to be a little weak in the cast were Anton Yelchin as Chekov mainly because his Russain accent was a bit strong at times and Eric Bana as the villain Nero a Romulan Captain with a major grudge who doesn't have much to do except look mad. They both are talented actors and weren't in it all that much anyways so neither of them really hurt the film. But I just thought their performances weren't as good as others. No offense. The action sequences are well paced with a compelling story and amazing special effects that help bring the film to life. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie but I enjoyed up liking it. Star Trek was much better than G.I. Joe or Wolverine which weren't the greatest films at least to me. I felt entertained after watching this movie so it's definitely worth seeing. Overall despite some flaws if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi adventure with character development, action, suspense, drama, and humor. Then look no further Star Trek is the movie for you. It won't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, I'd forgotten how much I love Star Trek","This is quite possibly the best 'reboot' a franchise has ever gotten. I hadn't watched anything Star Trek in so long that I'd forgotten how much I loved the universe and the characters in it, and this movie definitely reminded me. The dialogue is wonderful, the acting is right where it needs to be, and the direction was another hit out of the park by JJ. I literally have no complaints. It's both an action AND story packed 2 hours that is so massive and enthralling it left my head spinning (and a movie hasn't done that to me in years).Even if you're not a Trekkie, GO SEE IT. This could very well change your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Re-Engage,"We know what to expect from a ""Star Trek"" movie, thirty plus years after ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". Perhaps this is because the franchise has kept it all in the family up till now. The majority of films have been directed by people involved in the ""Star Trek"" universe for years. The thought of an outsider venturing into the realm of ""Star Trek"" and directing the re-launch of their precious franchise is enough to make a Vulcan's ears straighten out. I mean, the last time an interloper put his stamp on a ""Trek"" adventure, the result was the Stuart Baird-directed ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", considered a failure on all fronts.So, it's refreshing to see TV guru J.J. Abrams not just succeed, but overwhelmingly so in delivering a fresh, relevant and exciting take on a new ""Trek"" tale. Even more impressive is that ""Transformers"" scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzmann developed an ingenious device to appease long-time Trekkers and newcomers alike. Said device is a black hole that creates an alternate ""Trek"" universe early in the film. This allows the filmmakers to have fun with shades of the ""Trek"" characters we know and love, yet gives them a chance to re-make and re-discover them in a new adventure. It's a great story design and that rare occasion where a time travel story has no glaring flaws. ""Back to the Future II"", a movie that is built on traversing space and time, had a major error in its depiction of time travel* and even another ""Star Trek"" film, ""First Contact"", mishandled time travel*. But if you follow the characters of this movie in and out of wormholes, go home and draw out a schematic diagram of exactly what happened, it make sense! The plot details involve Spock traveling back in time on the heels of Romulans, who are convinced Spock caused the destruction of their home planet. The Romulans are bent on revenge and destroying Vulcan with a mysterious substance called Red Matter. At this point in time, youthful Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of the crew are getting their feet wet on the bridge of The Enterprise after the original Captain, Christopher Pike, is captured by the Romulans.The tech aspects of the movie are top-notch, killing the old notions of cheesy FX that have haunted this franchise in the past. Also top notch is the casting, succeeding in many different ways. Chris Pine as Kirk brings the right machismo and sense of humor to rival straight-as-an-arrow, logic-based Zachary Quinto, nailing the role of Spock. The early-relationship standoffs between Kirk and Spock are a lot of fun, almost playing out like the romantic comedy couple who hate each other that you know will be together in the end. There is romance in this film that wakes Trek fans out of the coma they've been put in by Picard's stodgy relationships (he deserved sexier times). There's a romantic liaison between Spock and Uhuru (a concept straight out of ""alternate universe"") that works as a romance and for comedy fodder as something else to come between Kirk and Spock. Karl Urban has his best role since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as ""Bones"" McCoy. His role isn't as re-imagined as some of the others, instead, he flavors his role with the best parts of DeForest Kelley's original portrayal, to hilarious effect.Eric Bana does a fine job as the revenge-bent Romulan, reminding audiences that a real THREAT is essential to an adventure movie. Once the threat is real and potent, a movie can have all sorts of fun underneath that umbrella, and ""Star Trek"" does. Take note, Indiana Jones. In fact, George Lucas, why don't you give J.J. Abrams a call",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Excellent portrayals of beloved characters,"I loved the characters in star trek - I am one of the 60's original star trek fans who thought the stories stunk till the movies came out but I always loved the characters. This remake is a little too much star wars like as has been sited in the other reviews, and I have never been a star wars fan - never engaged in the characters or storyline. I also found the music annoying at times, pulling me me out of the scene and back into a theater where I was irritated by the music. But I loved the actors portrayals of beloved characters. Since there can be no more star treks with the old crew as we are all old, I would love to see some new ones with a new crew who keeps alive the original characters. Since I cannot return to a simpler time, I do appreciate what has been offered as homage to Gene Roddenberry and the actors who came back from a justifiable cut from television (really BAD scripts and stories) to create one of the most beloved series of movies in my lifetime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Forceful Relationship Between Entertainment Cinema and Its Audiences.,"J.J. Abrams is, as has been made quite evident by now, a time traveler at heart, a heart which loves everything old: old faces, old times, old manners, old franchises. In an age when cinema has become entirely its own storytelling beast, its own approach to manifesting drama, the more accustomed acting for the camera being less and less drawn from the theatre, one greatly admires the work of actors like Chris Pine, the malleable concrete which forms the basis of Captain Kirk's reconstruction, and Zachary Quinto, who has a look of infinite dexterity in his obvious physical proclivity for Spock, who don't have to bounce around and reel off monologues ridden with words accentuated on paper with all caps, instead utilizing the great amount of character in their faces. They are never uninteresting. But before I allow you to conclude that my point is that this new Star Trek reboot is a unique, unadulterated piece of talent free from its interrelations of media bondage, it should be made clear that it is a big ""Hey, how ya doin'?"" for Trekkies, much of the impact of the story being implicit to followers of the half-century franchise. To boot, the film's highly creative director J.J. Abrams, perhaps due to the lion's share of his career having been spent in epic TV projects, directs this starter-up as if it were the pilot to an all-new Star Trek TV series. I have never been more conscious of the fact that the story arch will not conclude here but in multiple sequels to come.The pre-title sequence is incredible. The intensity of the action and the emotional impact of the scene's progression are not taken for granted, as Abrams makes great use of the music score and manipulation of sound to augment it all to full effect. Flash-forward to the rebellious youth of angry, reckless, fatherless James Tiberius Kirk. This segment is just about the only one in the whole film that loosens up within the iron grip of a domineering fan base. Once again, the music choice is interesting, the scene is loaded with action and implications of the futuristic setting, any and everyone is enjoying themselves.Writers Orci and Kurtzman seem to fully understand that genre films often include clearcut plot assurances like moral certainties and action set pieces so that solving the film's conflicts can be submitted to the genre. Even parodies or criticisms of a genre rely on the audience's acquaintance with it. Thus, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek succeeds within its genre. I suppose what makes me less than partial to this film is the general ideological notions of the world of Star Trek.Where Star Wars presents a story of intelligence in the universe existing a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, full of interplanetary travel on an everyday, almost casual basis, suggesting the fascinating notion of life on Earth possibly in the prehistoric era, Star Trek suggests that humanity on Earth, primarily Americans with the exception of a few token foreigners with characteristic specialties, is the ennobled savior of the universe against countless other forms of intelligence which learn more from us than we learn from them. I believe that if Romulans can emerge from the future to create black holes out of planets and Vulcans can live for hundreds of years and share thoughts, experiences, memories and knowledge through physical contact, not to mention live by the phrase ""Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations,"" which we still have yet to discover, it is not likely that they are the less evolved or efficient beings in comparison to humans.Both films and their audiences are culturally operated. What a film means can and does change, but basic idealized views are taken for granted by the story. These conclusions are rooted in reiteration, which leads us to assume things unless they are outwardly countered. But that alone is not the mark of the text. It may assume particular messages and inferences, but it exists to take risks, to work through theoretical dilemmas, the purpose of the movie hero breaking new ground in relation to such things. In part due to this movie in particular being a franchise rejuvenation, they are not reproduced so much as refreshed, not so much repeated as reworked.The fascination of film is reinforced by initial fascination already at work within the subject and the social establishments that molded it. Indeed, the filmmakers would've found their balls in a salad shooter if they disappointed enough fans. I believe that there is a lot about this movie's creative process that I have yet to know, hence I am sure that this film is more of a success than I realize.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie Thoughts: The New Star Trek,"And so, I watched the new Star Trek flick directed by JJ Abrams on Friday morning for $6 (since it was before noon at AMC) with some buddies. It was massively entertaining and I liked it just like everybody else who came with me, although I did have one major nitpick about it (although those who see it will probably know exactly what I mean... but I understand fully why they did that). Definitely, worth watching again. The casting and the acting was excellent. I loved the little fanboy elements, small little details that elevated my appreciation of it, and the visuals are colorful, optimistic, while being mature in its execution. Despite the fact that I was more on the Star Wars side of the Trekkie-Jedi spectrum (at least before the prequels), I did love the old Star Trek series. Cool thing about Star Trek was that although they explored new worlds ""physically,"" in reality it was more of an inner journey that was projected as physical manifestations (just like the great Twilight Zone series), which made you think a little bit more. It also made the cheesy f/x charming, because those things became irrelevant. And, Captain Kirk, what a character! Spock, what a square! (in a good way) Mc Coy was a like a grumpy, emotional grandma, but a ton of fun! Admittedly, much of the movies that came out of it were more about the dogfights than exploring, however. Despite the fact that people do make fun of the first motion picture, I appreciated it simply for the fact that they actually tried to ""seek out new civilizations.""Yes, going back to the movie at hand. I loved the fact they got an unknown and not Matt Damon as Captain Kirk. Yea, Matt Damon might as well have been a great choice... but it would just be Matt Damon playing himself. His personality in movies are already too much like Captain Kirk. He's too likable, gets the chicks, and can beat up everybody. I'm sure no one minded Pierce Brosnan becoming James Bond in Goldeneye or Jack Nicholson become the Joker in Bat Man as they were already ""perfect"" for that role, but seeing Heath ""Brokeback Mountain"" Ledger becoming the Joker? Unheard of! Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the first X-men? Hugh who? A blonde Daniel Craig as Bond? What? Just to clarify, these untested unknowns have now ""become"" these beloved characters to the fanboys. Simply put, these actors had to ""try harder"" to get over all the hoops and suspicions of the audience and wound up with something better, more original, and daring. While Chris Pine as Kirk wasn't some great breakthrough role, I appreciated the fact that he wound up as far from being any parody or a caricature (Let's face it--how can you NOT make a caricature of Captain Kirk? Everybody....else and...their grandmother....has). True, Karl Urban, being spot-on perfect as Mc Coy ALMOST treaded the line toward caricature, but he was so excellent at it, it was a tear-jerking homage more than anything. Zachary ""Sylar"" Quinto as Spock--he brought dimension to what could've otherwise have been a flat character in the wrong hands. I generally dislike most portrayals of Vulcans in Star Trek--Leonard Nimoy as Spock was probably the only Vulcan that I liked. I LIKED Sylar's Spock. There was actual inner struggle in this version of Spock, which can be both good and bad, but it makes sense...I'll merely say: ""Facinating."" Anton Yelchin's Russian accent as Chekov, however...well.... I didn't mind. Wasn't Chekov already kind of like a stereotype? Haha. I dunno. I still liked him. Hey, it was the Cold War back then--having a Russian in a USS starfleet was quite an accomplishment in itself. There were also small and major details I did love. One was a scene where Spock beams down on a planet while crouching. This kind of detail made perfect sense especially assuming that most planetary (or rocky) surfaces are usually not level. Another great treat, a major one, was that there was actually a scene where James Kirk takes the Kobayashi Maru test, which was mentioned before (or would that be late?) in the best (and still best) film of the series, Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.Admittedly, much like the other movies of the series, the new Star Trek film doesn't ""seek out new civilizations"" either. However, given the fact that it's more about the introduction of the characters and their quirks and what they're capable of and how they came to be where they are, I can let that fact go (for now). It may simply be better that they ""seek out"" in the next movie instead (which hopefully won't be about dogfights but actual exploration). It's sometimes just hard to fit everything in. Even movies like Spider-Man and Batman Begins, where the main character goes through a journey from ordinary to extraordinary, one wonders if it's so important to have a major baddie in the first film given that the bad guy will always lose screen time to the main guy. In the case of this movie, where there are lots of main characters, this discrepancy may be quite noticeable, even though I think Eric Bana as the Romulan baddie Nero handled it perfectly well and I have no real complaints on that regard. After all, thanks to time travel (one of the central parts of my aforementioned nitpick), the bad guy appears to the good guys ready-made and angry, ready for consumption (to become cannon fodder) like an instant TV dinner. I wonder if they have a ""bad-guy replicator"" in the future? Nitpicks aside, the action is aplenty, the special effects are excellent, the characters are lovable, and you want to see them win (a good sign) and well, what do you expect? Overall, a very good film: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bringing Sci-fi back to life,"Long ago I used to watch Star Trek on TV and in the movies, but lost all interest many years ago. Yet just from the trailers I knew this movie would not be anything like before. It was all and more than I had anticipated, and from the very first moments I was at the edge of my seat, with goosebumps from the sheer enormity of the opening sequence.It's been a while since I've seen a good sci-fi movie and it has always been one of my favourite genres as there is so much potential when done right. Star Trek had it all right and then some and will hopefully spark new interest in the genre.The way the cast is brought together is brilliant, with a twist that allows for a whole new vantage point from which the franchise can move forward and now I can't wait for what's next and in the mean time intend to go back to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The character casting and well thought plot will make this a great hit!,"I was very lucky to be able to see the pre-screen for this movie on Monday at the AMC Studio 30 and I am still in complete awe of how great of a movie this is! I will not go into a lot of details, as I hate spoilers, just the basic comments. First, they were spot on with all the casting, these ""new"" faces do an excellent job to honor the original cast. My personal favorite is the new Bones. The plot is a little confusing in the beginning, but the suspense is rewarding as the storyline opens. Some of the fight scenes are a little too fast, and I would suggest sitting far enough away from the screen to adjust for this. There were moments in the theater when the whole audience clapped and laughed, and I don't think anyone walked away disappointed in any respect. I was fortunate enough to be sitting with two older gentlemen who were 1st generation Trekkies, and even they were overjoyed with the movie. The best thing about this movie is that you don't have to be a hardcore Star Trek fan, or even a big fan of sci-fi to be able to appreciate this movie. I don't see how anyone could come out of it with a bad experience.

"Boldly going forward, but not by much.","The review for Star trek have been very good, so I went into the film with high hopes. Unfortunately I must say that I was disappointed and thought the film was no better than average.The film has lots of action and does try and a interesting plot idea but over all it but the script is a bit ham fisted, clumsy and pretty predictable. Most of the acting is good and none of the characters is unlikeable. The two characters that shine for me are Bruce Greenwood who plays Captain Pike extremely well and Zoe Saldana who is great a Uhura. Zachary Quinto is quite good as Spock and Chris Pine is fine as Kirk though he seems to lack the personality of William Shatner. The one annoying character for me is Simon Pegg as Scotty, he just is so over the top that it gets annoying and his character seems to be being played for laughs. I liked Eric Banner as the bad guy Nero, he doesn't come over as the normal bad guy. He under plays the character and comes over as just a average guy but with a extremely powerful weapon.I cannot say I am a fan of the JJ Abrams direction, he uses a lot of hand held jerky camera work which is annoying at time. I also got very annoyed with the action scenes, especially the space battles. There is just to much going and crowded. This isn't helped by the fast editing and the cinematography which had lots of close ups just was frustrating. I must admit that the special effects were of a very high quality which shows that by giving a film enough time to get certain things right, it can improve the film greatly.I have to say one of the weakest elements of the film is the music, the score is weak especially when compared some of the great Star Trek films scores. It completely fails to add to the film and is a huge let down. I thought the set design was OK I got annoyed by a couple of things and the bridge of the Enterprise looked like it had been designed by Macintosh. Which brings me to another really annoy and rather silly thing thing in the film. Product placement just doesn't work well in far future science fiction films and looks completely out of place in a Star Trek film. I just found it irritating and completely out of place.I have done a lot of moaning about the film and there is a lot of negative things to say about the film but the film is not terrible. I found it to be generally harmless and some times funny but with a lot of annoying little bits which reduced what I thought could have been a great film. I am glad Star Trek is back and hopefully the sequels will be really good.

"Wow, a fantastic twist to make a fresh start","I have been a fan of the Star Trek series from the mid seventies, when the original series went into syndication in NYC. I have always been intrigued by the possibilities of the story and have been disappointed by the latest versions of TV series that seem to be running in mud trying to engage the audience and struggling to adhere to the genre's story arc.This movie is a breath of fresh air. It successfully detaches from the genre's arc yet is absolutely true to the original characters. The movie grabs you from the first moment of the film and doesn't let go until the end. I would suggest you hit the rest room before it starts, because there was no obvious slow portion of the film that you could safely miss. The character development of the original cast is so tightly woven into the story line that they are not side stories, but the character development accelerates the whole story.This movie is one of the few I would recommend to actually take the time to see in a theater. The scenes and score are amazingly matched and the big screen really helps pull the viewer into the story.There are moments in the movie to cheer and moments to cry.

Making Myths of the Mundane,"'Star Trek' is boring. From the first series through to the last chapter in the saga. It is dialogue heavy, it refers to itself, there are published manuals on the technical rules and regulations of the Federation. It is about heroes who are paid to be just that. You are watching Kirk do his job, Spock do his job. Picard doing his job. It is about chores and was invariably a diversion or a chore to watch.'Star Wars' is myth, fantasy - Perseus with lazer swords, King ARthur with hovering landspeeders and weird creatures.This is why J.J. Abrams can be accused of cheating. He has attempted to place the Arthur story, the Hero's Journey, onto Kirk and the Enterprise, revisionist storytelling that should be as offensive to 'Star Trek' fans as it is to 'Star Wars' fans.The new film is damned exciting in places, but Eric Bana's brooding rogue Romulan could have been lifted from 'Star Trek: Nemesis'. Spock was never as petulant as Skywalker, Kirk was never as cool as Han - so the new producers and directors have cheated and grafted those personas onto them. Uhura is Leia, Old Spock is Yoda/Ben Kenobi and the chop-n-shoot style of seventies' Lucas is imported. Even the scramble for the shuttles is straight out of 'Jedi'.You can't cheat - 'Star Trek' fans, you all know Trek is not and should not be as engaging as this - Abrams has ripped up your classic characters and started again so he can make this appeal - which should also offend. 'Star Wars' fans, by turns, should accept not this pretender to the throne. Abrams should have made his own space epic and he was a fool not to.If Karl Urban is not at least nominated for a Best Supporting actor Oscar, however, I am never watching the Academy Awards again.

Phenomenal. A must see!!,"I have read some of the comments by the 'hated it' brigade and I would like to say 'Get a life'. This wasn't a documentary intended to be shown on Discovery Science.

On our way home, my daughter and I couldn't stop discussing the film, the actors, the effects. Sadly I am old enough to remember watching the original series and I agree there may be plot holes when you compare it with the original series or the other films, but for God's sake, is it not possible for some of you to sit and watch a movie and just enjoy it as a stand alone film for its own sake? To the open minded, this is an absolutely brilliant film which passes all to quickly and will be a must for my Blue Ray collection when the time comes. Go out, leave your Trekkie brain at the door and watch this with a smile on your face. It wont leave you very often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New Star Trek is awesome,"I'm just astonished by the incredible number of negative comments being posted on here by ""hard core"" Star Trek fans blasting this fantastic epic movie with all the insane drooling hate filled babble that only they can muster. I've been a Star Trek fan since I was five years old and I think this movie was fantastic. You Star Trek fans out there decrying this movie for it's lack of political, philosophical and sociological commentary are every bit the dickheads that Leonard Nimoy called you on Saturday Night Live. You just cant deal emotionally with the fact that this movie is actually just as exiting and thrilling as Star Trek's greatest rival which of course has been Star Wars. In case you unrepentant nerds didn't notice Star Wars has always pretty much been considered mainstream entertainment while Star Trek pretty much has NOT. This is in spite of the great rating for TNG, DS9 and Voyager. Quite frankly, all you so called fans out there who hate this movie just because it has more excitement that your wussy souls can deal with are mostly just a bunch of nerdy losers just like Shatner made your out to be on SNL. Why don't get down off your sickening left wing high horse and just become normal human beings for once and you might actually be able to chill out enjoy this movie. You only know how to make yourself feel intellectually superior to others by emotionally puffing yourself up all the time with things that are filled with endless philosophical and sociological dribble drabble. The famous Star Trek technobabble, I'm sad to say, has also often served this same purpose because it makes you feel falsely like your somehow ""smarter"" than everyone else when in fact it doesn't teach your a damm thing that even really matters. Personally I'm happy that J.J. Abrams in this movie not only ditched the technobabble but ditched all of the other sociological dribble drabble as well. This isn't the 1960's anymore. If your want something with sixties like sociological perspective then watch the original series again until your blue in the face. Just leave the rest of us alone who just want Paramount to do whatever it takes to save the Star Trek franchise and who just love watching really great entertainment like this. This movie was as close to the original vision from the 1960's as your can get while still being updated for the 21st century. For Christ's sake it even still has mini-skirts in it and a whole ton of other tidbits right out of the original series and that still isn't good enough for some of you people who would still prefer that the Enterprise sets still be made out of cardboard. In fact, only real nerds would make some of the insane comments I've seen on here including a comment by one idiot claiming to be a fan and yet saying at the same time that he hoped that this film would bomb and not make any money. In case this one particular moron didn't notice Star Trek has had a VERY hard time for 40 years being considered any type of mainstream entertainment. We just couldn't afford another bomb out like Star Trek: Nemesis just so all of your ""hard core"" fans who want to stay stuck in the 1960's could still remain in your pathetic little nerdy left wing world. That's a world where the only ""good"" Star Trek is supposed to be something that resembles a political science class with an arrogant left wing, socialist/secular humanist professor who keeps babbling on forever until you cave in at last and are ready to take a copy of Das Kapital in hand and start you own new red revolution. The Next Generation had enough of that type of left wing anti-capitalist garbage and thank god it was all left out of this awesome and enjoyable re-boot. Thank you J.J Abrams for not cow-towing to all of Star Trek's wonderfully loyal ""hard core"" fans who apparently would have been happier if this movie had bombed out by being filled with two hours of boring sociological and political commentary instead of something exiting and thrilling for a change!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Casual fan now in love,"I will try not to spoil anything with my simple opinion. This is from of one who has grown up watching the show and most of the movies.First of all it is more than just the flashiness. It is a very beautiful movie but the only time I remember ever thinking about is during the middle action sequence.Three things that made the movie for me: the acting, the humor, and the plot.Acting- The acting was spot on. Karl Urban as Bones was so much like Kelly (the original doctor) that I remember everyone laughing in the theater just because he was so good. Quinto as Spock was a very good casting choice, though he can't beat good old Nimoy. Pine was equally good but never really felt like Kirk until the third act, but that was explained in the movie. As for everyone else, not one person was underused or wrong for the part.Humor- One of the best things in this movie. The fast plot it broken up by lots of humor. Some people may not like the slapstick, but, as one who usually doesn't like it, I laughed at all of it. Simon Pegg was great as Scotty, bringing in a little joy just like the show.Plot- The most important part to a movie was nailed. It isn't perfect but I loved it too much to care. I didn't understand the love between Uhura and Spock. Nero, the villain, should have been developed a little more; I still like him as a villain however. You will find it takes from the second Star Trek movie a lot, which I find a good thing. It also takes from Star Wars a lot. For example there is the theme of destiny and coming-of-age which was never in regular Star Trek. There are a lot of heavy themes in this movie such as friendship, revenge, the value of being human, and hope in darkness; all Star Trek themes I have grown up loving. Best of all you see Kirk and Spock grow. Plus, Nimoy had an important narrative role.I hope this review is helpful, and I hope this movie will make you love the series as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I've Seen 'Em All And I Am Amazed,"I have seen all the TV shows, I have watched all the movies, read all the books and comics. I Love Star Trek. I always have. Only been to one convention in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This movie was, without a doubt, one of the best things I have seen on the screen in a long time, if not ever. It had all the aspects of Star Trek that I needed, and all the aspects of a great Sci-fi Action Movie that I require. The humor was spot on, the characters portrayed brilliantly in my mind. To tell the truth, from the moment I heard they were going to remake this movie, I was a little nervous. But I didn't need to be, because this was a masterpiece. (SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW) Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those Trek fans who needs to nit-pick every little plot point for the sake of continuity. I never have been. After reading the message boards for this movie on here, some ""Trekkies"" seem to have a big problem with this alternate time-line. I personally do not have a problem with it at all. I also think that it makes perfect sense to do what they did, in changing the time-line. This way, for future sequels, they are not tied to Star Trek canon. The movies can now be surprising and different, without ""Trekkies"" whining that they can't do that, cause it didn't happen that way. All the whining about Vulcan being destroyed is moot as well. They didn't kill off the Vulcans, as Spock said in the movie, there are at least 10,000 of them left, and the original Spock said at the end they were going to set up a new Vulcan colony on a new planet. Also with all of the emotions that the new Spock showed in this movie, I truly think they were just coming to grips with the character and I doubt that he will be exuding as much emotion in the sequels. Spock's logic and emotional control are what define him. Also, the scenes between the original Spock and Kirk on the frozen planet were touching and sensitive in a way only Leonard Nimoy could have done. I was almost brought to tears when he told Kirk ""I have been and always shall be, your friend"" Of course I'm also the guy who was brought to tears by seeing Admiral McCoy talking to Data on the first episode of The Next Generation. So now I guess I am just rambling. In conclusion, and as I probably already said, this movie is at the top of my list for favorite movies of all time. I was on the edge of my seat with excitement throughout, laughing at the wonderful lines by the new people people playing characters I have revered for a lifetime. If I had a criticism for this movie, it would only be that I didn't want it to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What works what doesn't.,"This re-boot of the visionary franchise is a worthy movie-going experience. Many elements are above-average: the production design, the sets, the special effects, the musical score, the direction, the new fleet uniforms, most of the writing, and the casting. Well, almost all of the casting choices. There is the one exception that ruins it for me. I'm certain the actor is very talented and disciplined at his craft. It's just that every time the actor playing Leonard 'Bones' McCoy comes on screen the film takes a left turn as if his scenes are skits from Saturday Night Live. His performance of McCoy is a parody at best and if it's meant to honor DeForest Kelley well it misfired.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
