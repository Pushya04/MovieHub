Revenge of the 80's: The Franchise,"Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it.The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself?A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already).Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The best sequel ever made,"Continuing a movie as perfect as ""Back To The Future"" must have been a really tough job. What made it even harder was that the writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had to ignore an important character from part one. Because Crispin Glover asked for too much money, his character George McFly, Marty's wacky Dad, hardly appears in the sequels, which constricted the storyline a lot beforehand.Still, ""Back To The Future II"" turned out to be a huge success, commercially and artistically. The movie is every bit as clever and delightful as part one. I think most viewers don't realize how extremely complex this story is, because it's so enjoyable to watch. Gale & Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don't think that has ever been done before or since.No, the movie isn't flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn't be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). ""Mistakes"" like that don't take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did.Besides the perfect script the trilogy's success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It's a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn't return for the sequels, but as I've said before, Gale & Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn't come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here.Summing up, ""Back To The Future II"" is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it's the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". But that's a different story...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Part 2-The Cubs won the World Series?!,"I'm one lucky girl, I rented all three Back to the Future films, so I could watch them all in a row, I didn't have to wait year after year, well I was kinda born in 1985, so it's all good. But anyways, I just saw the Back to the Future trilogy tonite and after it seeming like I was the only person who didn't see these movies, I did it! Part two was a very good sequel, while it isn't quite up to par with the first Back to the Future, it was cool, it was kinda like Deja Vu with a different story that worked.Marty and Jennifer start off where the first left off, Doc takes them to the year 2015(which is funny that it is only 8 years away), and Doc tells Marty to fix a situation with his future son. Biff overhears an idea later brought up to Doc about possibly giving himself tips to win big money for the future as soon as they go back, but Doc talks him out of it, but Biff has different plans and takes the book and the De Lauren and goes back to 1955 and makes himself the richest man alive in 1985, so Marty and The Doc must go back and alter the future back to it's old ways.Part two is definitely worth a look for those Back to the Future fans, not to mention, it's just good to see where these stories go. Like I said, it's not as good as the first, but it is a good movie and actually a little better than a 7.1, if you ask me. But that's just me, so just give this movie a chance, you just might find yourself enjoying it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Solid sequel in ""Back to the Future"" trilogy dosen't deserve the hate my favorite time travel movie","Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car ""DeLorean"" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love ""Back to the Future"" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray.Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint.Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with ""DeLorean"" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird.This film get's 8 ""Back to the Future"" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Excess with good reason, good skill, and great results!","Marty McFly is back, and this time he has to travel back to 1955 after an unfortunate incident which took place in 2015 so that he can prevent the destruction of the peaceful society of Hill Valley (what a great fictional name!). The film provides two hours of absolutely wonderful and fun entertainment.Every paradox and logical problem of time-travel is explained very well in the film itself, and those that are left out are easily overlooked due to the creativeness of the rest of the film. Who cares that if Marty leaves 1985 in a time machine to 2015, there would be no Marty left in 1985 to grow to up into the 47 year old Marty in 2015? This movie is so much fun that things like this are gladly forgotten about in order to accept the huge amount of satisfaction delivered by the film.The Back To The Future trilogy is a perfect example of the need to be willing to abandon at least a tiny bit of logic in order to fully enjoy a movie. This suspension of disbelief is necessary for a person to be able to truly experience the effectiveness of all three Back To The Future films, and this experience truly is a great one.It is so rare that a film or a series of films comes along that is so well written and perfectly acted and directed as the Back To The Future movies are. Although I realize that another sequel would probably be disastrous to the credibility of the series as a whole, I have to admit that I have always been disappointed that they stopped at the third film. All three are so much fun that they leave you wishing that the story left room for a few more sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Best time travel adventure!,"As a huge BTTF fan, I have to admit that this is the best BTTF flick ever made. It has all the ingredients to please all audience of any age. I personally like the 50's stuff in it, but I am also a huge 80's fan (the present in the movie) and the future is just hilarious. Of course...it has been almost two decades since this movie came out, and now we know that the future that is shown in BTTF 2 is a bit funny, but hey...do you remember Total Recall? Now THAT is also a future that would never see daylight, but at least the BTTF 2 future is amusing.I have seen this movie over a dozen times, and I tried to find things that don't match, movie mistakes etc. (yes..I am a pain in the ..)but the thing is, I KNOW that there are mistakes (like reflections in window glass) but this movie keeps your mind drifting away, enchanted by the great story and great moments. Of course Spielberg never intended to have more ingredients then the past (50's), the present and the future. But almost 20 years later...it is also a (another) great movie to see what the 80's were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70's)I recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can't watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence.Have fun!

"From the present, to the future, back to the present, then back to the past.  One great ride!","When Back to The Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break.  They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels.  The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel.  What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless.For part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film.  The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffrey Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer.  George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future)so neither casting change is of any consequence.The original film dealt with how Marty had threatened his own existence because of changes he had accidentally initiated in the year 1955.  For Part II, we learn what happens when the interference is of a much larger scale and consequence. As you recall, the original film ended with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)whisking Marty (Michael J. Fox)and Jennifer away with him to the year 2015 to straighten out their kids.  For all his harping about messing with historical events, Doc is not above initiating a bit of interference himself.  In their attempt to rescue Marty's future offspring, an aged but still obnoxious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), steals the Delorean to transport himself into the past and to bestow upon himself a Sports Almanac book that contains the results of sporting events for years to come.  Shortly thereafter, Doc and Marty return to 1985, only to find that not only is Hill Valley not what it used to be, their own lives are in pretty sad shape and far different than what they had been before.  And the changes aren't good ones, or as Doc puts it ""I can't imagine Hell being much worse.""What makes the Back To The Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imaginations run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train.  Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it.  There are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dustbusters and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. etc.  Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley.  Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this case its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it.  It works perfectly.Likewise, the alternative version of 1985 Hill Valley is an exercise in how far one's imagination can go.  Instead of a quaint peaceful town and suburbs, Zemeckis and Gale do everything in their power to give us the equivalent of an opposite. To go into too much detail here would undermine your own viewing experience and give away a bit too much of the plot.Then to add fuel to the fire, we once again revisit Hill Valley in 1955, where things really go berserk what with two Marty's and two Docs inhabiting the same year.  Zemeckis does a great job of cutting new scenes into footage from the original film with different angles and different perspectives of previous seen activities.As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertaining level as before.  Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future.  He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much.  Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine Mcfly to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably.  Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done.  As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy.Some have complained about being able to follow Zemeckis and Gale's storyline.  If you have seen the first film, you'll have no trouble in that regard.  I sure didn't, and for me it was one heck of a comedic thrill ride from beginning to end.  If you don't have fun watching Back To The Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015.  It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Middling sequel, although I liked it the first time I saw it","I recall liking this pretty well when I saw it a quarter of a century ago, but this time, watching it on the heels of watching the original Back to the Future, I was pretty disappointed.The sequel has several notable differences from the original. For one thing, it's much more sci-fi-ish. The first movie took a sci-fi principle and built around it a movie whose charm was based on human interaction. The sequel is a bit more interested in it's sci-fi elements, and a little less interested in people.But the real problem is that this movie is much less well constructed than the original. In BTTF, everything is neatly set up. Everything that happens flows logically from a previous event. But BTTF2 is much more of a mishmosh, with a rambling story and loose threads. Even the way the movie begins is antithetical to the first one. The first time around, Doc is keenly aware of the dangers of fooling with history; in this movie, he chooses to change things around.It's also also just not nearly as funny as the first one.BTTF2 picks up towards the end. The last half hour or so has Marty returning to the scenes of the original movie, and it's cute to see the way he has to change events without letting the first time traveling Marty see him.It is in fact references to the first movie that are the best part of the second. Which just proves how good the first one was, and how idea- poor the sequel is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great Scott! Even the Doc Doesn't Take His Own Advice! (spoilers),"It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years).The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985.This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment.But, it also ties in another creative aspect: when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty ""Calvin Klein"" McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015?So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success: the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Uneven but Fascinating,"I am conflicted on this one. Naturally, it is the sequel to the most popular film of nineteen eighty-five, and one of my favorite films of all time, Back to the Future. They did not expect the film to become a hit, but when it did, the studio took no time telling them to make a sequel. And so we got this film. The creators have gone on record stating that the 'To Be Continued' at the end of movie one was not supposed to relate to anything, and that if they knew that they were going to be making a sequel, they would have ended it differently.The lack of desire to make this movie in particular shows. A lot. It is disjointed, filled with plot holes, pandering, and altogether does not work as a film that can be enjoyed completely seriously. I do like this film, but I like it in the same way that I like another ridiculous sequel to one of my favorite films of all time: Rocky IV. Both films are memorable and ingrained in the public consciousness, but decidedly not what a film critic would consider good.But why? What goes wrong here. Let's take a look at the plot. Marty McFly, the seventeen year-old icon of the 80s himself, goes with his girlfriend Jennifer (played by a different actress and sorely underused in this film) and crazy but awesome (seriously, the man made a time machine) scientist, Doc Brown to the future. What's the year, you may ask if you were living under a rock about a month and a half ago. 2015.I could go into how this movie's description of 2015 compares with the real 2015, but I went into that specifically on a post on my website that I wrote on BTTF Day. Suffice it to say that it is pretty cool in the retro future kind of way, the same way that steampunk and cyberpunk is cool. This is, strangely enough, the weakest section of the movie by far. There are some funny gags, but everything else falls flat.The second third takes us to an alternate 1985. I won't spoil anything (though if you haven't seen this film... shame on you), but suffice it to say that things are not pretty. It lacks the grand dystopian vision of something like Blade Runner, but there is a texture to the atmosphere that I really appreciate. And... I prefer to not get too political, but can we all just agree that the terrifying Alt1985 Biff is Donald Trump.The last third takes us back to 1955. This is both the worse and the best part of the movie. There are a lot of rehash gags here, and it comes dangerously close to completely retreading the plot of movie 1, and it drags on way too long, but the tension is thicker than in any other part, and the last fifteen minutes of the film is one of, if not the best sections of any of these films.There are a lot of parts that are just lame, plain and simple. But I don't feel embarrassment but disappointment. Of all the movies, this one covers the most ground, has the most ambition and imagination, and overall material to make a great film. But whereas the first one did everything right, this film squanders a lot of opportunities. The magic is gone. I wish I could say that it's a great film, but it's just an average one, and my least favorite of the BTTF trilogy.(Still, it is pretty cool how they were able to throw in a couple references to BTTF 3 due to shooting both sequels at the same time.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Disappointing,"Marty and Doc travel into the future to solve some problems, travel back to 1985 only to encounter more problems and the only way to solve those problems is to go back to 1955.Overly complicated and pretentious sequel to the classic original. The futuristic sequences seem silly and overblown and the 1985 reality is so bleak and uninteresting with cheap humor. It's only in the final third, when they go back to 1955, that the film comes to life for an exciting finale.Zemeckis drowns the film in special effects, has some sort of compulsion to have all the characters meet their other selves and really stretches every bit of credibility to the point of absurdity (the tunnel scene not only unsuspenseful and unconvincing but badly edited). The film somehow feels rushed, not made with a whole lot of passion, even the cast somehow seem disinterested. Thomas F. Wilson however gives another great performance in no less than three roles and is by far the best of the bunch this time around.Back to the Future Part II is not boring, but in comparison to the first rate original it comes as a sore disappointment. Fortunately they made Part III and finished off on a high note.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part II exhausts its fusion energy on an overstuffed and convoluted plot.,"Warning: unpopular opinion alert. Having just watched the sequel to the brilliantly energetic Back to the Future for the first time, whilst having a moment of reflection as I imagine myself riding a hoverboard with a pair of Nike MAGs equipped, I arrived at my conclusive destination. No time travelling back and forth between alternate timelines needed. And as much as you probably do not want to hear this, honesty is the best policy. With that, I can confidently confess that Back to the Future Part II is aggressively average. A sequel riddled in so much mediocrity, that I'm dumbfounded as to how it has received such unanimous praise from audiences. Immediately after the events from its predecessor, Doc and Marty travel to the future to prevent his son from sabotaging their family's future.However in doing so, future Biff uses Doc's time machine for his own devious benefit and timelines become more skewed than Glover's non-existent involvement (glad he won the lawsuit). Gale returns as the primary writer, and in the short space of time between this sequel and the original, he had seemingly forgotten how to write a decent character driven plot. The story is solely focused on the mechanisms of time travel, by dabbling into several different points in time, that Gale outwardly throws in as many paradoxical plot points as possible. The present, the future, the past, an alternate present. So much story was crammed into the plot, that he had inadvertently relinquished the heartwarming emotional family drama that made the original tantalisingly refreshing.Literally, take the first hour of this film and use it as fusion energy. It's a complete re-hash. Copying the same events from 1955 and adapting them to futuristic technologies found in this now awkward dystopian 2015 (if only we had flying cars...), may generate callback humour. But consequently makes the entire set piece monotonously dull. Zip back to 1955, adjacent to the previous film's timeline, and again it's just an identical narrative structure. This time substituting the emotional core resonance between Marty's mother and father for a simplistic yet elongated chase sequence for a sports almanac. This would be all swell if Zemeckis could actually focus on one sub-plot at a time. The constant shifting between present Marty chasing Biff whilst avoiding past Marty and past parents, Doc floating around aimlessly in the DeLorean and Jennifer...wait, what even happened to her? Talk about discarding the one and only female character almost immediately!Essentially, the pacing was diabolically uneven. The only hint of originality was with the alternate present timeline and that whole sequence was instantly forgettable. Had it been more emotionally impactful on Marty, then perhaps I would think differently. Unfortunately he shrugs it off and consistently yells ""Doc!"" whenever he has a minute not chasing someone.Atleast Gale remedied my existing criticism with the first film by giving Biff some much needed character development. His antagonistic motives actually provided sufficient fuel for Doc and Marty. Lloyd offered another perfect performance as Doc, and Fox was slightly more underwhelming than his previous iteration, but that's down to the robotic script which provided more opportunities for visual spectacle. And yes, the visuals still hold up well today (minus Glover not Glover floating upside down...). But to waste a total of five minutes by replicating the ending to the original (shot-for-shot) and spewing a teaser trailer for Part III, was futile.In all seriousness, I'm shrouded in disappointment. From all the ""woops"" and ""cheers"" that this trilogy has received over time, I would've anticipated a solid sequel. Alas, the uneven overstuffed plot slowed the pace down to a staggeringly moderate 30mph, not nearly enough motivation for me to travel back in time and watch this again in a hurry.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The Travelling Through Time Continues,"'Back to the Future Part II' takes off where the first movie left. Pretty much the essence of the first one is present except this time Elisabeth Shue has been cast as Marty's girlfriend. Like the first movie, this one too is non-stop fun. The original plot once again, brilliantly revolves around the time-travelling paradox but this time the interference with the time-line has huger repercussions that are more complicated to solve. It's slightly a little more complex than the first movie but the energy and entertainment level is the same. I liked Zemeckis's version of 2015. It has that ultracool look and the futuristic gadgets and gizmos were quite amusing. The soundtrack is equally wild. The camera-work and special effects are very well done considering that the challenge was greater (e.g. showing two Michael J. Fox on the same screen). Okay, so showing the same actor share the screen with himself isn't anything new but in most movies/shows it looks poorly done which is not the case here. With most movies, the sequel tends to be a let down but 'Back to the Future Part II' is a great continuation of the first film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future - the only '80s movie that's completely...timeless!,"I love the original movie, so don't get me wrong, but I have a special thing for really cool looking futuristic things. Especially if they're made out to look really interesting like in this sequel.The story is still very good, the characters are still lovable and have some great lines, and the ending is superb even if it leaves you wanting for a little more. Interchanging between this movie and the last (even the next) were great twists and turns, probably still the best achievement i've seen properly executed in a film to date.While the original is probably an eleven on my scale now, this one used to be my all time favorite one in the BTTF trilogy. And there's still a whole lot to love about this movie, even the kids today will probably appreciate how much fun this movie is even with all the flash and more advanced CG effects they have in their movies today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Its finally 2015, and we have a fun sequel!","Picking up where the first one left off, Doc takes Marty for an adventure as they travel to the future 2015 as they take care some business; while that is going on, Marty's nemesis Biff steals the time machine by giving the sports almanac that Marty bought to his younger self as he creates an alternate dimension. So its up to Doc and Marty to stop Biff for letting this all happening as they try to fix time. The year is finally 2015, and the 2015 we have today is nothing like what the movie looked. Of course, I have look up many news and videos as they try to create shoes that laces themselves, and creating hover-boards that float. No the Cubs did not win the World Series, but we came so close to make that predictability a reality. So anyway, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is a fun sequel to watch, but not as good as the first. I thought Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Lloyd are still great together, while Lea Thompson and the rest of the cast all did great. Of course, I have to mention Thomas F. Wilson who is really good for playing a bad guy like the character he played in all three movies. The look of 2015 is really well done, which it doesn't go into the same style like what ""Blade Runner"" looked. The movie does have its exciting moments, and you are always rooting for Marty and Doc as they try to save time. The special effects by ILM are really good, while some seem slightly dated. The movie is also funny too, so nothing much that I can say about. Alan Silvestri's music is also really good too along side with the story. I do wish if the opening scene wasn't re-shot, but Claudia Wells was unable to due to what is happening with her family; its understandable but can't complain about that. However, I do wish if Crispin Glover was in this movie but he ends up not to due to what his reasons were as he needed more money, and not appreciating how the first one ended. I do disagree with his thoughts on the ending, and I still wish if he was in this movie. So with that said, I enjoy ""Back to Future Part II,"" and I am sure that you will have a fun time with this one. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great Scott - this is Heavy,"Back to the Future 2 is a brilliant sequel, for its incredible futuristic special effects made this film into a Classic Time Travel movie. There was a period, however, when the entire film went stagnant and downhill, but did pick-up again as the film went on. Up until the part when Marty McFly(Micheal J. Fox) returned to the alternate(Biff ruled) 1985 for when Marty got hit over the head by Biffs goons infront of the Clocktower/Biffs Casino Hotel this film was spectacular, but thereafter that scene, this film endlessly dragged-on.In time this film did pick-up again when Marty McFly went back in time to the year 1955 to retrieve the Sports Almanac that Old Biff gave to young Biff, for that spiced up the film again. Even though I very much enjoyed this film, I did find that there were loads of contradictions in it that didn't make sense. The scene when Old Biff travelled back in time from the year 2015 to the year 1955 to give the Sports Almanac to himself (so he can win money on horse racing by knowing the winning results ahead of time) and then returned to the year 2015 didn't quite match up. This is because when Old Biff travelled back in time to the year 1955 giving himself(Young Biff) the Sports Almanac so he could become rich, he did in fact change history. This means that when he returned to the year 2015 it should have been the new alternate(Biff ruled) 2015, but it wasn't, for it was the same normal 2015 that he departed from.Another scene is when Marty and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) went back home to the year 1985 after fixing Martys family problems in the year 2015, didn't make proper sense either because seeing how old Biff changed history, that prevented Marty and Doc Brown from ever meeting one another and even Doc Brown from inventing the Time machine. This doesn't match up either - for this would have caused a time travel paradox that Doc Brown often speaks about, which would have ceased their existences to time as they knew it, and their souls would have been redeemed into the new alternate(1985) existences, for Marty would have become the new Marty that lives in a boarding school in Switzerland and Doc Brown would have been redeemed into the life of the alternate existence of being committed into a mental Institution, but it didn't happen that way. Instead, there were two Doc Browns and two Marty McFlys living in the same year and from different parallel universes/ time vessels - and many other examples of contradiction that just go on and on. Mind you, this film is a Comedy/Sci-fi and seeing as time travel is a fantasy subject, a person really can't take these contradictions seriously, for this film 'Back to the Future/ Part 2'(and other time travel movies) are about enjoying yourself and having a laugh. Despite this films contradictions which aren't a big deal anyway, i'd recommend anybody to watch this movie for the acting was good, especially Thomas Wilson(Biff/Griff Tannen) who performed a fantastic acting job, the special effects/background was amazing along with its great lighting and colour co-ordination and most of all the storyline was good. However, this film didn't have the most original storyline as this films storyline was copied from the film 'Its a wonderful life' but don't let that put you off watching the film 'Back to the future/Part 2' for the film 'Its a wonderful life' was a beautiful movie with a great storyline with a great plot and moral.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
In the middle,"I think that this film belongs in the middle of the trilogy not only in chronological order, but in good order as well.  This film is better than part 3 because it has some funny gags in deja vu fashion, and not as good as part 1 because of a few flaws.  Story continues exactly from part 1 and has Marty and Doc going 30 years into the future to find that there is a new generation of McFly's but it gets complicated after that (and even more than the first).  Plenty of laughs, but consistency is somewhat missing (in part 1, Claudia Wells played Jennifer and in this part, Elizabeth Shue plays her and messes up the flow).

"Much like its predecessor, Back To The Future II has successfully stood the test of time!","In honor of Back To The Future Day, I decided to write my review on a movie that is not only has a historic background, but also happens to be a good movie. Although it has been a while since I've seen the first two Back To The Future Movies, from as early as I can remember, I always favored Part II. Although much of this favoritism has to do with its overly futuristic depiction of 2015, I still find myself to be drawn to the sequel that introduced more comedy, character development, and most importantly, built upon the framework established in the first movie. Then of course there's the classic hover-board scene, which to this day still amazes me. Above all, the biggest reason why I continue to be amazed by Back To The Future II is because of the nostalgia it evokes from viewers both young and old. We are in that time frame where both parents and their children are familiar with the Back To the Future movies, and it just amazes me to think that it was only 30 years ago that my parents were heading to the movies to see Back To The Future, and were around the same age as I am know. It was only 30 years ago when they envisioned a world filled with flying cars, even wackier clothes, and HOVER-BOARDS. Now I am growing up in that time frame that they always dreamed about, and I am experiencing technology that at one time seemed like science fiction to them. I don't know about you, but I think that's pretty awesome!! Happy Back To The Future Day!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
2 part was originally supposed to surpass the famous original,"2 part was originally supposed to surpass the famous original. But unfortunately, in almost everything it is inferior to the original. The idea is no longer new, the characters are still the same and they do the same actions. As a result, all this looks with a sense of old living.

Too Much 'Biff' Makes It The Weakest Of The 3 BTTFs,"This was the only one of the three ""Back To The Future"" movies I did not enjoy watching, even when I loved the other two (which I don't particularly now).The reason this film wasn't fun to be was that the annoying bully, ""Biff"", played effectively by Thomas Wilson, had a much bigger role than he did in the other ones. This guy was so annoying, he ruined the story for me. They even had him (the same actor, too) playing his son ""Griff"" in the future. Thanks to him, this BTTF Part 2 had a mean edge to it. I wanted an adventure-comedy, not a nasty movie. There was too much emphasis on this villain instead of the lighthearted fantasy that made the first movie such a hit. The writers much have realized this dark formula didn't work as they went back to form for the third in this series, making it a lot funnier and fun to watch.

Darker in tone and plot but still fun all the same with some mind-twisting plot lines and cool effects.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Busier and messier, but sensational fun across three time periods","Back to the Future Part II is a terrific sequel - it may not be the best ever made, but its certainly a novel approach and a great deal of fun. There's a lot going on in this film as we visit three time periods - future, alternate present and past again - and as a result its hard to pin down a single story like in the first or third films.The future storyline struggles to find purpose given Doc's repeated insistence that the future must not be meddled with. That being said its essential for the movie and its so much fun to watch 2015, both as a prediction over the last 30 years and as a bit of humour from now on. Its startling how accurate some things are - Skype, 3D films - while others are a great source of humour. I never realised until this watching that both Marty's son AND daughter are played by Fox. Production design does a great job being funny whilst also conceivable, but the film's makeup is absolutely appalling. If you're going to make Lea Thompson put on that stupid voice and cake her under 100 feet of makeup, just get a different actress. Michael J. Fox as future Marty looks like Bride of Chucky. A man comes up to Marty to ask to save the clock tower and he's clearly caked in makeup, but why? He's no recognisable character after all, they could've just got any old man. Thomas Wilson plays the utterly unbearable Griff, who feels the need to shriek every word like a mental werewolf android. Not a whole lot goes on here and we quickly get out so that the film can set up the dystopian alternate reality.In alternate 1985, Biff has stolen the DeLorean and made himself rich. This is the best plot line that Gale could ever have come up with, because who among us hasn't wished we could do that? Rick Carter and his team create a twisted and brilliant dystopian 1985, and Thomas F. Wilson is exceptional as the evil billionaire Biff. Doc quickly figures out what happened and explains to the audience in a way that is not overly expository because thanks to Lloyd's consistently wacky performance, it is actually a fun scene to watch.Finally we get back to 1955 where the film plays out. Marty and Doc need to get back everything while not tampering with the past AND avoiding their selves from the first movie. This is by far the best part of this movie. Zemeckis blows my mind when constructing scenes that have two Michael J. Foxs noticeably on screen, because it doesn't for a moment look like they've done it with cheap effects. Zemeckis creates an aura of crises by constantly throwing obstacles into Marty's way, so you'll watch Marty's quest for the Almanac on the edge of your seat. The film finishes with one of the most famous cliffhangers and utterly delightful conclusions I've ever seen.Michael J. Fox is older and a bit less enthusiastic about being this wacky kid again, but Marty is such a lovable character that it doesn't matter too much. I always get cheap entertainment out of the whole ""are you chicken"" thing with McFly that was introduced in this film, but objectively its stupid. Lloyd is just as good as in the first film, every bit the wacky mad scientist in his voice, demeanour and even posture. Elisabeth Shue is irrelevant as Jennifer, who is included in the film because Gale and Zemeckis made the mistake of taking her with them at the end of the first, but Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as the various Biffs throughout time. Not many people could play a character as a teen, a tycoon and an old codger with equal conviction.Back to the Future 2 has lots of omages to classic scenes in the first, but none of them feel forced or tacky - there's something delightful about watching Marty flee on a hoverboard instead of a skateboard. Its a great and worthy sequel and a heap of fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Back to the Future 2 is a very good sequel, while considered the darkest of the three it is still quite bright in tone. It isn't as good as the first film though, moving a little too fast and a little too much crammed in such as the past, future and alternative universes idea. Still it is very enjoyable, with the acting from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd as zany and as likable as ever before and the special effects even better than in the first film and that was a hard feat. The script is clever and fun, the direction is excellent and the sets are highly imaginative. Plus the score is great.

One of a kind as a sequel.,"Back to the future part two is a pretty good sequel, but it is unique in a few ways. I do not think it is as good a film as the first one, but it still is a lot of fun.After traveling to the future with Doc, Marty and Doc return to 1985. However upon returning they see that the fabric of time has been altered and now Biff is all powerful. So Marty and Doc must find out what went wrong and correct it.This film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off, however with a different actress as Jennifer this time. A lot happens in this film and it never drags ever in the whole film which is pretty cool. It is kind of like how The Empire Strikes Back has a lot happening in it,this film has that as well.Marty and Doc both are great again. The major character who gets more development in this film is Biff, and surprisingly he is a pretty funny character. I love the part where old Biff talks with younger Biff.This film is by far the most confusing of all three of the Back to the Future films. All of the time traveling is cool, but with so much going on and people almost running into themselves from other times it makes the film very unrealistic.This film is unique in that the last third of the film takes place within the first film. I can not think of any other film that does this. So I think that it is mandatory that you see the first film before you see this one.I think this is a great sequel to the first back to the future. It is not quite as good a film, but I recommend it. But make sure that you see the first film first or else you will get really confused.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Nice sequel, though doesn't come close to the first part.","""Back to the Future Part II"" embarks on yet another exhilarating time travel adventure with Marty McFly and Doc Brown as they dart into 2015, attempting to prevent future calamities for the McFly family. While this sequel thrives on inventive futuristic visions, complete with hoverboards and self-lacing shoes, it leans into a more convoluted plot line that may not capture the same heartfelt nostalgia as its predecessor. The film's strength lies in its audacious depiction of the future and its complex narrative that intertwines multiple timelines, showcasing the filmmakers' creativity. However, the film occasionally succumbs to over-dramatization, particularly towards the end. The showdown involving Biff and the almanac, though crucial to the plot, feels somewhat stretched and overly theatrical, detracting from the core emotional engagement of the story. Despite these criticisms, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is undeniably a fun and worthy continuation of the series. Its bold take on the future and the continuation of beloved character arcs provide a satisfying, if somewhat bumpy, ride. For fans of the first film, watching the sequel is recommended as part of the trilogy's broader narrative arc, although it might not stand alone with the same impact. While it doesn't quite recapture the charm of the original, it still holds its ground as an entertaining piece of cinematic history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Have to watch the films together!,"Have to watch the films together! I watched some of the second film seperatly from the first. Ouch, not good! The 3 film is a series similar to the Sopranos. Recently watching the first film, and then catching the second film on TBS the viewer notices many jokes, hidden meanings which were missed when not viewing the movies recently together. The center theme of the script is the time line conitinuum. If broken, the result could be disastrous. 3 parts of the film I notice is that Michael J Fox wears the same clothes, uses the same expressions etc because it is the 1985 Marty. Genetics and history repeats itself is another inside joke in all three films. A polarity with time travel theme. As history repeats itself the same people do the same things, but a little differently. Biff, is the usually unhappy jerk, who is selfish, and believes everyone owes him. If Biff is not happy, then no one is. This movie is a great set up for what will happen in the third. One can watch ones self, but not interfere, and at the same time learn via the third person.

"""Back to the Future Part II""- An imaginative and entertaining but also contrived and convoluted follow-up in the iconic trilogy.","Trilogies are quite peculiar when viewed in retrospect. Especially when, as is the case for ""Back to the Future Part II"", the storyline is planned out ahead of time for multiple installments. After the success of the outstanding and genre-defining original, director Robert Zemekis sought to complete the story of Marty McFly with a two-part finale that would seamlessly follow on where the original ended. Zemekis, producer Steven Spielberg and writer Bob Gale in essence attempted to produce a singular cohesive story that would unfold over the course of three chapters... one big five-and-a-half- hour movie.The inherent problem with this clever but mildly flawed tactic is the fact that it can make the individual films a bit less digestible when viewed on their own. Sure, the original is stand-alone enough that it can be enjoyed as a complete experience. But you can't really watch the second or third chapters as individual films... they're too episodic and reliant on one-another. Thankfully, though, the sense of fun urgency and the likable characters still shine through, and make the second part of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy a worthy and worthwhile watch. Even if it is a bit too self- indulgent and convoluted at times.Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are forced to travel throughout time once again in order correct an error made by Marty's children in the distant future of 2015. However, in a moment of greed, Marty inadvertently triggers a change in his own present time of 1985 and destroys the lives of all he loves- with his father's old nemesis Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) now in charge of Hill Valley and his father murdered. And so, Doc and Marty must once again attempt to save the present by fixing their mistakes on a journey that will take them to the past, the future and beyond!I think the key issue I have with the film is that of the three installments, ""Part II"" is by far the most needlessly complex and overstuffed entry, with contrivances and convenience taking charge a bit too often. Things just sort-of happen to manufacture tension and drama, even when they feel tacked on and sometimes superfluous. It's not enough for Marty and Doc to travel to the future for a new adventure... they need to travel to the future, then travel to the present, then travel to the past in order to fix mistakes that they themselves caused and easily could have prevented. It all feels a bit too disjointed and random. It does succeed in some playful and eye- popping world building, but its the result of a self-indulgent and shaky story as Zemekis and Gale pile on weirdness and wackiness simply for the sake of weirdness and wackiness. It's not as refined or cohesive as the original, nor is it as straight-forward and rewarding as the final chapter.Thankfully, despite my admittedly huge problem with the structure and the narrative, the film still satisfies on the whole thanks to the electrifying and endlessly likable cast and the imagination and entertainment value that Zemekis specializes in. There's a reason that Marty McFly and Doc Brown have become such beloved and recognized heroes in the annals of popular culture. And the absolutely pitch-perfect performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a big part of this. Both light up the screen and compliment each other well, building off of the original and continuing to prove their remarkable chemistry with one another. They really are one of the finest teams in cinematic history. It's also a ton of fun seeing Thomas F. Wilson continue to deliver as that deliciously evil bully Biff, and supporting roles by the likes of Elizabeth Shue are very well cast. Yes, it's a shame there were some shakeups behind the scenes, and the eccentric Crispin Glover is definitely missed. But on the whole? Great jobs from all involved!And this movie is another prime example of director Robert Zemekis' wild eye for sharp and inspired visual storytelling and his playful sense of tone. The film might suffer for its shaky writing, but it makes up for it with a plethora of high-energy set-pieces and ends up a non-stop visual feast for the eyes. Each timeline presented feels ""real"" in that delightfully ""hyper-real"" way that only Hollywood can deliver, and it's a lot of fun seeing how Zemekis breathes life to different eras. His action is flowing and kinetic without relying on cheap tricks or deceptive editing, and some of the chases and fights still take your breath away all these years later. And the film delivers one of the most mind-bending sequences in movie history with a climactic scuffle that blends different eras of time in a wickedly clever manner as past and future meet once again. Suffice to say and without spoiling anything... it'll change the way you see the original!As it stands, it's hard not to admit that ""Back to the Future Part II"" is the weakest of the iconic and beloved trilogy. It's wonky and contrived and feels very much like it was written on the fly. But that doesn't make it a bad film. And in fact, it's still pretty good. The cast is as delightful and lovable as always and the story is filled to burst with clever sequences and exciting action set- pieces. And it definitely leaves you hungry for more! I give ""Back to the Future Part II"" a very decent 7 out of 10. It might be the weakest of the series, but it's still well worth checking out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Adventure Continues!!,"Back to the Future Part II. And the adventure of time travel ranging from 1955 to 2015 continues. The movie was made in 1989 showing us how earth would be in 2015. Being in 2014, you can't stop yourself comparing that whether they got it right or not. Imagining that by 2015, there won't be any lawyers, justice would be served in 2 hours or so, there will be flying cars everywhere makes you think we are progressing at much lower rate than we could imagine. Marty and Doc find themselves screwing the time lines, creating alternate realities and obviously responsibly fixing the faults made. Despite sitting on a technically confusing plot, writer and director never let things go overly complicated by explaining things in simple English and keeping excellent humor alive and kicking. Peppy instrumental back ground score running almost every second enhance the drama and urgency beautifully. Despite being a sequel to a cult out of box movie, movie succeeds surprising you at many junctures and wherever screenplay crosses with the screenplay of part I, you can't stop yourself saying WOW. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part II. I do not recall any other science fiction being so much funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Not as solid as part 1, but still great","Very good, but very uneven; Part II is both the campiest and the darkest installment in the series. More specifically - the scenes taking place in 2015 have aged badly, and though they have some strokes of genius, they feel strained and rely far too heavily on cheap make-up effects, Michael J. Fox doing a mediocre job at playing Marty McFly's entire family a-la Eddie Murphy (not a pleasant comparison, I know). On the other hand, the scenes in the alternative 1985 are wonderfully dark and edgy compared to the first film, and all the scenes in 1955 - especially the ones made to correspond to parallel ones from the original - are brilliant. The unsatisfying ending doesn't help the fact the it feels a bit like a tweener, but it still stands as one of the most solid sequels ever made, and holds the first and third movies together well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Time Pair of Docs,"After the huge success of the first film, a sequel was required. Too bad for us. The fiction of the possible dream-vision was jettisoned. This is real world stuff.The emphasis shifts from the crazy visions of the crazy inventor to real complications of time folding, such as we can handle in a mainstream Zemeck. And it is pretty darn complicated. We now have parallel worlds, overlapping times, actors playing multiple characters, actors playing the same characters at different ages, characters changing the lines of themselves in earlier states, the time machine coming and going past itself in ways that only make sense if you are tied to the narrative this one way.We also have scenes and tropes from the first movie repeated in slightly different form. The way of tracking whether the future changes is by photos and newspapers that change as their past is manipulated.

The answer: you can't (11/10 doesn't make much sense, does it?)—but you can MATCH it in terms of entertainment value, which is precisely what director Robert Zemeckis and Co. succeed in doing.With many of the original movie's cast reprising their roles (sadly no Crispin Glover or Claudia Wells, but Elisabeth Shue as the replacement Jennifer is more than welcome in my books), awesome special effects from ILM (even today, the hover boards and flying cars look great), a wonderfully inventive plot that'll leave you scratching your head trying to figure out the paradoxical possibilities, and loads of clever visual jokes, Back To The Future Part II is brilliant stuff from start to finish—and that's not even taking into account the added unintentional fun that can be had from the inaccuracy of the film's predictions for the future (unless technology advances a lot in the next five years, I doubt we'll be seeing auto-drying jackets by 2015).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
This is my favorite BttF. Is that bad?,"Yeah I like the Sc-fi elements of this one. Its like the first movie was a Action/Romance?Sc-fi/Comedy that was so perfectly balanced it couldn't be replicated, so the split it up into 2 sequels, so Bttf 2 is an Action/Sci-fi and Bttf 3 is an Comedy/Romance, and surprisingly I like that Action/Sc-fi balance more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Worthy successor,"Not quite as fun and lighthearted as the first one. That being said, Back to the Future II is a wonderful film that brings back many of the best qualities of the first one and introduces some great new elements of its own.The only thing that bums me out when watching this film, is how far we are from the imagined future of 2015, even in 2020. We don't have hoverboards, let alone flying cars. We don't have Jaws 19, and we most certainly don't have the incredible fashion with its self-tying shoes and auto-adjusting jackets.Although Back to the Future II isn't quite as good as its predecessor, it is much better than most of the movies we get nowadays.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"It's Your Characterization, Marty!",The second BTTF outing is another thunderous round of cartoon silliness. It's certainly flabby around the middle and they ludicrously bottle it when it comes to Jennifer's character but there are some odd dark depths and the fantastically inventive replay of the first film is hypnotically intricate.The baffling trailer for Part III at the end is wild. Imagine a Marvel movie doing that these days!,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Hollywood Sequel Machine,"Back to the Future was one of a kind. It was written that way; exceptional attention was paid to detail, and it paid off. Zemeckis had a hit on his hands, and movie audiences swooned: Michael J. Fox at the pinnacle of his acting career paired with a high budget, fantastic script, there was no way the original could fail. Sequels, unless planned, are fated to surpass the bar set by the original story. When the secondary and tertiary scripts are not planned at the same time, the result is cotton candy fare that leaves you feeling empty, like this movie does.Sadly, the sequel(s) reflect the need for Hollywood suits to capitalize on an excellent idea. Instead of inventing truly original second and third scripts where none was originally intended, this and the third film were called for to fill the bank accounts of those involved. Although there are moments when BTTF II shines - such as the splicing of original material with old, bringing back scenes from the beloved original, there is so much kitsch and poor acting, even from the principals, that it's hard to swallow.Michael is Michael, Marty is Marty. Chrisopher Lloyd is Christopher Lloyd, Doc is Doc, and that's about it. Oh yeah, let's not forget old Einstein. The rest of the cast, while mostly returning, could have been forgotten. Michael J. Fox as his son AND daughter? Please. Lea Thompson struggles with multiple identities... the characters are so far beyond belief that it's painful. Where the original film almost made time travel seem plausible (albeit in a goofy way) the sequels make a parody of the original script and seem more like an insult. The budget covers makeup and some fantastic ideas, but it can't cover up the forced feeling that this film and its successor share. Slick effects and obvious humor can't save sequels, but the need to capitalize on a successful franchise overrides originality. Everything about this movie seems clichéd instead of daring. Some actors define their careers by being involved in quality productions; in this film time the cast shows their need to finance a yacht payment.If you can suspend all need for believability, this flick might get it done. But it won't work without the third installment, and for once in my life I have to give credit to Crispin Glover: he may be a freak, but he's an honest freak, and he stayed away from the scripts for a reason. I'd recommend that you do too. Watch the first installment as intended: a standalone production, and find better fare if you need to watch a movie instead of the the poor sequels.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Yay a way sequels are supposed to be made!!!,"Ah Back to the Future. What a timeless classic that film was back in the 80's. It broke new grounds in time travel as a sub-genre in sci-fi movies of the 80's. But how about we experience it again? Sounded great and ludicrous at the same time. The original ended on a cliff-hanger and fans were expecting another Zemeckis masterpiece! Did they get it? ABSOLUTELY!!! I will go far as to say its even better than the original! How did it manage to do that? Well it utilizes the time-travel concept in the story very well and it tied together perfectly. Great job Zemeckis for that phenomenal directing! When people first saw it they thought it was gonna be an impossible feat for the film to match and to exceed the original! But it did! Enough of the history lets get down to brass tax! Back to the Future Part II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Back to the Future. Doc takes Marty and Jennifer(Elizabeth Shue) to 2015 to save their son's future! Meanwhile, in 2015, Marty decides to get a hold of a sports almanac and use time travel as a means of making money. Hmm... a wanna-be billionaire? Isn't that what we wanna be now-a-days? Anyway, Biff gets a hold of the almanac and goes back to 1955 and all hell breaks loose in the time lines. What makes this work is that every scene is cohesively done well and is perfectly paced! Michael J. Fox gives a great performance as Marty as always from Fox. Doc Brown is still fantastic as the mad scientist Doc Brown and my favorite character Biff is just as mean and hilarious as ever! Biff is absolutely freaking hilarious in this movie and has the most funniest quotes I have ever heard in movie history! ""Hey butt head!"" ""Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here!"" OH SO FUNNY XDXDXD Now what did I appreciate in this movie? I love the fact that every scene flows well in this series of events happening in different time periods. I loved the way they fit Old Mcfly with Young Mcfly in the future! Great filmmaking at its finest! I loved all the characters(mainly Biff). Lasy but not least I love the performances and memorable quotes in this movie! It has a certain charm to me that causes to like it every time I watch it! Plus, the special effects were fantastic and the costumes and set work were really good in depicting the future and the past! However, one minor thing that went under my skin was when they repeated the quote ""Chicken"" all the time. But, its not something that breaks the movie it just was a little annoying. But all in all it is a fantastic sequel to already an incredible movie and exceeds the original ten-fold! So get your Delorean to 88 mph and get ready for another awesome ride!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Almost perfect,"The beginning of this one has always felt a tad slow to me, but that doesn't make it an unenjoyable experience in the slightest. The level of effort put forth into this film is honestly staggering. How could they keep track of all this stuff? If you've seen this, you know what I'm talking about. A great time, and not a film that should be mistaken as having bad-sequel-syndrome.A-A MUST-WATCH!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Among the best sequels of all time.,"'Back To The Future Part II (1989)' picks up from its predecessor's purposefully over-the-top cliffhanger and runs straight for the finish, weaving a complex web of potential paradoxes, suspenseful set-pieces and ahead-of-their-time special effects with nothing other than absolute aplomb. Of course, it isn't as good as the first film; nothing is (almost literally). Still, the thing is an absolutely solid sequel that's far, far better than it really has any right to be. There are two things it perhaps does better than its big brother: pacing and VFX. The story starts after mere moments and doesn't let up for a second, keeping you hooked until it reaches its own incredibly iconic cliffhanger ending. The most prominent special effect is an utterly seamless 'acting opposite yourself' sort of thing, which still puts similar efforts to shame. Though the movie is known as ""the one where they go to the future"", it doesn't really get going until it dives into a deliciously devilish alternate 1985. Here, the time-continuum conundrums really start to begin and they are an absolute blast. It's probably closer to what you think of as a time-travel narrative than the more one-off, 'what-if?' story of the first. A lot of that is because this is pretty much the pioneer of most tropes associated with the genre. It's all incredibly well-conceived. For every line of near ham-fisted fan service, the flick gracefully pulls off a beautiful bit of foreshadowing or drops your jaw with a self-eating snake scenario. It's never indulgent, yet knows exactly what it needs to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable and is easily among the best sequels of all time. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy,"Seconds after being left back in 1985, Doc Brown returns in his Deorean and whisks Marty and Jennifer off to the future (2015). Drugging Jennifer for her own protection, Doc tells Marty that he must stand in for his own kid, stand up to Biff's son and thus avert a change of events that would eventually destroy his family. The mission is accomplished fairly easily but both Marty and Jennifer discover their future, and neither likes what they see. Marty tries to smuggle a sports almanac back in time to make money betting. Doc stops him of course but Biff senior overhears and pieces it all together. Returning to 1985, Marty discovers that the present is totally changed, meanwhile Doc works out how it all occurred and sets out to put it right.For all the criticisms of summer ""event"" pictures, it is hard to complain too much about the sheer pleasure that the Back to the Future trilogy gives. Starting where the last film ended, this picks up really well in regards mood and humour. The plot is pretty clever and superficially the complex time-travelling stuff holds up really well and is effortlessly accessible. Of course if you want to tear cosmic holes in it then it can be done but to do so would be like kicking a kitten. Using the plot from the first film to good effect the best thing the sequel retains is the original's sense of fun because it is entertaining and has good pace. One criticism of it would be that, instead of the actual plots used in parts 1 and 3, this has a lot of time jumping instead. That this works means that it isn't too bad that it is a bit overused but it is still a niggle nonetheless.The cast are as good as before and the main ones all buy into the sense of fun required to make it work. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd. Thompson is pretty good and Shue has more to do but from the support cast the dominant performance comes from Wilson, who is basic but does it very well. The effects are impressive for the time although watching it now you will have to forgive the very obvious split-screen technique when actors are playing different versions of the same character at the same time.It is the weakest of the three films but that is not really a major criticism in this film series because they are all consistently enjoyable. The narrative rides the time-travelling gimmick for all its worth but it just about makes it all work. A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part II Is A Decent Sequel,"Back to the Future Part II is not as good as the original, especially compared to legendary sequels like Aliens (1986), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and The Dark Knight (2008).However, the film is still entertaining from start to finish. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel to 2015 at the beginning of the movie to help save Marty's future son.While in Hill Valley in 2015, Marty gets the idea to buy a Grays Sports Almanac - providing the winners of all sporting events from 1950 to 2000 - and bring it back with him to 1985.An older Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) in 2015 overhears Marty's plan when Doc catches Marty with the sports almanac, and Tannen decides to steal the DeLorean time machine and travel back to 1955 to give his younger self the sports almanac.Viewers get to see Marty's family in the future in the beginning, but we don't really learn anything of value. We're told that Marty got into an automobile accident when he was younger, which ended up ruining his music career as a guitarist. Exposition is there just for the next film...More importantly, Marty's future family isn't featured in the rest of the film. It's just not relevant to the movie's main plot, which involves Marty and Doc traveling back in time to prevent elderly Biff from giving his younger self the sports almanac.Simply put, Back to the Future Part II is not really about Doc or Marty's friendship, or even Marty's future family. No, it's actually about Biff. This is not a bad thing per se. The alternate 1985 was an interesting idea. It was executed pretty well.It would have been repetitive for the writers to have both Doc and Marty temporarily stuck in either the alternate 1985 or 2015, but maybe that would have flowed better instead of reshowing scenes from the original movie in the second half of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

An honorable and high quality continuation.,"This is the second film of what was one of the most remarkable trilogies of the 1980s. In the first movie, Marty McFly and ""Doc"" Emmett Brown traveled until the 1950s, until Marty's parents' dating years, using a time machine built from a DeLorean. Now, the pair will need to go to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty and Jenniffer's children from becoming delinquents and dragging the entire family to the bottom. But in the midst of it all, they still have to stop the perfidious Biff Tannen from making a fortune at the expense of inside information about future sporting results. To correct the future and save the present, therefore, it will be necessary to intervene in the past, and return to 1955.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to succeed but it does not prevent the feeling that this movie is, in essence, more of the same as we saw before. If we forget that brief foray into the future (which for me is already a distant past, as I write this text a few years after 2015), the film is nothing really new. At any rate, it's funny to see how, in the 1980s, someone imagined our time. Flying cars? If they only knew that we were more concerned with greening cars than flying them ... But of course, nothing should be taken too seriously here. Speaking of ecology, the film suggests in one scene that DeLorean replaced the use of plutonium with organic debris and rubbish, perhaps using an original type of composter. Curious to check this out.There is little to say about the direction of Robert Zemeckis, or even about the cast, that has not been said or observed in the previous film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film, which will be a constant throughout the trilogy. In this movie, however, the stakes of Thomas F. Wilson, an excellent villain, and Elisabeth Shue, who gain, despite their preponderance, still fall relatively sidelined for much of the movie, literally falling asleep.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. I thought the future was quite interesting, with ultra-modern cars and some crazy ideas, but as I said, it's not something we should take too seriously. It also struck me as interesting to see the same actor playing two versions of himself, although it was clear how this was achieved by splitting the screen.It's understandable why the movie, like the whole trilogy, became so popular. Despite being weaker than the first film, it retained its features well and honored its predecessor, leaving clear signs of a continuation. The trilogy as a whole has aged very well and still has class, charm and style, which cannot be said of all films made in the 1980s.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Time loop to revisit original movie creates incredible sequel,"This picks up right from where the first one ends. Marty, Doc and Jennifer goes to the future to help save his children in 2015. Only things go completely off the tracks when Biff in the future steals the DeLorean to change the past for his benefit.The time travel in this movie is even more complicated. It revisits the 1955 timeline actually make it work better. The scenes where he revisits the same time as the original is truly inventive. The great thing is that it combines with the original to make the whole series even better. It's seamless integration is what makes this sequel superior to any other sequels. It's a work of mathematical genius from Robert Zemeckis.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
As Good As the First Movie,"I was a little apprehensive about this film. How could it possibly stand up to the first Back to the Future movie. But Back to the Future Part II is every bit as good as the first one and takes the franchise further. It begins where the previous film left off, with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) traveling to 2015.There we meet Marty's future family and Old Biff and his grandson (both played by Thomas F. Wilson) and see many futuristic gadgets. However, by a curious turn of events, Marty and Doc have to travel back to 1955, the same year Marty traveled to the previous day, in the first movie.The plot of this film is more complicated than the first one, with multiple time-lines in the past, present and the future. There are multiple Martys, Docs, Jennifers and Biffs at a given time. As you can see, it explores the consequences of time-travel in greater detail. But it is never confusing and as light-hearted as the first movie. It has a lot of good, intelligent comedy. It is nice to see all our favorite characters from the first movie. All the cast, with the exception of Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, have returned, with some of them playing multiple roles. This is one sequel which I am glad they made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Complicated but brilliant,"When I left the theater after watching Back To The Future part II I was like ""This one was even better than the original!"" Part I was my favourite movie of all time, but I liked Part II even better.  The plot is complicated but brilliant and everything is in line with everything else.  People often say it doesn't have the charm that the original has, well in my opinion it has even more. It does have the charm and Part II goes into the past AND the future, which shows earth as it could be within 30 years. Of course an exaggerated world, but you can still see today's world in it, only 30 years later. That's what I really liked about Part II.

Back to the Future Part 2,"Back to the Future Part 2, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, produced by Steven Spielberg & Bob Gale, again, created an enjoyable sequel, while still trying to keep expanding boundaries, but may have gone too over the top, flooding the story with subplots, and too much going on. They incorporated, current present, future, new present & past, making the narrative uneven, with a lot of tone shifts.Michael J. Fox puts on another great performance, with his character being more than occupied. Marty is more matured this time around, other than his hilarious, unexplained anger issues. Doc is the same ol' doc, being energetic, yet super witty, just not getting enough screen time he deserves. We also got another dose of Thomas F. Wilson as Biff. Biff was all over this film, being just as active as Marty, and maybe even more than Doc. Even though his character isn't the most creative, he is a very talented actor, being able to play all these roles, in one film, and staying consistent.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale again, brought the same witty, and humorous dialogue, while incorporating a few familiar lines.The production design by Rick Carter was beautifully displayed. Carter had a lot on his plate, to perfect all these unique settings, and he completed the task with flying colors. The special effects were heavily relied on in this film, but were done very well.Overall, Back to the Future Part 2, may not have been the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it was still loads of fun, expanding on this creative premise, and fun-filled characters!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
*A Bold Leap into Tomorrow and Yesterday*,"*Back to the Future Part II* is a rare cinematic gem that manages to be both a thrilling sequel and a captivating exploration of the complexities of time travel. Released in 1989 and directed by Robert Zemeckis, this film takes audiences on a wild ride that shifts between the bustling future of 2015 and the nostalgic past of 1955, delivering a rich tapestry of adventure, humor, and reflection.The narrative picks up right where the original left off, with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returning to the time machine DeLorean to prevent a disastrous future for Marty's son. The film's portrayal of a not-so-distant future is a brilliant mix of optimism and absurdity, showcasing flying cars, self-lacing shoes, and a world where technology has reshaped daily life in both fantastical and eerily familiar ways. The filmmakers' vision of 2015 serves as an entertaining commentary on technological progress and societal expectations, inspiring both laughter and a wistful look at how our realities compare to their predictions.One of the film's standout elements is its intricate plot, which weaves together multiple timelines and presents a unique take on the butterfly effect. The concept of time travel isn't merely a plot device; it becomes a philosophical exploration of fate, free will, and consequences. As Marty and Doc navigate the tangled web of their decisions, viewers are treated to a thought-provoking reminder of how small choices can reverberate through time, culminating in unexpected results.The film shines in its ingenious use of callbacks to the original and clever reimagining of key scenes, which gives fans a sense of nostalgia while still forging ahead with the story. The appearance of alternate versions of characters and events emphasizes the chaos that time travel can introduce, effectively highlighting the unpredictable and often humorous nature of their journey.In addition to its rich narrative, *Back to the Future Part II* thrives on its memorable supporting characters, including the devious Biff Tannen, masterfully played by Thomas F. Wilson, who continues to be a formidable antagonist even as he faces various versions of himself. Biff's antics provide comic relief while also grounding the story in the timeless struggle between good and evil.Visually, the film is a remarkable achievement, integrating groundbreaking special effects with practical designs that have stood the test of time. The bustling streets of Hill Valley in 2015 are vibrantly brought to life, and the film's creative design choices leave a lasting impression-one that still resonates in today's pop culture landscape.*Back to the Future Part II* is not just a sequel but a bold exploration of the possibilities and perils of time travel. It brilliantly balances humor and depth, serving up a delightful mix of action, wit, and a sprinkling of philosophical musings. As Marty and Doc remind us, the journey through time, filled with adventure and misadventures, ultimately leads to the realization that we are the architects of our own futures. Buckle up and prepare for a trip that's as entertaining as it is enlightening-because in the world of *Back to the Future,* the future truly is just around the corner!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A flawed but uniquely interesting sequel,"There's no doubt that Back To The Future II is a bit of a mess. The script was far too ambitious and falls apart constantly with endless logistical errors and implausible plot leaps.Despite this, the film is still very enjoyable and unlike any other in its genre. The scenes where Marty returns to 1955 and encounters parts of the original story (including himself) are incredibly creative and great fun to watch.The make-up is somewhat disappointing and Thomas Wilson probably deserved better than to be turned into a bizarre waxwork. Everyone still looks great in 1955 but the 2015 characters are a bit far-fetched and ridiculous, particularly with Michael J Fox playing his entire family.Nevertheless, I have watched this move countless times and never get bored with it. If nothing else, it nicely bridges the gap to the finale and allows us all to be disappointed that we STILL don't have hoverboards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Best sci-fi comedy series ever,"You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all.Of course you will laugh at the depiction of 2015 in the second chapter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as one but still a lot of fun,"Back to the Future was never intended to have a sequel but after its huge success they not only filmed a sequel but a third film as well, filmed back to back on a $40 million budget. The film gained $332 million worldwide making it the third highest grossing film of 1989. Part II is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, reprising their roles of Dr. Emmet Brown and Marty McFly.A lot of people say that this film is their favourite in the series but in my opinion, this is my least favourite. To me, part II just doesn't have the same charm I and III has, not only that but the story is very uneven and unnecessarily jumbled, so much so they have to spoon feed you information so people who don't have a clue what's going on can better understand and as someone who did know what was happening it felt irritating.That doesn't mean there isn't anything good about this film, in fact I just listed all the problems I had with this film, so everything else after this is just positives. We again have a fantastic cast playing great characters, with all the time travel and alternate time lines we get to see a fairly wide range from the actors. The humour is spot on with plenty of reason to laugh.The interpretation of the future was also really interesting, of course we now know it's wrong because it's the past now but it was great to see how accurate it was, and with how unique and different it was from many other interpretations of the future it was great to look at. The costume and set design was brilliant and looked fantastic on screen. The visuals of this film was perhaps one of its strongest parts, from 2015 to alternate 1985 everything looked amazing, the special effects were also well done by the always great industrial light and magic. All intertwined with the once again excellent Alan Silvestri score which, while not as memorable as the first, is still fantastic and suits the film well, building atmosphere and tension.While on the note of visuals, we saw a return of some of the great visual comedy which spiced up the humour from the first film, we also see the return of a lot of shots used in the first film which does tie them together.Overall Back to the Future is a great exciting film with the actors getting a lot of chance to shine. Although messy it's still a lot of fun with hilarious and edge-of-your-seat moments all accompanied by a fantastic score.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's Girlfriend Jennifer.There is a lot of references to the first film which is a plus for those who love the first film. I enjoy all of the cool tech that was used and some of the tech we use now thanks to the movie.The acting in this film is very strong and everyone brought their A Game to their roles of the characters they made famous.The effects of the movie remain impressive even today that goes to show that a movie like this does it well with the first film with the tech we see in this film you gotta love the idea of the invention. There were some I wish we had now that would been cool.The story in the film just does it own and prove to be creative and clever to where you could appreciate it and it is full of classic linesSo I can say that the sequel is a strong one and does great to be apart of the Back To The Future TrilogyI give Back To The Future Part 2 an 10 out of 10Great Scott!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

I am a real time travel fan and this film delivers!  All the wonderful paradoxes and continuity problems you'd expect with time travel are illustrated in this film, with the same quality as Part One.  Also, not many films try to portray a realistic view of what the future will look like, and this film does a great conservative job of it.

"Not Better, But Still Holds The BTTF Vibe","""Back to the Future Part II"" is a thrilling and inventive follow-up to the beloved original film, delivering on all the charm and excitement of its predecessor while also expanding the story's universe in exciting new directions. The film's time-travel plot is complex and layered, yet the film manages to balance all its different timelines and alternate realities in a way that's both engaging and easy to follow. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are once again fantastic in their respective roles, and the addition of new characters like Biff Tannen's future self and Griff provides even more opportunities for humour and excitement. The film's visual effects are also top-notch, and the film's futuristic version of Hill Valley is a feast for the eyes. Overall, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is a worthy sequel that continues the series' legacy of high-quality storytelling and entertainment. I personally think it's a good enough sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back again,"The end of part 1 was open - and this replays this ending for everyone. Not just to remind us what happened, but because another casting change had to be made. Marty McFlys girlfriend had to be recast (his father too, Crispin Glover that is, but you won't probably realize that for various genius reasons) - all can be seen in the documentaries on the discs of the movies.This gets us into the future ... well a weird future that already happened (2015), but did not have too many things that the movie predicted. The filmmaker say they knew flying cars would not be a thing (as also can be seen at the end of part 1). But it's neat to see them in a movie. And really funny too. Generally speaking all movies have quite some nice effects. Some you may notice (like the old age make up), some you may not notice that much.The chemistry between Marty and Doc is there and it is really something to behold. Their relationship is the backbone of the movie and he's at least as much a family member if not more to Marty than his actual flesh and blood are. Having said that, other relationships are more complicated and the movie gives us some hints to part 3 ... which if watched back to back can be relsihed and enjoyed even more than having to wait 6 months for the next movie to be released in cinemas.Very enjoyable and very entertaining and has not aged significantly at all",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Weakest of the Three?,"My girlfriend says this is the weakest of the three, and I am inclined to agree. For one thing, they got rid of Crispin Glover, which is a terrible mistake. They also brought in Elisabeth Shue, which is an improvement, but ruins continuity. Beyond that, the story gets a bit garbled.Trying to make a time travel movie without messing with paradox or nonsense is hard. Granted, this film does it better than many time films... but some of it is just silly. The big problem revolves around a sports almanac. The almanac would not be brought to the past if Marty had not been brought to the future. He did not even need to be brought at all, though. Rather than just tell Marty, ""Hey, your son is going to make a mistake on this day -- don't let him"" they travel to the future... but this allows Marty a glimpse of things to come for no good reason.By the way, this opens up the possibility of Marty still betting on the World Series in 2015... getting rich.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Back to Back to the future, present and past.","Back to the Future was a big, big hit. Everyone was crying out of a sequel and the team of Zemeckis/Gale made two sequels back to back.However with Crispin Glover refusing to return as George McFly meant that the story for the BTTF II had to be drastically altered. They went in a complete different direction with just excerpts of Glover used from the original film as well as a double.BTTF II also replaces Marty's girlfriend with Elizabeth Shue and her role has been drastically reduced.BTTF ended with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J Fox) and Jennifer to the future to sort out his kids. This time where they were going they did not need roads.Marty and the crew arrive in 21 October 2015. The day this review was written. At the time I saw this film in the cinema 2015 sure felt like a long time away and you really felt that there would be hover-boards and 3D holographic films. I guess Avatar was the nearest we got to it.Although Marty sorts out his offspring's future it also allows Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and a sports almanac and drastically change the time-line to a darker one. Marty and Doc have to go back to the 1955 and the setting for the original film to restore the original time-line.BTTF II is a fast paced film as it squeezes the plots of three movies in its running time. However by going for a darker alternative time-line some of the charm of the original film was lost which was largely maintained in the future scenes set in 2015. As Fox remarked when the film came out , they wanted the future to be largely optimistic.My biggest issue always was that sports almanac with all the results of sporting events going back 50 years was an awfully thin book. Was it a prototype Kindle?Fox and Lloyd have no problems reprising their roles and very much carry on from the original film. The only odd change of character being that Marty gets upset when someone calls him chicken when he refuses a challenge.Fox has fun playing multiple characters in the film, Lea Thompson also plays her character in different time-lines and Thomas F Wilson is nasty Biff whichever time-line he is in.The film is a rollicking good adventure and a sequel that is almost shoulder to shoulder with the original. Zemeckis and Gale went on a different direction than many people expected. This is no lazy cash grab sequel. Its a time travel adventure that stands on its own self lacing Nikes and stupendously finishes with the set up to a third film.However the film does miss Crispin Glover's offbeat George McFly. I felt this at the time I saw the movie in the cinema and my opinion has not changed 26 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Many people's least favourite of the trilogy.,"Part II takes the surface characteristics of the original but somehow forgets to transfer the original's essence. There is something perfect in the original that just feels forced in the second one. The second one also begins the characteristic of global-scale reproduction of sequences from the original. reproducing entire sequences from the original, set in different eras and reworked. This is done for comedic purposes. We're supposed to recognise the sequences and say ""ha ha, that's right."" It is most certainly done intentionally.Like many sequals it tries to be bigger than the original and ends up being worse. A movie which tells us one brilliant small story vibrantly, so we never forget it, will usually be better than one which tries to tell us many large events and stories. It gives us more time jumping, which ends up making it uneven (which is why it stays in your mind less, I think). Its very episodic, with only the thread of getting the sports alamac off Biff and Marty and Doc to hold it together.It involves larger-scale changes to the future: Biff's becoming rich means the entire world is thrown into disarray for a portion of the film, entire areas are slums, brothels and biker-gang hovels. This kind of superlative treatment of plot will only really work for kiddies, who'll find it too unpleasant anyway.Plus, it also makes a whole lot less sense. Because it deals with so many time-jumps, there are so many more places to slip up and disregard the rules established within the world of the film for time travel: that interacting with anything in the past will change it, for instance.What is clever about the second one, and was always the thing I liked most about it when I was a boy, was how Marty and Doc go back to when the first film was taking place, and we run into those events again, we see Marty, George and Lorraine doing their bits from the first movie. Its fairly obviously trying to get people to say ""oh isn't that clever,"" but its still pretty fun all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Busy, beleaguered sequel","Gloppy-looking follow-up to ""Back to the Future"", a 1985 hit where time-traveling Marty McFly visits the past; here he finds himself in the year 2015, attempting to retrieve a book of statistics that could change the course of history. The goofy charm of the original has been replaced by brittle satire (why are all movies set in the future so sour and cynical--as if technology itself sucks the joy out of living?). The pacing is fast, but somebody forgot to add in the jokes, and Michael J. Fox looks weary. The dark, dreary production is another obstacle.

great movie,Back to the future 2 is a great movie. I love the hoverboard.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A worty sequel...,"""Back to the Future Part II"" is a very stylish and entertaining sequel to the 1985 classic ""Back to the Future"".The movie picks up where the events from the first movie left us, which is great. Because I personally do love it when a sequel is a direct continuation of the previous movie. And ""Back to the Future Part II"" does so efficiently and quite well.The is a lot more time traveling going on in this sequel, compared to the first movie - for better or worse. Was it beneficial to the movie, certainly, because it was needed to tell the story and it was needed to set the plot and story.The future segment was funny, although set in 2015 with a way, way, way more futuristic vision of how time actually panned out. Sure, that was campy and entertaining to see. And for some reason then director Robert Zemeckis included a lot of plastic accessories for guys to wear in the future - reminiscent of the glorious 1980s, but made to look strange and futuristic. And the ""Jaws 19"" jab just cracks me up every time.Then Marty and Doc return to 1985, but to an alternate timeline with massive changes done to the history. This segment was funny as well and equally detailed. This is where the drama was amped up and took over the storyline.The best part of ""Back to the Future Part II"" is when Marty and Doc return to 1955. That segment was pure genius. I loved how director Robert Zemeckis incorporated the events from the first movie and then had the characters interact with the environment of the 1955 era and try not to interfere with Marty and Doc from that first movie. It worked so well, and it was a pure joy to watch that on the screen. And this segment is really the heart and spirit of the movie.The storyline was quite good, and it was well tied together given the different timeline jumps and interactions with the events of the first movie. I must admit that I have always been adequately entertained by the story in this sequel.As in the previous movie, they had assembled the cast once again, which included Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and Elisabeth Shue. And also included Billy Zane, Jason Scott Lee and a very young Elijah Wood.While ""Back to the Future Part II"" is not fully up to par with the original ""Back to the Future"" movie, then it is a strong addition to the franchise and is a definite must watch if you enjoyed the first movie. However, like this first movie, then this sequel is a movie that you also can watch again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as I remember,"The characters are caricatures. You call McFly a 'chicken' and you can get him to do whatever you want. It's as if the creators view the audience as children.The series is called Back to the future but there's only a short period where they actually go to the future. They have the entire history and future of the world to play around with and somehow they keep going back to 1955. Which was fine in the first movie, but to revisit it again in the second movie is just overkill. If you have a time machine, would you not want to visit the dinosaurs, or want to meet Chingis Khan or Jezus, or perhaps see the world a million years into the future rather than spending Gigawatts of power to visit 1955? I get that it makes sense in the story, but the creators wrote the story... so why not make it interesting instead? I think this entire movie could have been set in the future and it would have been better.I also find the entire thing too stressful and hard to enjoy. As a viewer you're constantly worried about what they're going to do next to mess with the timeline. The characters are constantly in a hurry despite the fact that they have a time machine. Doc Brown is smart enough to invent time travel, but apparently dumb enough to put the fate of the entire galaxy in the hands of a teenager that obviously doesn't have the slightest clue about quantum mechanics.Also, the special effects are dated.The movie is fun if you're a kid, but as an adult it's pretty lame in my humble opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

One of the worst movies ever made.,"After re-watching the original with my young son (I watched it with him--we both loved it of course) we rented this sequel, which I had never seen. It was *really* painful to watch.Most of the problems seemed to be traceable to the writing, which is strange as it's the same Gale/Zemeckis pair that wrote the original. The humor had a tiresome elbow-in-the-ribs obviousness to it, the dialog lacked any charm or style and seemed largely devoted to (re-)explaining what was going on right in front of us on the screen (perhaps an aid to the visually impaired?), and the conceptualization of the future never rose above kind of warmed-over Jetsons idiocy (flying cars, video-screen robot waiters, self-tying shoes, hoverboards instead of skateboards, etc.).The fine cast seemed to be almost uniformly phoning it in, making the few who seemed to actually be working at it (Christopher Lloyd, for one) seem incongruous and pathetically out of place, as if they were in a different movie.Incoherent, un-amusing, and utterly pointless.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
You got me going in circles,"Whose on first? There's McFly's in the future and lots of dopplegangers in the past (1955 & 1985). Some reviewers said there was too much of Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) both the old Biff guy and the young tough Biff guy but I liked the conflict that this sequel created with the tug of war(s) between the old and current Biff's and Marty McFly's. I was disappointed that Crispin Glover did not reprise his role as Marty McFly's feeble father George McFly but the writers were able to work him out of this film sequel admirably. (I understand Crispin Glover had sued Zemeckis for the illicit use of his image via a mask and he won his lawsuit?)At more than one point I will admit I lost track if Marty and Doc were in 1955 or in 1985 and which Marty McFly was real or travelling back to the future. Although the storyline was not as intriguing as the original it was more than enjoyable to want Mrs. Shullivan and I to proceed further and immediately plop in disc 3 and watch the finale film Back to the Future 3.I mean, who isn't curious what the future has in store for yourself eh?I rated this sequel an excellent 9 out of 10 rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Almost As Good As the Original...Extremely Underrated...,"Let us recall the cliffhanger of an ending from the original `Back to the Future.' It is 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is back from 1955. His girlfriend Jennifer (played by Elizabeth Shue this time around) and him are admiring his newfound truck. That's when Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) came back to 1985 in a hovering Delorean and brought Marty and Jennifer into the future with him. This is where the audience comes back into the film, in the year 2015. And let me tell you, Doc and Marty have really got their hands full this time`Back to the Future Part II' did something that not many sequels do. Because of this, it is one of the best sequels ever made. Let me explain.In a lot of movies the directors and writers complain about how the movie would have been better, but they had to make a movie that `people who didn't see the first film would understand.' Let me say something in regard to these pitiful statements. It's the fault of the people if they didn't see the original film and decided to watch the sequel anyway. Why watch a sequel if you haven't seen the first?! I guess a lot of people do  Well, `Back to the Future Part II' was made for the people who saw the first. You just simply can't follow the storyline if you haven't witnessed the awesome power of the original (not `awesome' as in punk dialogue. I mean the true definition of awesome. Look the word up). I have seen people watch `Part II' who haven't seen the first before. It's almost funny watching them become so confused. I try to explain what's going on to them, but it is pointless. The movie is simply for those who have seen the first, plain and simple.Another wonderful aspect of `Back to the Future Part II' is that it broke away from the almost stereotypical `dark' look of the future. Blade Runner had a very sullen and dark look. Good for the film, yes, but I commend `Back to the Future Part II' for creating their own look for the future. Instead of grainy, dark images, we are presented with a very bright atmosphere. Objects are almost bouncing off the screen they are so bright. It is great.I also think that this sequel plays more on the whole idea of how changing things in the past effects things in the future. In fact, the original title of the film was going to be ""Paradox"" instead of ""Back to the Future Part II.""And then there are the marvelous, confusing-to-some plot twists that really keep you thinking, but still provide enough humor and fun to create a very, very worthy sequel to the barely superior original film.I do not really understand why people do not enjoy `Back to the Future Part II.' I read some reviews, and it appears that it is mainly because so many people saw it without seeing the original. Why would they do this? Again I ask myself and achieve no answer.Go buy the trilogy on DVD. They are great films, even if the third was a little disappointing.4.5/5 stars for `Back to the Future Part II.'John Ulmer",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Fun with paradoxes!,"Of the series, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is certainly the busiest, what with its various timelines, character iterations and manic pace. And I can absolutely understand why that would've been a point of contention back in '89. But to me, that's all apart of the ride. It's almost a caveat to the enjoyment of this movie that there was never supposed to be a sequel. And seeing as Gale and Zemeckis wrote themselves into a corner with the ending of Part I, what they did with this is impressive.I still love the gags during the future sequence and just the way the world is depicted. Also, a flying DeLorean is just ridiculously cool. ""Part II"" is a technical marvel; and even with its lack of resolution, this is still a very entertaining movie.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Too convoluted but engaging fun.,"This generally enjoyable sequel to the (excessively) popular 1985 sci-fi comedy manages to be more imaginative than its predecessor, as others have already remarked. The freewheeling spirit of the film helps us ignore some gaps in logic, gaps that are perhaps inevitable since the script exploits so many possibilities of the central premise. Michael J. Fox is enormously engaging as the hero, Thomas F. Wilson hits the mark with a scary performance, but couldn't there be more scenes with Elizabeth Sue?   (**1/2)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"As far as sequels go, this is great entertainment","It happens a lot: you get a wonderful, original movie that's both funny and exciting, and then you get a sequel that tries to be as good as the original, but it tries too much, and turns out to not even come close. ""Back to the Future Part II"" isn't an exception, but it's definitely an improvement.Here's the story: literally starting off where the original ended, Doc takes Marty (and Jennifer) to the future (2015, to be exact), where Marty has to correct a terrible incident that would result in disaster to his family (his future family, that is). And he more or less succeeds in doing that. However, what happens next is where the plot really takes off: Marty buys a sports almanac with statistics from 1950-2000 in it, simply to take back with him to 1985, and use it to 'place a couple bets'. But not if Doc has anything to say about it! Doc throws it away immediately, reminding Marty that that's not what he built the time machine for. So what's the problem? Seventy-seven year old Biff Tannen overhears that whole conversation! So what does he do? Exactly what 17 year old and 47 year old Biff would do: he takes the book from the trash can, steals the DeLorean, goes back in time, and gives the book to young Biff and tells him exactly what to do with it. How Doc and Marty find out about all this is far to interesting to reveal. And there are still a few surprises after that, but I think I may have already gone too far.So the bottom line for ""Back to the Future Part II"" is this: no, it's not as good as the original. The primary reason is the fact that the first 30-40 minutes or so are just too 'gimmicky', with too many little jokes about what the year 2015 will be like in Hill Valley. However, it's the second half of the movie that's really worth watching, as Marty and Doc travel all over time, trying to put Hill Valley and everyone in it back to normal. Another reason to see this is simply so you can watch ""Back to the Future Part III"", which is even better than this one (really).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but something is missing...","I remember I had watched the first film a long time before I saw this film. The first one was phenomenal, and I remember I caught a tiny bit of this one on TV, and really wanted to see what they thought 2015 would be like. I also wanted to see Marty's kid.The film picked up several seconds before the first one ended, and the movie kept going like nothing. I loved seeing Marty's kid, even though it was only brief; then things got a little weird.When Jennifer was at her future home, I felt the whole scene was weird. She was unconscious, blah blah blah. Back to the real story: they pick up an unconscious Jennifer and return to 1985. However, Hill Valley has become a ghetto, and the scene is pretty funny. Things build up for awhile in this new 1985, until Marty must go back to 1955.Now we are following Marty on the day in which the Enchantment Under the Sea dance takes place. Marty needs to get something from Biff that will affect 1985 and return them back to the normal future...At the end is another twist and it ends. Now read a review for the first film. Then read this one again. You'll notice how calm and spectacular the first film sounds, and in a way, how lousy this film sounds. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful film, but it lost it's magic. The first film had something so deeply special, and once the story becomes complex, time consumes the humor and magic of this film (except for some moments in 2015 that will remind you of the first film!!)

Viewers Would Be BACK To Watch This Sequel,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this sequel. This is a brilliant film for all viewers to watch. The storyline is great. The cast selection is mighty and incredible. They continued to commit and connect from the first instalment. The chemistry between them is strong. This film makes viewers really think about their lives and the world that they live in. It makes viewers wonder about the multiple possibilities of what a parallel universe of their world would look like and what that would do to their lives. Another thing that it makes viewers think about is the pathways and possibilities that the future may hold for them. It makes viewers wonder if they need to change their lives for the better.

You gotta go forward to save the past and back to alter the future.,"Yikes!Back to the Future Part II sees Marty & Jennifer coerced by Doc into travelling forward in time to correct the future. But Biff is still around and spies an opportunity for untold riches; which he takes. Meaning our three time travelling wonders have to find a way back to the past to stop Biff from changing the course of history.The gargantuan, and deserved, success of Back To The Future ensured {demanded} that a sequel would follow. So taking the bull by the horns, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gray crafted not only a sequel, but a trilogy, of which part two is ultimately a sort of interim plot filler for the finale to come a year later. There's no doubt about it, part two is at first a puzzle box of a picture, one that had this particular viewer back in the day venturing in for multiple viewings to unravel the deft, daft, but intricate plot.I have grown to love part two very much as I have got older, with each viewing tending to reward me just a little bit more. Directed with absolute keenness by Zemeckis, the film moves at such a pace there is barely time to catch breath, something that hardly helps one to follow exactly what is going on. But it does make sense under scrutiny, and as we lurch from one magnificent set piece to another, we find a dark undercurrent of bleakness in amongst the froth.The makers offer up two visions of the future, one is all colourful and swamped in glorious 80s nostalgia, yet it's knowingly enveloped in consumerism and hi-tech reliability. The other is bitten by greed and almost under despotic control, it's food for thought and rather wry in its telling. Not content with that, the makers whisk us back to 1955 just to remind us that a time of innocence and hope did exist; and simultaneously with skill they repeat the ending of part one with the additional story of part two! Clever eh? The returning cast are again uniformly strong {Michael J. Fox, Thomas F. Wilson & Christopher Lloyd} while Elisabeth Shue confidently steps into Jennifer's shoes after Claudia Wells {Jennifer in part one} fell ill and was unable to continue the role. Alan Silvestri's score still packs a cross dimension's punch and the effects crew again come up trumps {it's ace in HD}. It now can be seen as the bridge between two better movies, that's for sure, but I liken it to Spielberg's Temple Of Doom-more darker than the more favourable films in a series; but one that is crucially still having fun. It may be a high-tempo ball of funny confusion at times, but this one, courtesy of it's ream of homages and sly observations, is one of the best trilogy sandwich fillers going.Munch it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the First Movie,"The journey continues, picking up right where we left off at the end of Back to the Future. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. So off to 2015 we go. The future. And then we go hurtling back to the past, 1955 again. With a pit stop in a dystopian 1985 in between. It's quite the adventure, albeit a tad confusing if you're not really paying attention. The first movie was very straightforward, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents ended up together. Simple. This one is not so simple, it's a bit of a maze. But a maze well worth working your way through. Back and forth through time Marty and Doc Brown go and we're along for the very enjoyable ride.In 2015 Marty and Doc do what they set out to do, preventing Marty's future son from getting himself in major future trouble. And the vision of what 2015 would look like which director Robert Zemeckis presents is a hoot. Flying cars are only the start. But Marty and Doc aren't there for some time-travel sightseeing, they accomplish their mission and get the heck out of there and head back to 1985 before they can screw anything up. Little do they know they screwed everything up. When they get back to 1985 it is not the Hill Valley they know and love. Hill Valley is now Hell on Earth, a miserable place lorded over by the evil Biff Tannen. What happened? Well, as Marty and Doc soon discover while they were in 2015 old Biff stole the time machine and went back to 1955 where he gave his young self a sports almanac with the results of all major sporting events for the rest of the century. Biff bets on all the winners, becomes obscenely wealthy and takes over the town. When Marty and Doc get back to 1985 they find that fate and Biff have now dealt them a very unkind hand. But if Marty thinks he's got it bad he need only look at what's happened to his poor parents who've got it much, much worse. Only one thing to do. Hop in the DeLorean and head back to 1955 to prevent Biff from getting his hands on that book. They must set right what has gone horribly wrong.It all sounds a bit convoluted and in truth there are times where the movie is a little too complex for its own good. The first movie was just flat-out fun all the way through. Here the movie has to slow down to explain itself. And things are much bleaker this time around too, the alternate 1985 being such an awful place. The sooner the movie gets out of there the better off it is. Especially considering where it is the movie's going. Back into 1955, back into the very day which served as the climax of the first film. Yep, we're going back to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. It's the rare opportunity for a movie to go back into itself, see itself from new perspectives and Zemeckis takes full advantage of the opportunity. Those scenes we know so well from the first film are given new twists and it is here that this sequel really shines. Watching Marty try to solve his new problem without undoing what he did in the first film is simply terrific stuff. Part II may not have been as consistently captivating, nor as out and out fun, as the original but the story ultimately pays itself off brilliantly.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are pitch-perfect again as Marty and Doc. Thomas F. Wilson does a great job playing multiple incarnations of the villainous Biff. Poor Lea Thompson spends most of her screen time playing older versions of Marty's mom Lorraine, to whom time has been unkind. Thompson does what she has to do well but the film does miss that youthful charm, spunk and vivaciousness of the first film's Lorraine. And the film also clearly misses Crispin Glover in the role of George McFly. Glover is such a unique performer, he brought so much bizarre yet endearing personality to the role of George. This film's attempt to work around Glover's absence is awkward to say the least. But best not to quibble about what this movie misses. Better to embrace what it has. It's a great story which takes us on a wild journey through the space-time continuum. Yes that story requires a little effort on the part of the audience to keep up through all its twists and turns. This movie doesn't make itself as easy to enjoy as the first one did, you have to work a little for this one. It's worth working for. Marty and Doc are such great characters, such a great team. You can't wait to see where they go next. Part III couldn't come soon enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future was the past.,"Wednesday October 26, 2015Far from the tumult of Hill Valley, Lima appears a normal day, each inhabitant with his routines, going in public transport or in terrestrial cars towards the work, the school or the university. There is no flying car or aircraft; the roads are still up to us, you can walk on them without falling into a void.On the way to the corner bar, there is a park where the skaters juggle with the board. They are incapable of flying that objects, they only rotate in the air thanks to the impulses of their owners, without floating.Next to the park there is a coffee bar. The sign hardly shines or moves. The bar offers refreshments of all kinds, as classic as Coca- Cola, lacking Pepsis Perfect. Without holes-robots that carry the drink wherever one sits, the waiter brings the drink to the corresponding place.Along the street there are people walking with their Nike, their Vans or their Puma, which do not have an overhead propeller. Neither are dogs walking alone.My home is normal, with painted walls, a salon in which stands a television with plasma screen above a piece of furniture and a reddish sofa. I do not have the honor of having TV walls and screens that protrude from the closets, though they would be quite practical. Neither do I have the privilege of having seen Jaws 19, and if it existed, I do not know if I could bear it.I live in an environment dominated by ultra-thin computers, plasma screens, touch-sensitive phones and electronic devices connecting wirelessly, or what is the same: Wi-Fi. I live well, in a technologically advanced society, something that was predicted in a way 20 years ago in some science fiction films.Future journeys in fiction entail a dose of imagination on the part of its creator. The ambiance and futuristic arrangements that are made are impossible to be 100% successful, each director and scriptwriter try to play their way, and can hardly hit the spot. Nor do they have the obligation to be visionaries. In Blade Runner, Terminator, Clockwork Orange, Her or Mr Nobody are manufactured in one way and labeled as dystopias. If my father in the 80s, with only 20 years, had traveled 30 years ahead, it would never have been possible to imagine that the present society would be as it is.Marty McFly accidentally changed the lives of his parents at a time when he was not even born, succumbed to the temptation to change the way they fell in love, and then scored a rock and roll with Johnny B. Goode, a song not yet written (landmark of cinema). How many would we take a temporary trip to contemplate other times? Time travel in the cinema is usually pleasant to watch, even if it is foreseeable round trip trips.Back To The Future is an icon inside a family commercial cinema that had its boom from the 80's; its image and idea has influenced productions of future generations. Quite simply, the difference between the commercial of now and the former is its magic, a magic that now finds it difficult to find and / or believe. Few movies have a script as simple and effective as Back To The Future: a broken love story with a cupid falling from the future to fix it. Likewise, he likes it very much; I may be subjectivized, but I can not help it: I saw her at the age of only 9 and my memories invade me. We all know how it ends, and even Zemeckis decided to give ball to two more parts; one undervalued and the other made a little out of obligation. The second part includes three temporary trips and three different generations: the 50, the 80 and the 2010. It is a chaotic film in the plot and unpredictable, something that is appreciated. And it was the one that marked a milestone in pop culture because Marty lands in our 2015.After so many years of having seen the trilogy for the first time (and having repeated it so many times), we finally broke the 30-year span between Marty's real life and that of 2015. I feel a little older because I was thinking about the day that Marty McFly would arrive and I was far away. But here I am, writing about something that is happening today. Tomorrow Back To The Future will become part of the past once and for all. It will remain in our heads and hearts as one of the films that have left us the most footprint. Marty will not return later, will travel back in time to a landscape west and then relive as it should in 1985.Whether or not Zemeckis agrees with his predictions is not of importance. Today we celebrate something fictitious that so many fascinated in its day. For these reasons, the term ""cinema"" is of such a complicated definition.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Past, alternate present and future  In reverse order!","""Back to the Future 2"" is at least as engaging, entertaining and compelling as its predecessor, and that's already a praiseworthy accomplishment when dealing with sequels and/or second installments of a trilogy. Part two is perhaps slightly less regarded as a cinema classic than the 1985 original, but that's merely just because the surprise element has gone and because all the characters already feel familiar, as the screenplay is equally solid and eventful  arguably even more so. The story lines here are admittedly more hectic and convoluted, but returning director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale never at one point lose their grip on the story that is literally stuffed with paradoxes, time loops, inside-jokes, subtle references to prequel and sequel, clever hidden trivia and accurate time details. The first film merely just featured one major journey through time, but the splendid DeLorean time machine sets off no less than three times now. Barely returned and recovered from his first time-traveling adventure, Marty as well as his girlfriend Jennifer get picked up by Doc Brown to prevent something from happening in the year 2015, before it tragically affects Marty's private family life. Everything goes more or less according to plan, except for the aging Biff Tannen  the McFly family eternal nemesis  borrowing the DeLorean and traveling back to 1955 to hand over an almanac with sports results to his younger self and give instructions on how to make easy millions. With the alternate 1985 being a hellish wasteland to return to, Doc and Marty have to go back to 1955 as well and prevent young Biff discovering the truth about the almanac he received from old Biff. Meanwhile, they have to pay close attention in order not to interfere with their other selves who're there to fulfill the mission narrated in part one. It's honestly far more complex to give a brief description of the synopsis than to actually watch the film, because then the whole story simply seems to unfold automatically. All the different and hugely diverse themes neatly merge together, as if the screenplay wrote itself! There are some mild changes in comparison with the original film  released four years earlier what a long waiting period that must have been for the impatient fans  like the absence of Crispin Glover as Marty's dad and Elizabeth Shue taking over the role of his girlfriend (and apparently future wife), but generally speaking the most vital aspects and cast members remained. The humor is still incredibly effective and the action sequences are impressively staged and performed, notably the final showdown between Biff and Marty in the tunnel. Obviously the story lines are more absurd, the plot twists more grotesque and the use of special effects more plentiful, but basically this still remains a Hollywood sequel and they simply have to be bigger, louder and extra spectacular. At least here it's never at the expense of ingenuity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A Bit Too Confusing and Dark,"I just loved Back to the Future (the original) when it was released in 1985, and was suddenly struck with the urge to see Part II.   This time the 1985 teen hero travels to the future of 2015, then back to 1955, then to a new alternative, Bladerunner-like present (1985), then back to 1955 before..... Although ok (we gave it a 7 on the 1 to 10 scale) it had some rather serious problems. 1. It's confusing, and would be hopelessly so if you haven't seen the original. 2. It lacks the whimsy of the first installment.  Things seem grimmer, there is even a murder (luckily only heard and read about but nonetheless incongruous to this type of film). 3. Very cutsey commercializations of products like Pepsi, and they are all over the film.  Very obnoxious. 4. An unanticipated problem is their portrayal of how hip and cool the present is (1985), is aging badly.  While in 2015 a scene is filmed in the Club 80s, a 1980s nostalgia club...and now you can't tell what is intentionally or unintentionally camp. And the movie ends with a cliffhanger ""to be continued....Part III.I hope they wrap it up better than Part II.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"The weakest, but still entertaining","O.K, so the second part is always considered the weakest, and from a general standpoint it probably is, but there is still many admirable qualities about part 2.  For a start, the special effects and the visions of the future were imaginative and carefully planned.  Michael J Fox and Christopher lloyd are still adorable in their respective roles.  Although the rest of the cast, with the exception of Biff have little to do.  The scenes for 1955 are just a rehash of the first, but there is very little that they actually could have done to prevent that.  I thought they integrated the new characters into the old scenes quite well, in keeping with the original story from part 1.  Obviously well planned.  Because the end runs directly into part 3, part 2 was necessary for part 3 to occur.  It is a filler in a way which was made into a film of a sort.  My Conclusion, although its not as engaging as 1 or 3, it's still a worthy part of the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Sometimes Good, Often a Mess","The first ""Back to the Future"" was a whimsical fantasy adventure that managed to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction into a delightful ""what-if"" scenario.  ""Part 2"" picks up at the moment the original left off, with Marty and the Doc heading into the future to prevent a family disaster.  Once again, the movie attempts to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction, but this time the total is less than the sum of the parts.In the future, Marty tries to keep his son from getting arrested for robbery, which he does, but in the process his now aged nemesis Biff steals the DeLorean and changes the his future, which, of course, changes Marty's as well.  Marty and the Doc are unaware of Biff's actions until they return to the past--er, present--and discover a world they no longer know.  Their only choice is to go back in time and prevent Biff from changing history.When stated in the form of a paragraph, the plot seems basic and flowing, but the movie is anything but.  The film has all the necessary ingredients to create a worthy sequel to the original, but none of the pieces fit together.  All the scenes feel like one-act plays, none really relating to the other until the third act, which does manage to tie a couple of threads together, but even then, many of the early parts fell like so much filler.Gone is the wry humor of the original (""You are my density""), and the cleverness of the plot, the fun of exploring the possibilities of a time paradox.  What we get in return is a chance to watch the original movie from a different angle (literally)--a treat, to be sure--but that doesn't come until the third act.  At that point we're reminded of the fun of the original ""Future"", something this sequel can't manage to recreate.In some ways, the sketchiness of the film makes sense.  The fact that ""Part 2"" doesn't end (the plot is resolved, but not everyone is where they should be) and the hints to ""Part 3"" littered throughout this installment indicate that the two films were meant to be a single story.  Together, I guess they do form a complete whole, but when compared to another ""bridge"" sequel, ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"", even that excuse fails to satisfy.  I think what we really have is filmmakers with a deadline that forced them to cut short the rewriting phase.  Pity.7/10**1/2C",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The best screenplay,"The 2nd installment of the series proves why Back to the Future trilogy has one of the best screenplays of all time. All the three movies stick together in such a perfect way, with almost no plot holes (maybe none?). When the trailer came out back in 1989, everyone thought it would be much simpler, know that they would go to the future; The idea of a paradox and revisiting the past once again, encountering yourself (while fixing a mess) trying to fix what once was a mess, is a true head scratcher. Not the best in the series, but the perfect way to stick a beginning and an end. Some may not know, but they films both parts II and III together, almost simultaneously. While Zemeckis was doing part III, Bob Gale would be supervisioning part II, and vice-versa.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
What a fantastic continuation of the original,"I just got done watching Back to the Future Part II (1989) for the first time ever and while this movie was an great way to continue the trilogy.Positives for Back to the Future Part II (1989):
It was fun to once again step back into the world with these characters and their shenanigans. The movie does touch on the concept of the consequences of time-travel and how it can drastically effect certain events in time which I would hope doesn't happen at any point. I still really enjoyed the movie's cast here and you get some new additions in there. Michael J. Fox is still charming and captivating as Marty McFly as he was in the original. Christopher Lloyd is even more ecentric and crazy as Doc Brown here than he was in the original and he manages to make that work. Thomas F. Wilson is still great as Biff Tannen and he is somehow even more despicable here than he was in the original which makes his failures here even more satisfying to watch happen. I also really liked Elisabeth Shue as Jennifer Parker even if she's not in the movie for that long. It was really cool to see a cameo from a young Elijah Wood. Alan Silvestri's musical score is still awesome here as it was in the original. There are still some amazing special effects in this movie with the time-travel sequences. You get some fun little action set pieces here with the hoverboard. And finally, I love the way how this movie ends while also setting up things for the next movie in this trilogy.Negatives for Back to the Future Part II (1989):
The only thing that I can say about this movie is that it doesn't feel quite as fresh or unique as the original, but that's very common with a lot of sequels.Overall, Back to the Future Part II (1989) is a fantastic continuation of the original and I can't wait to watch Back to the Future Part III (1990).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest movies ever made,"I believe this is one of the best movies ever created. Also it's my favorite. It has everything, Comedy, Sci-Fi, adventure, a bit of romance and much more. The story is simply great, and the acting was great, Honestly If I've had to choose between this movie or any of the Matrix Trilogy, I would choose this, just for having such a complex topic and how it goes across the story. I believe I've seen this movie like 50 times, and I've never get tired. Michael J. Fox acted great, he really gave me the idea he was really Marty and that he was confused because of the time alteration he made. One more thing... This movie has one of the coolest musics I've heard.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Are we back?,"Picture it: Phoenix. Saturday, November 25th, 1989. It was early evening at the old UA Theater at Metrocenter. There I sat at the far right of the largest theater, next to the wall since the place was packed, and on the edge of my seat, for the entire length of 'Back to the Future Part II.' See, I was a huge fan of the original, and was thrilled to see the continuation. I wasn't let down. It had action, adventure, 4x the time travel (which originally I was disappointed in #1, since I was a kid that wanted to see time travelers actually time travel), comedy and suspense. I guess the only thing I didn't like, though I did want to see even more when it finished, was the long preview of 'Part III' and the only reason I wasn't thrilled was I didn't like westerns and that's all it looked like to me. This was probably the best movie going experience in my life, before and since – due to the anticipation and excitement of a 15-year-old boy. Fast forward almost exactly 20 years, and after re-watching the entire trilogy, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, it's still a good movie, still had great adventure and comedy, but gone was the original's magic and heart. Too many scenes, characters, events and clues were given specifically to be solved or revealed in 'Part III.' I know it's a classic bridge movie, but it really got tedious attempting to take mental notes of what's to come. The special effects were almost laughable (the first movie came out 4 years prior and still topped this one) and Fox certainly showed his age. Nevertheless, it's a must see for fans, especially since it's required viewing (bridge) to the finish off the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Pure fun and entertaining time travel movie!,"It's an exciting sequel to one of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) this time journey to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty's son from being thrown in prison. However, Marty's nemesis, an elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), got a hold of the time machine and used it to change his past in 1955, sending the course of events to spiral out of control, leaving Marty and Doc to journey back to 1955 to prevent what Biff created.The special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean, and the futuristic look, with the flying cars and skateboards, in 2015 was a great touch.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film captivating throughout, from Marty seeing his son in the future to him chasing Biff around to steal a sports almanac which Biff stole from the future to use to change his past. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the future and back to the past was just entertaining. And, Doc's notion that no two of the same persons must run into each other in the same time dimension adds onto the suspense of the film - great fun!Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and James Tolkan. They all made the film engaging and intriguing.

Enjoyed in childhood but can't help noticing flaws in 2022,"It's still fun especially the future part, I love seeing the auto-size-adjust shoes and clothes, the hoverboard and 3D movie ad etc.However, I can't help but notice the story is forced to create more events and arcs. The whole thing could have avoided if Doc goes back to the future when Marty buys the sport statistic magazine and just burn it or stop Marty before he buys it. I know if they did that, this movie would have ended there, but then I wanted the writers to sell me harder why Doc couldn't choose the path.Some choices that characters make seem way too questionable and sometimes contrived and it may have convinced the audience back then like I was as a child, but it maybe cringy to watch if you don't take into account that this film was made more than 30 years ago.Another thing is that many characters coexist with themselves at the same moment although that's the last thing you want as a premise. In Biff's case, he even interacts with himself, yet the incident doesn't mess with quantum physics at all.Lastly, Biff is just so horrible as a human being. I mean he's clearly a sociopath. I can't believe how he manages without going to jail. His character should be a bit more redeeming to be entertaining.Fans of Back to the future franchise will enjoy this sequel forever, but if you usually don't enjoy cheesiness of classic films, you may find it just okay.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Bleak sequel to the sparkling original,"This is the most disappointing sequel I've seen since Living Free (sequel to Born Free). There is no energy, no commitment, nada. What a letdown. Did Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, et al. show up just because of contract requirements? I almost asked for my money back; now I wish I had. Thankfully, Back To the Future III was very good and revalidated the trilogy. I haven't seen such a depressing fantasy since Neverending Story. When filmmakers commit to a film as wonderfully entertaining as ""Back,"" anyone working on a followup should somehow be required to achieve something as joyously memorable.

Back to the Future Part II was almost as enjoyable as its predecessor,"Yesterday, my best friend and I rewatched this trilogy of Back to the Future in the movie theatre he works at. This second of the series took place partially on October 21, 2015-exactly the day we watched these again. We not only go to that day but also back to 1985-only it's now an alternate one caused by...well, watch if you don't know. We then also go back to 1955-where there are now two versions of the lead characters present. There aren't as much laughs but it's still fun to watch due to many chases. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are still enjoyable enough and seeing Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson reprise their roles as Lorraine McFly and Biff Tanen also added to the fun. So on that note, Back to the Future Part II is still a worthy sequel. P.S. Two actors were replaced for this and the next sequel: Jeffrey Weissman for Crispin Glover as Marty's dad due to a creative/salary dispute from the latter and Elizabeth Shue for Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer due to Ms. Wells temporarily quitting acting to care for her ailing mother.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

My favorite of the trilogy.,"As different as these movies are from each other, they represent probably the single most consistent and greatest trilogy of all time (Yes, better than those idiotic ""Star Wars"" movies!). ""Back to the Future  II"" is pretty insane, but it is simply hilarious, hilarious, hilarious....and fun, too. Whereas the first one tried to seem realistic in its fantasy, this one throws out all the logic and introspection with surprisingly excellent results. All the actors deliver great performances, especially Thomas F. Wilson, who portrays young Biff, middle-aged Biff, and old Biff so wonderfully that it's hard to believe it's the same actor. And the scene in which old Biff gives young Biff the sports almanac is one of the overlooked all-time classic scenes in cinema. One of the great things about this movie is that every little detail is devoted to hilarious mocking of economic and political situations. Pay careful attention to all of the newspaper headlines (""Nixon Seeks Fifth Term"" in alternate 1985; and Biff's success at the race track in the 1950s gets more space than Kruschev becoming Soviet premiere). Yeah, there are a ton of illogical flaws in the movie, but if you set that aside, you'll find it as entertaining as a movie can get.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"""You gotta come back with me...-Where?...-Back to the future","Back to the Future II is one of the cases where the sequel is equal or better than the original movie.

Well-constructed,"After the duo uselessly bring a recast(surprising, as everyone else returned) Jennifer(forcing them to reshoot the ending of Part I) to a pretty cool, futuristic 2015(where's my hoverboard? Those things rock) purely on account of her being in the car in that scene, 1985 gets a memorable dark twist on it and to rectify matters, Marty and Doc travel back to 1955. Again. Meaning there's now two pairs of them there. And we see several bits of the first in relation to this one, and it's really put together quite well. This is much more complex than the original(so if you haven't watched that one or it's been a while, refresh your memory before starting this one, or you'll be immensely confused), and it's also, a bit of the way, fanservice to it. And is anything wrong with that? If you're watching this, presumably you love that one, those are the people who wanted more, and this is one of those follow-ups that actually hold up(and in some ways, surpass their predecessor). It does have a bit of sequelitis going on, thinking that bigger is better, but most of the time, it proves itself right, because it never does go overboard. The 80's vibe is still very much present, and the humor tends to be silly(though there are definitely some clever lines and such, as well). Lloyd mugs, Fox annoys and entertains, and a lot of the acting is deliciously over the top. Biff is again the bad guy, and he is a fun foil for our hero. The FX are larger and more detailed, and the majority of the time, they look good. While no longer a high school comedy, this has the same tone of the '85 one. The climax is tense, the time travel is used well to create more plot, and the whole thing is exciting. There is some moderate to strong language in this.

"An Excellent,Unforgettable Sequel And A Classic.","Back To The Future Part II is an excellent and unforgettable sequel and classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a fantastic script,a terrific score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part II while not as good as the first film,a great sequel in the Back To The Future series.Set after the events in the first film,Back To The Future Part II finds Marty(Michael J. Fox)and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)time traveling to the future in 2015. When Marty and Doc return to 1985,they discover that Hill Valley in 1985 has become a dark wasteland thanks to Biff(Thomas F. Wilson)who took the time machine and altered 1985. Now,Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955,stop Biff and go back to their lives as they remember it.After the worldwide Box Office success of the original Back To The Future in 1985,it seem obvious that there would be a sequel which would come four years later with Back To The Future Part II a brilliant and entertaining sequel(which was filmed back to back with Part III)that was a Box office hit and is a film that is just memorable and fun from start to finish. Making a sequel to a classic film like Back To The Future is no easy task,but director Robert Zemeckis has crafted a movie that while giving viewers more of the same laughs,adventure and thrills like the original while also giving Back To The Future fans something that feels fresh and exciting at the same time standing on it's own two feet while being a sequel to the first movie. The Comedy and laughs in Back To The Future Part II are funny,hilarious and on par with the original and not a moment is wasted. The scenes with the iconic Deloren car(this time flying instead of driving)are still amazing and will keep viewers thrilled and entertained. The screenplay by Bob Gale is wonderful with dialog and scenes that make the movie feel alive and imaginative. Back To The Future Part II is a film that brings back some of the characters from the first film like Marty,Doc Biff,Loraine and others and takes the concept of time travel from the first movie and gives it a clever story line on a much larger and bigger scale playing with the very serious consequences and repercussions of time-traveling with Marty and Doc going to the future,the present and then the past showing that while time traveling can be fascinating and interesting time traveling can be dangerous if used in the wrong way with Marty and Doc finding out the hard way. When Marty and Doc travel to the future in 2015 to help with Marty's kids Hill Valley's future is optimistic and bright with advanced technology and flying cars while Marty's future isn't so bright. But when the duo go back to 1985 they discover that they are in an alternate Dystopian 1985 where violence and crime is up in Hill Valley and Biff is running the town. The scenes in the alternate 1985 give BTTF II a dark tone that is sinister showing that even the smallest events can change anything. I love the fact that in Part II that Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to repair 1985 as they remember it and as viewers we see some of the events from the first film showed in this one with some minor alterations. The story for BTTF PT II may have the most complex story of the three film but the movie won't be hard to follow. The ending of Back To The Future Part II is a terrific and memorable cliffhanger ending that has surprises and thrills which sets viewers up for the final chapter in the series in Back To The Future Part III. AN amazing ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant once again as Marty McFly(and multiple roles)and Doc Brown,with the two bring laughs and wonderful chemistry. Lea Thompson is terrific as Lorraine,Marty's Mother. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Biff and Griff,Biff's grandson. Elisabeth Shue(replacing Claudia Wells)is good as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. James Tolkan is great once again as Strickland,the hard nose teacher. Casey Siemazko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),J.J Cohen(Skinhead),Charles Fleischer(Terry)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by a young Elijah Wood as Video Game Boy.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is fantastic with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style he brought to the first film. Amazing direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding with Silvestri's score being epic and intense matching the movie greatly. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special effects by Industrial,Light and Magic are dazzling and mind blowing once again. Nice job,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis or the first film,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part II,an excellent and unforgettable sequel that will stay with you after you watch it.

Back...to the dance we've seen before,"Back in late 1989, Back to the Future Part II was one of the most expensive films ever made. Now that I've said that, let that set the tone of the film. The film is good-looking, and a lot of that comes from the budget, an estimated forty million dollars. And when I say good-looking, still seeing the futuristic Hill Valley today still looks amazing, even though it was 1989. The plot, on the other hand, relies on repeating the third act of the first film over again. But it has fun with it, so it's somewhat forgivable. But where the film really shines is in it's writing, especially with the one-liners, the long over-complicated speeches and warnings from Doc, and of course, Biff's screen door on a battleship line. While yes, the film is much weaker than the original, and it seems to take a little bit to get going, it's still a very visual sequel worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
1985 To 2015 Back To 1955 Again!,"Robert Zemekis returned to direct this entertaining sequel that sees Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox again) going 30 years into the future with Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd again as well) to stop his children from making bad decisions that will ruin their lives. After accomplishing this mission, they find to their horror that somehow, Biff Tannen(Thomas Wilson) had used the De Lorean to change the past, resulting in his being a rich and powerful man(he stole a sports almanac and gambled his way to success). Marty and Dr. Brown must put the time line back on the right track, and so go back to 1955 to prevent old Biff from giving young Biff the almanac, all the while avoiding contact with his own counterpart from the first film...Twist-laden sequel cleverly and effectively goes back into the first to integrate the overlapping characters and events, with surprisingly satisfying results.

The McFly family ties get even more complex in this well imagined sequel,"Upon revisiting Back To The Future Part II recently,it occurred to me that i have spent years thinking what a highly inferior sequel it was but having now seen it through new eyes, im happy to say that i feel as though i have been very harsh in holding that opinion for so long. Yes, there is only one first time with these things and the beauty of the first adventure was that we got to see Marty McFly interact with his parents when they were his age and the sheer brilliance of that idea was always going to be difficult for the creative minds behind this sequel to top. What they have come up with is a smart,complex weaving of overlapping time frames that keeps you as a viewer on your feet while riffing on many of the ideas from the first film. The trip in to the future is a sheer joy as we see 2015 (four years away), and the imagination and wit that has gone in to creating a not so distant future vision. The 'mcguffin' on this occasion, a future sports results book that falls in to the wrong hands and goes back to 1955, doesn't evoke the same fun as the McFly family ties, but the journey is one well worth taking and in the end you have to surrender to the energy and fun of this very well imagined and thought out sequel. It's a shame the excellent Crispin Glover doesn't return as George McFly but the rest of the cast all live up to previous performances and Zemeckis handles the complex structure with enviable skill.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...We all clamored for a sequel to ""Back to the Future"", and four years after the original film was released, we got one. In fact, we not only got ""Part II"", but highlights of a ""Part III"" to come were also shown - which was a smart marketing move, because ""Part II"" definitely leaves you hanging at the end. By today's standards, it might take a decade to get a sequel made, and we are okay with it. But, back then, if you waited for more than 2 years, you might have waited too long. Fortunately for us, everything that worked in the first film translated to this one without any problems.This 2nd entry into the trilogy picks right up where the 1st one left off, with Doc telling Marty and Jennifer that he needs their help in the future with their kids. Off they fly, into the future, leaving a couple of fire trails in the sky. Only, Biff witnesses the event and everything changes. In this film, we actually get to travel ahead in time to the future, and we are given a glimpse of what it could look like with outlandish outfits, hairstyles, and face make-up. In correcting one situation, Marty inadvertently creates a new one which alters everything in the past. Now they must return to the pivotal year of 1955 to make it all good again.Four years had passed since I had seen the first one. I was 16 when I saw it. This sequel was released late in the year in November, so I was already 21 when it came out. A lot had changed for me in that time span ... I was living on my own, engaged to be married, and employed full time. I was hoping they hadn't waited too long - and to my surprise, I really enjoyed this movie. The chemistry was still there, the movie magic was still there, and the overall feel of the first movie was also still there. In fact, to me, the only noticeable change was with Elisabeth Shue replacing Claudia Wells for the role of Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer.I highly recommend this movie. It is very strong and a fun rollercoaster ride through time. The storyline was fitting and kept you invested. It was a great nod to the original film, and set up the final one perfectly. I left the theater smiling and anticipating ""Part III"". This is a solid 8 stars out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The best of all 3,I liked this movie better than the other 2. People say they can't understand it so maybe they should pay more attention to it or go back to school cause when I first saw this at 7 in the theater I understood it perfectly so I have no idea why people don't understand it now. BTTF1 I liked but this one blew the first one away. It was well written and had a lot of special effects. This movie is perfect and as a matter of fact I think I'll bring out the tape and watch it all over again.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Leave your brain at the door, and enjoy it for what it's worth.","Back to the Future Part II reunites us with Doc and Marty McFly as they get up to more shenanigans. This time the story is of Marty McFly having to go into the year 2015 to correct his kids' wrong doings. But he makes a mistake and must go back to the year 1955 to prevent the mistake having a disastrous effect on 1985, without disturbing anything he did in the first one.I liked the first one, I also liked this one. I actually like this one more. The special effects are amazing and it's filled with ""how did they do that? When the hell did this film come out? The 80's? God damn that's amazing."" But for all its glorious sets and special effects there is few plot holes and lots of things which are just plain stupid. But to enjoy this film, you pretty much have to just shut off your brain.For the time it was great, and I'd imagine so many people were dazzled by the special effects that they didn't notice the stupidness that was all over it. Also, the acting could've been improved but aside from that. It's an enjoyable little film and you really just have to enjoy it for what it's worth.

"Some typical sequel problems, but overall a very good film","Back to the Future Part II picks up from the exact point where the original film left us, with Doc Brown coming to fetch Marty in order to take him into the future. And from that point we get an exhilarating story worthy of the first one. This is also the film that gave us most of those Back to the Future clichés and tropes, with hoverboards, self-tying shoes and ridiculous Jaws sequel banners. The future this film imagined was an awesome place, and even though the exact date they travelled to has already passed, it's still a fun to see what the 80s thought the next millennium was going to look like.It's also a great film in terms of keeping up what worked in the original. All the actors reprise their roles, and they're as talented, great and into it as before. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is still easily the biggest showstealer, but both Fox and Wilson give very good and suitably over the top performances as Marty and Biff, respectively, as well.The only problem I have with this film is the fact that it goes over much of the same ground that we already covered in the first film. In many cases we even go over the exact same scenes, only from slightly different perspective. They do it cleverly and I applaud them for their ingenuity, but it still means that we for the most part already know what's going to happen, which makes certain scenes boring to watch. It doesn't really ruin the film, but it was a nuisance, at least for me.But, overall, this is an amazing sequel, one of the best the industry has ever produced. It's fast, loose, filled with laughs and even though it doesn't quite capture the flow and grace of the original, it's still more than worth checking out. Far more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"""Manure! I hate manure!""","Back To The Future part II however, was a disappointment. A very clever and uniquely original disappointment, but a disappointment, nonetheless. The entire first act consists of a carbon copy of an entire sequence from the original, followed by one more sequence, just as an excuse to set up their second act return to 1985, to find everything completely different, and their yuppie suburb is now a ghetto, the hood.The entire second act is depressing, as was the intent, and is merely a set up for their return to 1955, again, in the third act.The film starts to come alive in its third act, as they must correct the mistakes in 1955, while trying not to do anything to interfere with their previous trip to 1955.Thomas Wilson's Biff Tannen gets the biggest laughs, while only a few chuckles were heard from the audience here and there. Sequel has a very imaginative and original plot, but it's just not fun, or funny.Before part II showed (again on Back To The Future day, 21 October 2015) a couple of mock ads were shown, one for a Hoverboard, and a trailer for the fictitious Jaws 19.

Not even 10% of the original's genius,"The original Back to the Future is a perfect movie. Brilliantly written, paced, acted, directed, and edited. There's never a dull moment, the story is great from start to finish, and the fantastical elements are never so far fetched as to break the suspension of disbelief.Not so with the sequel.Taken as a stand alone film, it's complex, very silly, but still entertaining. However, taken as a sequel to such a masterpiece, it's a borderline mess. The story is all over the place, needlessly complex, and incredibly silly. Michael J Fox plays himself and his kids in multiple ways, rendering several scenes as little more than ridiculous farce. The lack of the brilliant Crispin Glover as George McFly is obvious throughout too, with the various out of focus stand ins looking just awful. The movie also fails to build to any sort of climax, with it feeling throughout like a collection of random, often bizarre and unrelated sequences which seem to exist purely to show off prosthetic or split camera effects. Compared to the perfect storytelling and character arcs of the original, it's truly staggering that this script ever got approved.If for some reason you've never seen the Back to the Future films, just see the first and skip the awful sequels.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever Made Almost Matches The Original Back To The Future.,"1989's Back To The Future Part II happens to be one of my favorite movies the film almost matches the original Back To The Future in quality and popularity. This movie has it all drama, comedy and most of all the biggest adventure of your life a great thrill ride! BTTFP2 can become confusing to the viewer it like many films is one where you have to pay close attention you can't miss a minute also you must have saw the first Back To The Future to get any enjoyment and meaning out of this film. The film does a good job of showing how the future that of 2015 could look like at the time at first in 1989 those future inventions and creations seemed long away, but not now as we are in the year 2000. This film also flashes back to the first Back To The Future that's why BTTFP2 almost matches the original in quality and popularity. Along with the technique of flashback irony is present in the form of Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox's) travel back to 1955 once again just as in the first film only this time to change it back to the original 1985. So this is a sequel which repeats the original in many ways. Once again the acting is great Michael J. Fox as always gives a great performance he simply is one of Hollywood's greatest actors ever.Lea Thompson gives another good performance. Hey I could just go on and on in fact I have seen this movie about 75 to 100 times, just as much as the first Back To The Future. This film has ran for many years on the SCI-FI and USA cable networks and should continue to do so due to popularity. Simply put one of the best ever watch it again and again it seems to get better with age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Multiple Possibilities,"Like a good cliffhanger serial, the second story follows up smoothly with the first and broadens more of the world in the story.This film was one (or one of) the first ones that actually played with the concept of alternate possibilities as well as clever storytelling style by having it constantly moving to loop around back to the beginning. It's sort of the dictum sometimes when you go backward you go forward (or something like that. The special effects and sets are all top notch because their all practical, you can see they put a heck of a lot of effort into making it, as well as the painful process of construction and reconstruction, but all that pays off. It's cheerful and comical as usual however there is a dark overtone which makes the film take a bit of an unfun turn, but to me that just what makes the film more interesting and make me want the good guys to win because what happens in the film matters.The first act is a lot of fun where we see the future which looks straight out of pulp sci-fi, only it's a reality. It's a bright fun colorful cheerful future some aspects of it slightly prolific on what we have today. There are 80's cafes, hover boards, hollow graphic theaters, electric hover cars, attire that looks a little like 80's fashion only even more colorful, and other things. My favorite thing has always been the power laces, those things are awesome because I wouldn't have to stop and tie my shoes all the time, honestly who wants to and think of the amount of time it takes to do it. My favorite sequence of course is the hover board chase. But there is also a flip side of the coin to this, at the same time it's a slightly dark future because it also shows an America that has completely sold out to consumerism, big products, media, and technology. But the real darkness is when we see the grown up version of Marty, we see how one bad choice has not just made him look older than he really is but has taken away his dignity, musical ability, and reduced him to a brown noser.We then get to the second act when we see the alternate Hill Valley which is a very dark version of their present once Biff manipulates the past with information from the future for his own personal gain, and it's practically looks like Hell on Earth. It's a cesspool of crime and corruption, and there is one moment of dark discovery that made my heart sink. That moment along with seeing the older version of Marty showed how important choices we make in the present really are and they are never without consequences for the future.And of course the final act where we see them back in the same past as the original film. This was an interesting move which I don't see often let alone done well, what made it interesting was that we were seeing the movie in a different perspective this time which has been hidden away from us, sort of non linear story telling style like in ""Pulp Fiction"" or the TV show ""Lost"".If the film has a message is that the future truly is in our hands, it can be one way or another. But every decision we make must be made wisely because it will affect who we will become in the future as well as what kind we make for ourselves.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
This One Fires the Flux Capacitor 'Back' Up - Straight 'to the Future'!,"Back to the Future Part II begins where Part I left off, in 1985 at the Hill Valley home of teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, who is an absolute hoot in quintuple roles). Marty's scientist friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, back again in his signature performance), has just arrived with dire news of the future. So Marty and Doc settle back in the time-hopping DeLorean (you know, the one with the flux capacitor) and the new film skips ahead thirty years to 2015, to find Marty's son, Marty Jr., getting in some trouble with Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the grandson of Marty's 1955 nemesis Biff. This situation resolves itself fairly quickly, but not before old Biff steals the time machine to go back to 1955 and present his teenage self with a copy of a sports almanac that the young man uses to make himself a billionaire, turning 1985 into an altered hellish nightmare fantasy - Marty's dad is dead and Biff Tannen is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine. Marty and Doc, protected somehow from the effects of the change - though for how long, it's hard to say - head to 1955 themselves to stop Biff from changing the time-line. Naturally enough, this leads to both of them interacting, in potentially dangerous ways, with the plot of the first movie.It says quite a lot about director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale's enduring strengths that what I just wrote makes absolutely perfect sense while you're watching it. And that all the jerry-rigged elements concocted at the end of the movie harmonize rather effortlessly with the original, turning casual gags into clever foreshadowing and building recurring motifs out of one-liners, while also providing a fine story that hangs together and is perfectly effective on its own. It's in 2015 that most of the whiz-bang awesomeness of the movie is found, not just in the staggeringly over-detailed production design - skateboards are replaced by flying hover-boards, the Jaws series is up to number 19 and the Chicago Cubs finally win another series - but in Zemeckis' embrace of technological gewgaws. The film knows just how, and when, to entertain us, and it does so in spades.Zemeckis takes the sequel narrative and splices it into the intricate web of the first feature. The first two Back to the Futures ask a number of unresolved and unresolvable questions about causality, order, and intention; and taken as a pair, they're a hell of a lot of fun. That's what separates a top-drawer talent like Zemeckis from a routine hack: he can make an entertaining trifle meant to sell popcorn, and still infuse it with all kinds of structural inquiry.Back to the Future Part II is simultaneously an entertaining follow-up to Part I and a tantalizing introduction to Part III - a giddily and merrily mind-boggling sci-fi fantasy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

back and forth...back and forth,"The trilogy really got cool here, what with all the stuff about the altered time-line (and how the future would be an extrapolation of the screwed-up version of the present). Obviously, we've seen that the normal future won't exactly be what the movie portrays - they no doubt didn't foresee things like Bush's presidency or September 11 - but we've got some things that the movie didn't predict (like the Internet and iPods).All in all, ""Back to the Future Part II"" was probably the neatest installment in the trilogy. It's debatable about how necessary the third movie was. But anyway, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd turned in some great performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Genuinely exhilarating science fiction film, whose leaps in tone are handled well; whose characterisation is pleasing and whose sense of adventure is infectious.","I don't think that the first Back to the Future sequel is ultimately much more than an energising romp through the past; the then-present and the then distant future – an episode in the lives of certain characters during which they must spontaneously react to a predicament and shoot off to try and deal with it in whatever way they can, systematically hopping to and from various eras in the process to formulate an adventure. Indeed, the film's disconnection from the franchise's other two entries lies with the fact the time machine is as much a feature in Part II as anything else compared to the first and third films; the characters therein darting off to varying times on varying equilibriums as opposed to bedding down at a set date and allowing an adventure to play out. Furthermore, it is the only film in the series without a slam-bang finale consisting of racing against time (so to speak) with the potential peril of missing getting back to a specific year at stake – ending here on a cliff hanger merely teeing up the next entry, thus alluding to proceedings as 'filler' or as an entry detailing an episode or two instead of a rounded adventure. Regardless, the piece works rather well.The film kicks off following the conclusion of the first, the lead in Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and his newfound idyllic existence post-adventure with a functioning family; enthusiastic girlfriend Jennifer (Shue) and new vehicle shattered by the arrival of his long-standing partner in time Emmett Brown (Lloyd), nicknamed Doc. Doc arrives via the time machine in a frenzied and panicked manner; he has journeyed, as he said he would at the death of the first, far into the future and arrived back to inform Marty and his spouse-to-be that their future children are in big trouble. His outlining of the severity of the situation runs hand in hand with his erratic demeanour and frenzied actions, clearly in a state at the situation thus heightening tension. He speaks whilst systematically refuelling the time machine with household waste, inferring great time has to have been spent completely remodelling the contraption and its power source, a complicated procedure reiterating what a fantastic brain the man is in this respect.After being whisked away and thrust up into air, The Delorean now with the capability of flying, the opening credits greet us with a continual shot that resembles the perspective of an aeroplane's nosecone as it flies through the sky – a continual composition echoing that of the perspective those within the Delorean might see had the trips for those therein not been instantaneous. Arriving in 2015, Doc outlines Marty's mission in that frenzied manner; the arrival into an eerie new world and the highlighting of what's at stake doing well to further tension as it's established whom he's going up against is the 2015 equivalent to being ""a couple of beers short of a six-pack"", only here involving that of circuit boards. It's said the police and judicial systems work with brutal efficiency, but very little in the way of law is around to break up what is aggravated assault in a diner between Griff (Wilson), Biff's grandson, and Marty, which spills out into the streets and sees him pose as his son to try and quell a future jail term.The film begins in earnest when McFly buys a sports results booklet detailing who will win certain sporting events in the next several decades, for that when he journeys back to his present, he may earn a little extra cash. The idea is hit upon by Doc, demonised and then dismissed before Biff, now as an old man, emerges from the fire exit to a nearby establishment as if some kind of ghostly figure having overheard before taking it upon himself to deliver the book to himself as a youngster man through the Delorean's capabilities. He does so, 1985 Hill Valley eventually re-branded a Las Vegas-inspired, Civil war-torn iconography clad Hell in which Biff rules on high. Here, Biff is Marty's step-father and the consistent pulsating grinds out-poured by background power stations act as ambiguously diegetic sound effects whirring away, neatly capturing the horror of the situation Marty finds himself in; a situation poor Marty needs to have explained to him because ""they"" hit him on the head ""harder than usual"", this time.Thus begins all manner of rather enthralling hijinks, the film undercut with a real sense of both danger and horror as these people toy with time and end up in less than glamorous scenarios; the allure of time travel rife amidst these people and encapsulated in Marty's reaction to peering long-fully down an alleyway towards a busy street in 2015 Hill Valley, wanting to get amongst the residents of the world thirty years on but eventually brought down to Earth with what it is he experiences there-on. On one occasion, Jennifer ends up in her own home thirty years on; the presence of her future daughter mingling around in the background, and in the elevated position of upstairs, complied as if an unearthly creature milling around in a the background of a horror film sequence. Robert Zemeckis directs proceedings with a certain guile, taking the film to some pretty harrowing places on top of some goofy ones that encompasses horse feces and slapstick comedy; yet able to manoeuvre around when a change in tone is required and things become blacker, if more dangerous. Marty and Doc's adventures through the ages ultimately feels a little superficial, if well put together for what it is; but the flip side to this is that if said characters are those of whom we adorn as much as we do and whose company is so pleasing, then what's the problem with spending another 'x' number of hours-and-a-bit minutes in the presence of them and their madcap, rip-roaring misadventures through time and space? My answer: absolutely nothing whatsoever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Things might have gone well if that was all that he did however he has an idea to make a bit of money on his return by taking a book of future sports results back with him. Doc tells him to destroy the book but he leaves it it the DeLorean.

Marty confronts him and finds out that Biff had been given the future sports book by somebody claiming to be a relative back in 1955, using the results inside he had amassed a fortune. The only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 once more and retrieve the book before Biff can use it.I enjoyed the darker tone of this film although some of the special effects in the future scenes looked a bit ropey by today's standards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Great Movie,"I love this movie. My sole reason of leaving a comment tho is to reply to those who say that ""How can Marti and Jennifer have kids in the future cos they don't have when they leave 1985"" and ""When einstein goes back in time and appears a minute later he doesn't exist in that time, so if Marti and Jennifer leave in 1985 and arrive 30 years later then for 30 years they won't exist"". Umm how do you work that out?? Logically Marti and Jennifer have kids in 30 years time because before they go with Doc they have lived their life in the normal fashion. Yes Doc taking them to the future takes them away from 1985 and affects the timeline, but that doesn't really matter, all it means is that they don't end up how they were going to (ie a mess). But just cos Doc takes them away doesn't mean they don't exist for 30 years because eventually they do finally get back to 1985 and thus only didn't exist for short period of time (if at all - I can't remember if they come back before they leave or a short time after).

"Clever sequel is action-packed, but goofier and with a more complicated plot","Released in 1989, ""Back to the Future Part II"" stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen from 1985 who travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) on his time machine. When they return to 1985 they discover that an item was inadvertently taken from 2015 and brought to 1955, which changed history and made Hill Valley a dystopia. So they frantically venture back to 1955 to try to correct the problem. Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson play Marty's parents while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend, but she's asleep most of the movie.This is almost as good as the first movie, but the goofy tone of the first act throws it off, although it's action-packed. The next two acts are better as Marty & Doc go back in time and cleverly try to fix things. While the plot is way more complicated than the first film it's surprisingly easy to follow (Doc effectively explains the logistics in one scene). However, it's mandatory that you watch the first movie to fully appreciate this one.It can be argued that the movie was overly optimistic about the future (that is, 2015), but it was surprisingly accurate with some things, like video phones and, to some degree, hover-boards. But since the 'future' shown in the movie (2015) is a timeline manipulated by the protagonists it's an ALTERNATE reality and not necessarily the way things panned out in reality. It was Doc himself who invented the technology for flying automobiles since he already created the flying DeLorean in the first movie.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Oxnard, Monrovia, Arleta, Whittier, Baldwin Park, South Pasadena, Pasadena, Universal City and Los Angeles, California.

A worthy sequel to an outstanding classic.,"Back to the Future Part II continues right where the first movie left off, and it uses this starting point to bring protagonists Marty McFly and Doctor Emmet Brown into the 'future' of 2015. This future has flying cars, televisions in bars playing Michael Jackson and Max Headroom on the screens, and a cameo of a young Elijah Wood playing an arcade game.This film does admittedly show its age in certain areas (with this review being written in 2016), but damn is it still true to the sense of fun that the first Back to the Future film had, even if Part II directly borrows from it many times throughout the story. At least Part II utilizes new stories whilst honoring the first film at the same time.Part II is a very watchable film and has a lot of what made the first film great to begin with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
My fave flick of all time.,"The summary might sound a bit strange to you, and I agree this ain't the best picture ever. But it sure as hell is my favourite. This was a also one of the first films I remember watching However, I hadn't seen the first Back To The Future film, so of course I didn't understand a goddamn thing, but it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. And I doubt you can blame me: time machines, hover boards and dehydrated pizzas. Can it possibly get any better than that?!Michael J. Fox became my biggest hero and I will always love this movie more than anything.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not possible,"I love the back to the future trilogy,but when this was written did nobody think that if Marty leaves the present to visit himself in the future, there won't be a future Marty because he left the present time.....I am actually watching this right now and I love it. I just thought some logical thinking was left out while writing, although I think it would come up. I am a 15 year old and I even caught this snag. I do think it is an awesome movie just that part is not logical in any way. And I only keep restating the same thing because I have to have 10 lines of a review, even though I only wanted to make that one point.

A great movie,"This sequel is very derivative of the first one but it also does a great job of expanding with the same formula.

Watch the first movie before giving this one a try,"Despite the fact that I've never been a fan of Sci-Fi movies, I've always loved ""Back to the Future"". Only a couple of weeks ago I watched the first movie in the series again and I still liked it as much as I did when I first saw it. Now the second part was shown on television and I was curious about the fact whether I would like the sequel as much as the original version. Normally I don't like sequels all that much because they don't add anything to the story, but this movie is different...The second part of the ""Back to the Future""-movies picks up where the first one ended as we see how Doc suddenly comes back from the future and asks Marty and Jennifer to come with him to 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. After doing so, they return to their own time, discovering that something has drastically changed in their neighborhood. Violence, murder, gambling,... have become common practice in the once so quiet neighborhood. This happened because in 2015 Biff Tannen stole the Delorean, taking with him a book with the results of every sports event from the 1950's till 2000. He gave it to his younger version in the fifties, using it to become incredibly rich. In order to restore the present, Marty and Doc will have to return to 1955 so they can retrieve the book...Despite the fact that I feared that this would be an easy way of making even more money out of the success of the first movie, I must admit that this isn't really the case. Not only have they added the element of the future and the changed present, they have also added a new part to what happened in the first film. It's true that they have re-used several parts from that first movie, but it's never boring to watch, because they have always used another point of view, instead of just using the same footage. If they hadn't done that, I would probably not have liked it a bit, but now I did.Once again the acting in this movie was more than OK. The performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd weren't any different from those in the first movie and since I already liked them in that movie, I can only say that I liked them in this one as well. But the other actors like for instance Elisabeth Shue, who got a much bigger role in this movie, were also very good.All in all this is a very worthy sequel which makes me look forward to the last and final part. The still interesting story, the many new features, the good acting,... make this movie look a lot better than the average sequel. Perhaps interesting to know is that you should have seen the first movie in order to fully understand the second one. That's not always the case with sequels, but with this one it is. I liked that and I liked many other things as well and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Childhood Favourite,"Love all of these movies, loved them from a child, could probably recite the whole film backwards. Gotta make a new one, or that may not be the best idea ever. I hope they start to make more movies like these, great entertainment that you could watch over and over and over again. Perfect for the whole family. Epic piece of film making history. Even the effects were brilliant for its day where they were not as advanced as they are now. Films have come a long long way since then, but sometimes you just don't feel as visually and emotionally rewarded from some of the big flicks nowadays. Seems that all the money in the world can't substitute for a poor script or story plot.

Best in the Series,Marty and the Doc go to 2015 to save Marty's kids from ruining their lives. Biff gets a Sports Almanac for the years 1950-2000 and steals the Delorian and gives the almanac to himself in 1955.  When Marty and the Doc get back to 1985 they find it has changed into a massive hellhole due to the fact that Biff has changed the events of time using the almanac.  Now Marty and the Doc must once again travel to 1955 and grab the Almanac from Biff before he puts it to use.  Back to the Future: part 2 has the best ideas out of the entire series.  The movie covers multiple time periods and it is just a lot of fun.  The acting is top notch.  Most of the original cast is back.  The sets are amazing.

Back to the Future Part II (1989) Exploring the future,"The sequel to Back to the Future seeks to explore a different theme than the previous one. Here we are introduced to the future of this universe and the causes that a change in the past can cause. The most iconic moments are precisely when the film explores these different realities of that story. The film shines when it seeks to present different visuals throughout the narrative. The difference from one reality to another is very visible and the whole atmosphere becomes different. However, the film, at various times, tries to recreate scenes from the previous one to generate nostalgia and comical scenes. Often the humorous scenes that use what worked in the previous film are creative and effective, but the film seems to become hostage to this technique for many moments and becomes repetitive. Still, the narrative has its own personality and has the ability to be completely independent, even if at different times it seems to stick to everything that worked in the previous one and just replicate it to work again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Good movies,"I like 'The Back to the Future series' very much.  Interesting story about time travel, with lots of funny stuff inside to make them great comedy in addition as scientific fiction.  Every time when you re-watch it you will find some more about the plot used to contrast/correspond different times at 1955/1985/2015.As a film made 5 years after BTTF 1, I wonder how it can relate so closely with it, even at the little parts.However, I just think of one goof with the movies: in 2015 old Biff took the time machine and travelled back to 1955 and gave the Sport Almanc to young Biff at that time.  Then the timeline should split to the alternate version (which cause Marty and Doc came back to the dark Hill Valley in 1985). Then why Biff can come back to 2015, where the timeline version was the same as the one he left.  According to the theory of Doc, Biff should also be a rich man in 2015.Maybe this is the only way Marty and Doc could get back the time machine and have the story continued.Anyway, I like the spirit that brought by the BTTF series: future is in your hands and you are able to change it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Awesome Sequel,"I know this may get a lot of flack, but I actually like this movie more than the first one. Now don't get me wrong, the first one is a BETTER FILM. It is objectively better than this movie, but man this one is just so much fun.OK, yes, some of the special effects didn't age well, and some errors between this and the first film may exist. Plus why is the daughter played by Micheal J. Fox, wouldn't it make more sense to have the actress playing Jennifer play the daughter.But man this movie is fun, it completely takes full advantage of the idea of time travel. Having alternate timelines, going both back and forward, and making the future, a future that isn't bleak and depressing. The future is just plain awesome, overblown in the way people dress, but awesome. The hoverboard chase scene in my opinion is even better than the skateboard chase in the first film. It has some pretty damn great effects for the time. I still can't believe that putting Micheal J. Fox as three people in the same shot was possible in 1989. It's still extremely funny, and I like how dark it gets in the second half.Is the first film technically better, yes it is, but I enjoy this movie more, it takes full advantage of it's time travel premise, and is just a lot of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

The past and the future could be in jeopardy. Watching this sequel is fun and gives many reason why interfering with time is not such a good idea.,"Although it is not as good as the original movie in my view, the sequel Back To The Future II' is a movie that fans of the genre will always enjoy. What is fun about this movie is how totally crazy that the whole idea behind it really was. However it is also interesting to once again visit the classic story that the two Bobs have been made famous for writing. There are other interesting aspects to this film, but if I tell you too much too soon, we might do some irreparable damage to the space time continuum'.Brace yourself  as the most spectacular history-altering adventure of all time continues. Marty and Doc Brown have barely recovered from their first time-travelling adventure when they launch themselves once more into the space time continuum. But this time around, their history-tweaking antics in the year 2015 create a frightful, alternate 1985 Hill Valley where bully Biff Tannen is rich, powerful and Marty's Dad! Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again. But can Doc and Marty patch up the past without igniting a universe-shredding time paradox?What is most impressive about the second of the BTTF films is the story that was thought up by Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Many sequels are entirely different sorts of movies, but in this one, the writing pair have cashed in on what was successful in the first and cleverly integrated that into the second. If I was to tell you what the main parts to the story were, it would get both of us very confused.Another remarkable part to this movie is the way the future is presented here. The movie partly takes place in 2015, so I am sure back in the 1980s, the ideas of what the future would be like in the new millennium were quite outrageous. Yet for a film such as this they are the perfect ideas to present. Of the changes to Marty's home town Hill Valley in 2015, they include vehicles which can fly through the sky and kids who have skateboards that operate as hovercrafts'. In fact the movies special effect highlights include all of the scenes with these hovercrafts', with Marty evading a bad gang in the centre of Hill Valley.Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) are back in very entertaining roles. Fox takes on more than the role of 17 year old Marty McFly from 1985. He is also his son Marty Jnr., the older Marty (the father of the family) and his daughter Marlene. Fox commented that the process of being the many different characters was an arduous task, but one that makes the whole BTTF experience worth it. Yet the standout role in BTTF 2 has to be Lloyd, who as the Doc has many headaches when he goes from the future, the present and the past. He is breathless as he flies about trying to repair the damage that is caused to the space time continuum'. Many times I had to laugh as the Doc is rambling on about what chaos has been caused by the latest disaster.There are other reprising roles that are most noteworthy in BTTF 2. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is back, as is his older version in the year 2015, along with his grandson Griff, who is as much a butthead' as his grandfather was at his age. In fact going back to see Biff as a billionaire and a teenager was even more enjoyable this time around, as he is the tough guy that Marty McFly does not like. There is also Marty's mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), who is very old in 2015 and placed into a horrible life when the present is ruined by her son. I feel that she was a great choice for this role and I am glad she came back. A new actor to the cast is Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas star Elizabeth Shue, who is Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer. Her role in the movie is funny as she is taken on a ride that will show her future.Being behind the scenes of this movie must have been a nightmare, as you would not have known where you were from one day to the next. Perhaps that is the reason that this movie would have been so much fun to work on. I like what this movie points out about the past and the future. It shows you can go into the future and straighten out what little idiosyncrasy that you or your family might have. But it also shows what damage can be caused to the present, when one mistake is made. Back To The Future II' might not be as classy as the original movie, but what it lacks it in originality, it makes up with in comedy and humour.  With that in mind, fans of the series would have to be happy with a most satisfying of sequels.CMRS gives Back To The Future II': 4 (Very Good Film)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Back to the Future vs Star Wars,"I really enjoyed Back to the Future Part I, but after watching Part II for 30 minutes I could see that it didn't match the success of its predecessor.

After a while all the coming and going through time became quite convoluted. The ""too be concluded..."" ending to Part II was also disappointing. Don't think I'll bother watching Part III...I read a review a while ago suggesting that the Back to the Future trilogy was better than the Star Wars trilogy.

From the auto tying shoes, to the hoverboard, this sequence was just so ahead of its time and is still a blast to watch today. Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's bond is without a doubt one of the greatest film duos ever created, and as if they didn't entertain us enough in first film, the second instalment only shows us more of their quirky and fun relationship, providing plenty of laughs along the way.

Fax machines in 2014 were too funny!!,"This sequel of the superb ""Back To The Future"" is a very earnest attempt to follow a winning formula up with a truly worthwhile effort in this sequel. Complex, yes, but interesting. Unfortunately, at times it gets a bit too mechanically contrived with the time sequence derivations, and I find myself mentally checking the continuity which detracts from the theme. Nevertheless, if you liked the first ""Back To The Future"" you will probably enjoy this movie. All the characters are present from the original and they are playing multiple generations almost simultaneously. The basic plot has them going to the future, to the past, and to an alternative present, which makes for a very varied set of locations to work with, even though it's technically the same area. And you get to see different versions of the characters in different circumstances. It makes for some really fun storytelling situations.Really, overall, I quite enjoyed watching this movie. I'd daresay it's actually improved with age, even in spite of it's recent resurgence in popular culture considering the time-line in which the future portions of the film occur in.

Is This What The Future Will Look Like?,"Firstly, let me say that no-one should watch this film unless they have seen the first one. If you do you just won't understand it-I remember a friend of mine watching this film once without watching the original and he couldn't figure it out.In the original, Marty McFly end up in 1955 and set off a sequence of events that threatened his existence. Of course he got back to 1985 at the end of the film.In this movie he travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd in a role worthy of an award). I won't spoil the plot but let's just say that he's off to perform a routine task in 2015 but one thing after another happens and just like in the original, the ""fabric of time is threatened"" (Doc's words, not mine-I'm no scientist). So Doc and Marty have to race through time putting things right and having a hard time doing it.Just like the first, there is plenty of humour and action and all the cast are playing their roles great; they look like they're really enjoying themselves.When I first watched this film in 1989 I thought the vision of the future in 2015 was quite cool-it was just how I'd imagine the future to be.

A Skewed Look at the Future,"Thomas F Wilson becomes a more central character in this movie. That is because Biff is in a lot of the action. The film starts with Doc Brown transporting Marty & his girlfriend Jennifer to the future. Once there, Jennifer is drugged & out of the way for most of the time.Doc wants Marty to rescue Marty's son from certain disaster. This film, shot at the same time as part 3, is actually more of a bridge from 1 to 3. It introduces a lot of the themes that would complete the saga. Biff is in the movie as old Biff & young Biff & young adult playboy Biff.While Wilson does a good job playing Biff, he is portrayed as stupid in every time zone. No matter what Biff does, things don't turn out well for him. Overall, the use of flashbacks is clever and it can hold an audience, but because of all the plot devices introduced, the film is kind of like a rest stop between the 2 action films, parts 1 & 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Tedious Rehash,"This sequel is seriously overrated. It is truly remarkable how little effort was put in and yet the creators seem to have got away with it as far as audiences are concerned.The writing isn't just poor - it's mind-numbingly stupid. Stupid enough to be written by Biff, the insipid caricature villain from the first film that the creators saw fit to reuse, despite his complete lack of appeal. What happens to him, like every character in this tedious mess, is more or less exactly the same as in the first movie, but minus the charm or surprise.The performances are dreadful. Michael J Fox is remembered fondly, which in retrospect is quite amazing given this second absurdly childish run as McFly, who proves to be one of the most empty and feckless protagonists in all cinema.It is a shame given the possibilities the universe of the first film presents. The Back to the Future Virtual Reality ride at Universal Studios had infinitely more creative merit and imagination than this film.At no point are there any stakes. The film gives you no reason to care about anything that happens, as everything amounts to basically several hours slapstick farce without being funny.What a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

BETTER THAN THE FIRST!,"I know that everyone says that the first one is the most iconic than the second and the third. I agree. But the second back to the future is really better! It has a better story, it's more thrilling and more fun! It's just more entertaining and enjoyable than the first one. The third is really just a nuh-uh, cause it is a total garbage comparing it to the first two. The third one does a pretty good job ending the story but it's not really good. And the second is fun in the 2000, cause the future thing sets in somewhere in 2020-2030 so it's nowadays pretty fun. And it's somehow a bit thrilling. If you have watched the first, you can not say anything to not watch the second one. A MUST WATCH!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
It's a good movie if you don't mind the Giant plot holes,"If Marty and Jennifer left in 1985 to go to 2015, it would not be possible for both Jennifer and Marty to exist in 2015 since Biff mentioned he never seen a Delorean for 15 years. This means Marty and Jennifer just changed the timeline. The other problem, but not a serious plot hole is him giving the Almanac to his younger self in 1955, which a future has changed, the old Biff should disappeared or something. One exception of not changing the future if going to the future is to view Marty and Jennifer of the future, without physically going there would not have that effect. The original Time Machine movie the man left in a time machine and he was not there in the future, and this made sense. Nevertheless. Back of the Future II is my all time favorite, because of it's intriguing plots concerning changing the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"""I don't understand one damn thing that's going on.""","While it does fairly well for itself on the IMDb, I've found BTTF II to be regarded as the weakest link in some quarters.I'd put this down to its complex narrative, which confuses some and leaves others cold. A shame, as it's my favourite of the series, brimming with constant invention. Many of the delights of the film come from futuristic devices you just wish were real: hover skateboards, self-lacing boots and auto-drying clothes. The movie somehow, inexplicably, has the power to draw you into its experiences. You might not be able to ride a hoverboard, but this is the next best thing.Some brilliant in-jokes are pitched in Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's direction: a holographic Jaws 19 is dismissed by Marty as ""still looks fake"", while pal Michael Jackson gets a Max Headroom makeover. This is the sort of film where it's almost impossible to get bored, there's simply always something to see, and the pace never lets up. Michael J. Fox is as likeable as always in the lead role, while Thomas F. Wilson clearly enjoys going over the top in his dual parts.Apart from some product placement this really is a harmless, superb entertainment, and while some of the sports references - the Cubs winning the world series - mean little outside America, the principle of using time to cheat at gambling is a universally understood one. If there's a genuine complaint then it's that the series misses the presence of Crispin Glover, and that Lea Thompson gives a weak performance, though this is more than made up for by the multiple roles Fox gets to play. His five parts include his future self, plus his own son and daughter! And while some of the flying car effects may look a tad dated now (though only just), the split screen elements are flawless.There are some plotholes to mix in with the fun timeshifting - if Biff created an alternate timeline in the past then the future he returned to wouldn't have been the same one occupied by Marty and the Doc - but are irrelevant among all the fun and imagination of this superior sequel. While it may not be high art, BTTF II does some wonderful things with the medium, and breaches film excellence with a final third that seamlessly blends in the action to events in the first film. In fact, I nearly added another mark to its total... 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Sequel lacks the heart of the original, but still has the fun","The original ""Back to the Future"" film was a hit with my kids during one of their ""Film Appreciation"" family movie viewings and this sequel was also well received, though they were confused at times with all of the time travel lines crossing one another. I enjoyed rewatching the film, but my main complaint is that this sequel lacks the heart of the original film and was overly plot driven. It's still funny, suspenseful, and exciting, but it didn't have the innocent charms of the original. For that reason, it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's still well worth watching. FUN FACT! According ""Back to the Future Park II"" writer Bob Gale, adult Biff Tannen and his gaudy casino filled with portraits of himself was based on Donald Trump.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Ignore the plot holes (and enjoy!),"I know that the original 'Back to the Future' film was 'lightning in a bottle' (or should that be 'Flex Capacitor?') and its sheer charm and mass appeal could never truly be recaptured. Therefore 'Part II' was always going to have a hard job when it came to competing. I was only twelve when it was released and, in short, I loved it. However, even back then long before the days of internet message boards and Twitter, I remember picking up on the mutterings from film critics about how it wasn't a patch on the original. Now, I'm not about to commit blasphemy and tell you that it is. I'm just saying that it's a great, fun film and it continues the story just perfectly.Sequels that outdo their original are few and far between, but this one does have enough memorable moments to really hold their own over time and remain in the public's consciousness, even today (Marty's 'self-lacing' Nike trainers, anyone?). If ever a story picked off where the last one left off, it was 'Back to the Future Part II.' Who among us wasn't dying to know where Marty and Doc were going to next and the sight of our favourite time-travelling car flying off into our faces only filled us with intrigue. And, when they arrive in the 'future,' or at least 2015 as was depicted back in the 80s, it's filled with weird and wonderful gadgets (which - naturally - are still waaay off where we are today, technologically). Marty has to prevent an incident in his son's future that will bring down his family-life to come. naturally, not everything goes to plan and he and Doc are forced to zip back and forth through time in order to correct things. And, like I say, I loved it then and I still do.However, that's just my opinion and I think it's fair to address some of the criticisms it's picked up then and now. Some people resent a few casting changes that occurred between films, others say that the future is too over-the-top, plus it retreads old ground (sometimes remaking scenes deliberately in homage to its own predecessor), but without any of the charm and others resent the way it ends (I should warn you that it's designed to be a 'middle film,' therefore I'm guessing the film-makers had no plans to end the story with Part II.Personally, I didn't mind and of that. If I could nit-pick one single thing it would be something I note now about the story-telling 'suspension of disbelief' which seems to go hand in hand with all time travel movies. Namely something happens which causes 'time' to spew off in a different direction, but, due to the paradox this would actually cause, the plot falls apart on a plot hole. However, I didn't notice that when I was younger and I'm sure not going to let it ruin my enjoyment of the film now.There are few movies nowadays that the whole family can sit down and enjoy (okay, maybe 'Ready Player One' will be one day), but, right now, all three 'Back to the Future' movies deserve their place in cinematic history. Watch it now before it gets remade!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"It Was Finally Our Year, a Cubs Anthem","Chicago Cubs fans across the nation clutched their copies of Back to the Future Part II when it looked like our Cubbies might make the film's World Series prophecy come true last October. The vision the film predicted didn't happen, of course, and we are all still perpetually humming ""there's always next year"". It's hard to believe this Cubs fan neglected to see this movie last year as I kept hearing ""We're going to do it, it's in Back to the Future"". All Cubs fandom aside, this was a great film to see, and I'm glad I can finally add it to the list of classics that I have seen, even if I waited too long.Back to the Future Part II reunites our unstoppable team of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a journey to save Marty and his now girlfriend/future wife Jennifer's (Elizabeth Shue) children. Doc crashes, literally, the reunion between the two teen lovers after Marty's first trip through time with harrowing news. Doc informs the lovebirds that they marry in the future, which thrills them, but then informs them that there is a serious problem with the lives of their future children, and Marty's help is needed to thwart their futures. Doc has painstakingly worked through each moment in Marty McFly Jr.'s life and realized the moment that he went off track, October 21st, 2015. All that he needs is for Marty to intervene, act as his son and confront the bully that pushes him into the less than desirable situation and his life will be fine. A simple enough proposal, which of course doesn't work out the way Doc had planned. Marty gets greedy and buys a sports almanac to take with him to the past with the idea that he will place bets on all the winners and become rich. Doc vehemently disregards this idea and puts Marty in his place, morally. Unfortunately for the world, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) finds the almanac, discovers the DeLorean doubling as a time machine, and travels back to 1955, where Marty just left and gives the book to a relative with a less prominent moral compass. Unbeknownst are Biff's travels to Doc and Marty who travel back to 1985 to find their home in a depressing state, and their own lives in complete disarray. To reverse the curse, Doc comes up with a plan to send he and Marty back to 1955 so Marty can take to book from Griff (Thomas F. Wilson), the complicated part of this plan is to not disrupt the initial journey Marty took to 1955. Since time is a continuum, Marty's first trip to 1955 is taking place just the same as it did before, so it becomes imperative for neither Marty nor Doc to see their past/future selves and prevent further disaster. Watching the duo glide through time on an ever evolving mission to save themselves and humanity was just as enjoyable to watch in this sequel as it was in the original film. One can't wait to see what happens next, as the end of the film guarantees we will see the team again.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd look just as comfortable and believable in this story as they did in the first. It was fun to see their chemistry and watch them think up their plots then set them in motion throughout the film. The adaptability of the two actors shows their versatility and comes off so naturally for the audience. There are, of course, supporting actors in this film, but most of the film takes place with just these two on screen so chemistry is crucial, and was achieved in this film to optimal level.The overarching moral lesson in Back to the Future Part II is pretty clear; don't cheat the world just to make a buck, or, millions upon millions of bucks in Marty's ideal situation. Doc was right to dissuade Marty from taking the sports almanac with him to 1985, even if some of us may have cheered Marty's idea. One should not take advantage of invention and use it for personal gain. This can be thought of more deeply in everyday life as well. This message definitely makes one think about their position in life and the potential of privilege associated with that position. Doc also reminds us in this film, as he did in the first film, that one should not know too much about their own future. He remains steadfast in the idea that we shouldn't be privy to what will happen in our own lives in the future. This is a great reminder for humanity to embrace the unknown. Life is all we are guaranteed once we're here and we may as well make the most of the mystery that we get to see unfold.Back to the Future Part II is a fun and engaging film suitable for the whole family. I miss the movies of the 80's that drew the teenage crowd but could still be enjoyed with your parents on the couch Sunday evening. A good lesson and a great story make for an enjoyable film experience. I will certainly be tuning in to the third installment of this series and hope it will be as enjoyable as the first two. I'm still waiting for a movie that doesn't show such a ghastly future with crazy fashions and hair, but I suppose, everything looked ghastly at one point or another.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Biff was actually the smart one...,"I decided to watch all three of these recently, and realized that I clearly had forgotten how problematic (and annoying) the two sequels were.One of the things that made the first movie so good was that, generally speaking, Marty was constantly out-thinking everyone around him. In short, he was the clever one. In re-watching the series again, I realized that I must have not paid much attention when watching the two sequels (eons ago), because Marty is written as being a total moron in the sequels, continuously ignoring what he has been told to do, and continuously being too stupid to avoid (obvious) problematic situations, such that everything that goes wrong (repeatedly) is just the result of his ridiculously low IQ.I really do feel like the first film is enjoyably re-watchable, because Marty is the clever one, and drives the plot forward with his actions. I am clueless as to why they seemed to have lobotomized his character in both the sequels, because it reduces them both to just being seriously frustrating viewings. I certainly doubt that I'll ever watch either of them again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie!,"I love all three of the ""Back to the Future"" movies.  I used to dislike this one when I was young, because I didn't like Biff being rich & powerful.

IS IT BACK TO THE FUTURE OR AHEAD TO THE PAST?,"I was somewhat disappointed with  ""Back To The Future, Part 2"" because of the producer/director's vision of the future. Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) lives in a sinister, darker world in the 21st Century. Marty has been reduced to a fumbling, bumbling idiot. What happened to the clever, thinks fast on his feet Marty Mcfly?  Biff was a bully for sure in the 1950""s. He becomes ugly and too over the top evil in part 2.  Doc Brown is the only main character who stays pretty much the same. Sure, change is refreshing and needed, but the script takes the characters too far. Part 1 has many classic scenes that become iconic. The clever writing is history in part 2. It was also confusing at times to follow the back and forth time travel. Marty and Doc go back to 1955 again, but they have to be careful not to meet Marty and Doc from 1985, who went back to 1955 originally. Also, old Biff goes back to 1955 to talk to young Biff. Marty and Doc have to be careful not to be spotted by young Biff, or old Biff, and old Biff must return to the 21st Century before he is ""caught"" by Marty and Doc- who are in the future to see old Marty and Doc. WHEW!! Just a little bit too twisted and too busy. They gave it a nice try, but one classic is all this trilogy had in it. ""Back To The Future"" , part 1 was ahead of its' time.

Well, this is impossible... because... when Marty travels into the future with his girlfriend they skip time and they cant see an old version about theirselves in the future cause the werent there for thirty years. Perhaps you say think 'well... time travell is just a fantasy and in this movie its possible...' well! that is not true! In the first movie the doc explains how time travelling works, he shows how his dog einstein is send one minute into the future. Well, during that minute, he was not there.

#1.,"This has been and always will be my favorite out of the trilogy. First, they went to a future that looked much like the pretty cool 30 years later. The Cubs won the World Series, they still have newspapers, everything seems hopeful and optimistic about the future. It looks like everything is going fine until Marty bought that damn book.

Back to the Future Part II has some fun concepts that are worth your time but is missing the charm of the first film.,"My daughter and I recently watched Back to the Future Part II (1989) on Netflix. The storyline follows Marty and Doc as they travel to the future to save their future lives and children. However, when they return home, they unknowingly bring someone back with them, which disrupts their original journey from Back to the Future. Can Marty and Doc defeat their new nemesis and reset the fabric of time so that Marty's life and family are relatively normal?Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump), Back to the Future Part II stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (The Addams Family), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Elisabeth Shue (Adventures in Babysitting), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).This is one of those movies with a bunch of cool ideas, but I'm not sure they're executed as well as they could be. As a kid, I loved this movie for its futuristic sneakers, toys, cars, and the depiction of the town from the first film. Marty and Doc remain charismatic characters who are easy to root for. Lea Thompson and Elisabeth Shue are gorgeous in this picture and make for fun side characters. While Biff's evolution might be a bit over the top, it's a clever twist in the plot. However, I'm not sure we needed the story to revisit the big night from the first film-this premise seemed a bit overdone and cheesy. This is one of those films that you realize was good because of when you watched it but is not as good as it could have been.In conclusion, Back to the Future Part II has some fun concepts that are worth your time but is missing the charm of the first film.

An actually good sequel...,"Being a big fan of the original, I was quite happy with this sequel. The intrigue of time travel into the future is one of the biggest allures for science fiction, and Part 2 makes it look very clean and fun. Granted, there are some major plot holes that result from the ""cause and effect"" paradox of time travel, but for the sake of entertainment, we have to push that away. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fun the second time around, with the continuum of time at stake this time. After journeying into the future, they discover they have to go back and fix the past again - the 1955 that they'd already visited. The movie is fun, fancy, and it keeps you hooked to the end. I don't know what problem the critics had with this one; I liked it, because it took the spirit of the first one, and transformed it into a dynamic story, enjoyable action scenes, and respectable dialogue. Not to mention the special effects were very well done for the time-frame of the film. If you liked the first one, you will like the sequel.

A BLAST!,"When I first saw this I didnt really like it that much.  There was too much going on and it didnt make much sense.  But once this hit video and I had a chance to watch it a couple of more times, I realised what a truly impressive film it is.  Zemeckis and Gale are geniuses!  This zips along at a breathtaking pace and doesn't let up for second.  The effects are superb, it's very funny most of the time, but it isn't afraid to be very dark in places.  One thing I really like is that Zemeckis and Gale actually credit the audience with having some intelligence, whereas most fantasy films these days only require the IQ of a 5 year old to understand.HOWEVER one thing thats always bothered me about this is why does Marty meet his future self when they go to 2015?  In the first one Einstein disappears when he goes into the future and Doc and Marty live those seconds without him, so surely when Doc and Marty travel into the future the rest of the world should have gone on without them and they would have been reported missing in 1985?  Alternate time line you say, but when is it ever stated that by simply travelling through time you enter a different reality. Fair enough if you go back in time and alter the past and then go forward again things might have changed, but if you are travelling on a straight line forward you shouldnt be able to meet yourself.Aaahhh!

"Fun, but not quite as good as the rest","The move had a good connection to the original ""Back to the Future"" movie, the movie got a little slow in parts when you compare it with the other movies in the trilogy. I did like their future situation alongside the past situations. But since it has already past 2015 and I am still waiting to see anything close to a flying car, let alone a hover-board item that actually hovers above the ground, instead of something that runs more like a stupid Power Wheels product, the situation does make you question if that will even have a chance to happen.The 2015 part was rather ironic when they saw Arnold Schwarzenegger having been President, when they weren't that far-off after his roll as the Governor of California. Today, it almost makes you wonder if this movie had a part in Schwarzenegger's original inspiration for running to be California's governor.This movie does get a little slow in a few scenes; most of which were the beginning scenes in his trip back to Biff's modified 1985, parts in Marty's correcting trip back into 1955 were somewhat slow too, but (as Marty explains while knocking out Biff) ""Back to the Future II"" is still a ""fun"" movie to watch.

Worthy sequel to all-time classic,"Though not as good as #1 by any means, this is definitely a worthwhile sequel. Fox and Lloyd both reprise their characters, and do just as good a job as in the first. Biff is without a doubt one of the most easily hated film characters of all time, and he's worse than ever this time around. The plot is ingeniously complex, though that makes it hard to follow at times. I love how it ties in with Part 1 so incredibly well, the writers did a great job. Zemeckis's directing was pretty cool in some parts as well. Overall, this is a pretty good sequel to an all-time classic.

Great part two,"The only reason I rate this film a 7 compared to the other 2 films in this franchise is that it does play out a little long. That minor nitpick aside, I thought this was a great entry in the franchise and setup the third act of the franchise much like Empire did for the original Star Wars trilogy.The themes and characters are a lot darker this go around. We seen the consequence of messing with time. Everyone from the first film is back save for Glover and all again give us great performances. This one doesn't seem to get the play on TV like 1 and 3 do, but I think that is because it plays out like a true 2nd act should with the end leaving you hanging.

The high point in a brilliant time jumping trilogy.,"Taking up immediately after the events of the original – and I mean immediately, it even repeats the closing minutes and segues straight into the action – BttF 2 uses the core structure of the first film and brilliantly builds the sequel around, over and quite literally through the first, but somehow manages to stand alone as its own movie. (I would like to hear if someone has seen 2 and not the original, and what they thought.) Within minutes Doc, Marty and Jennifer are in 2015 in the now flying DeLorean, a future which just 4 years away from now seems to promise far more than I think we'll see as the 2014 calendar ticks over; flying cars and hovering neon signs to name but two things.In this sequel which covers three distinct time periods, 1955, 1985 and 2015 Marty, Doc and Jennifer – but mainly Marty and Doc – must save Marty and Jennifer's as yet unborn kids from less than ideal fates, whilst once again warding off members of the 'Biff' family, including the now elderly Biff himself! Initially it seems and easy mission, but certain events transpire that result in essentially a time travel hijack that alters the course of the past and therefore future.Still with me, just hold on.So Marty and Doc must go BACK to 1955 and re-fix things without impacting their own previous backwards time travel nor their dealings with Marty's future parents or young Biff – or alternate Doc for that matter.I'm sure that cleared it all up for you! BttF manages to link all that together yet still somehow both make sense and still be entertaining too. Fox again plays multiple relatives as well as multiple Marty's, and it is all held together without CGI by efficient use of camera tricks and false perspectives, a couple of the interactions between the Marty of the original film and the Marty in the sequel are just insanely smart.The film ends on yet another cliffhanger which sets up the threequel in the most blunt fashion that I can recall seeing in cinema, let's just say the film effectively ends with a teaser trailer for BttF 3 – and as I recall did so when released in the cinema 20 odd years ago.The one thing that sticks out in this film is the proliferation of product placement which was still in its infancy, hence some very clumsy and obvious 'ads' for Pepsi and Pizza Hut. They don't really detract from the film, they just stick out like the tasty pepperoni chunks on the new Extra-Cheez Family Feaster , that can only be washed down with the newest Pepsi experience, The Fizzmaster  sh*t now I'm doing it, I might take a Panadol  and lie down on my Sleepmaster 3000 .Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Took a complicated, creative and convoluted premise and was brave enough to make it so much more of all of those three adjectives. Excellent mainstream cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"Not the best, but the smartest","After sitting through the final Wild West one, it's easy to wish they'd never made a sequel at all. It was a straight western and fans of time travel movies don't need to see westerns. But the second part of the trilogy, often overlooked, often criticised was the cleverest of the three. Fact is, the first Back to the future was so ace that we WANTed another, we know we did. And the complexity of Part II, that attracted so much of the criticism, is what makes it special. It's really thoughtful - the writers straddle the line between predictions and plugs, making excellent jokes about the future. I loved this one when I saw it in the pictures and when it ended with To Be Continued, I could hardly breathe I was so excited. Shame about the last part, which isn't SO bad at all, just not what I wanted",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Achieves the same quality as the previous film,"The first episode was great so I was curious to see if the sequel would maintain at least the same quality and I'm very pleasantly surprised that it did. It's hard to say which part was better, because this one was perhaps even more exciting for me, but in the end I decided for the first one, which at times let me breathe and then sped up again and here, on the other hand, it didn't slow down and there was always something going on, which I believe will suit a lot of people, because there is always something going on. The constant adrenaline rush which was really cool, but I think the first one had a better ending, because here we are clearly told that we are going to have a threesome, while the first one ended and although the second one was good, I think it could have ended quite well. Here we are immediately excited for the threequel and so I didn't quite get a sense of an ending or any sort of climax, which was there but not like the previous film. Bottom line. Very hard to determine which episode was more successful. Both films were very good, but I choose the first one because of the already mentioned better ending. But otherwise I'm glad that the rule of only the first good part hasn't been proven here and that the sequel doesn't really fall short in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Past, Present, and Future - All in One!","Am I crazy to say I might actually like this more than the first one?! It's only by the ever-so-tiniest fraction though, because both movies are masterpieces as far as I'm concerned. The reason why I tend to lean slightly more towards this one, however, is because Marty and Doc travel to both the past, present, and future. I love that! I just love the uniqueness of each setting, and all the characters in the different years. The alternate 1985 is brilliantly done, so outrageous and eerily dark; and of course the future 2015 is very iconic. I'll never get bored of the 1st and 2nd BTTF movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Fun but not a classic like its predecessor,"With ""Back to the Future"" being such a huge hit in 1985 it was inevitable that a sequel would follow, particularly since the first movie's ending set the stage for it. Released four years later, part two of the planned trilogy contained some memorable moments but failed to match part one's high standard.The main cast from the first movie returned for this outing, with a couple of exceptions. The irreplaceable Crispin Glover (George McFly) was nevertheless replaced, appearing only in footage from the previous movie while another actor played his part in new scenes. Claudia Wells, who played Marty's girlfriend, decided to decline the sequel, which necessitated reshooting the ending scene from the first movie with her replacement (Elisabeth Shue). These losses were unfortunate but at least the bulk of the first movie's well-chosen cast was present.Plotwise, in this case we end up being transported to the future rather than the past. The scenes taking place 30 years into the future (in 2015) are the easily the film's most memorable. There are also scenes that take place in 1955 (during the events of the first film) and in an alternate version of 1985. As before, the main focus is on preventing history from being altered, though they don't seem to be too concerned about tampering with the future. In any case, I find that the story just isn't as compelling as the first movie's, which isn't helped by an ending that mainly just sets the audience up for the concluding chapter of the trilogy.On the technical side, as in the first movie, the direction by Robert Zemeckis is rock solid. The special effects for the 2015 sequences are a bit quaint by today's standards but they're still serviceable. Overall, the movie's production values show the benefit of the generous (but not extravagant) budget.Living up to the original ""Back to the Future"" was not an easy task. While this movie wasn't quite as successful or as enjoyable it still provided enough entertainment to be fondly remembered thirty years later, when its vision of 2015 provides an interesting glimpse into both the past and the future. I haven't seen the concluding film since its original release but my recollection is that it too is worthwhile but, ultimately, inessential.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Very clever sequel,"""Back to the Future, Part II"" manages to outdo it's predecessor in every way. Better acting, better effects, better storyline. It picks up directly where the original leaves off. This time, Marty, Doc Brown and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, travel to the year 2015 in order to prevent certain disasters with Marty's kids. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac (50 years of sports statistics 1950-2000) which he wants to take back to 1985 with the hopes of winning a lot of money. Unfortunately, old Biff Tannen manages to grab the book after Doc Brown throws it away, and steals the Delorean to take it to the future (or the past?) Marty, Doc and Jennifer arrive in 1985 again only to find it has been tampered with, and their little town of Hill Valley has become a bigtime war zone. Seems Biff was the cause of it, as he won a huge amount of money in his early years which caused him to become a millionaire tycoon. Marty investigates and him and Doc need to go back to 1955 in order to repair the damage done to 1985! (I hope you get it so far) In 1955, Marty tracks down young Biff this time in order to get the almanac and destroy it so the normal timeline can be restored. He also has to be careful not to run into his other ""self"", because he is in 1955 on the same day that he goes back to the future in the original movie. Well, this movie certainly is clever, no doubt about that, but it isn't at all lighthearted as the original, it is a dark movie, especially when the action shifts to the alternate 1985. For a movie that in reality, takes place 4 years after the first movie, it pulls off the continuity nicely. The acting is great, especially by Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox. Elizabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Jennifer and Crispin Glover is only in scenes from the original movie. This is definitely the best movie of the series, balancing action, humor and darkness equally.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Lacking the fresh originality from the first but still plenty of fun.,Back to the Future Part 2 (3.5 out of 5 stars).Back to the Future Part 2 is a pretty fair film. Continuing right after the first movie. Marty heads to the future to save his future son from making a mistake. But messing with time does not always go well. The plot is not as fresh as the first movie. It is still fun. The film first half seems similiar to the first. The future setting was cheesy and weird. The last half of the movie does pay back to the original which Marty is trying to correct time.The cast is good. The visuals are good for its time. The movie is pure fun and entertaining. The film does end in a cliffhanger for a third movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A worthy sequel,"Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies so it's no surprise that I took an immediate liking to Back to the Future Part II. It's not as humorous as the first, but it is much more creative and is still a fun time.As shown at the end of Back to the Future, Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) has just returned from 1955, saving his parents lives, along with his own. Everything seems great, until Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) pulls up on the front driveway of Marty's house in the DeLorean time machine. He tells Marty that they must go to 2015 to save Marty's future life! He leaves with his girlfriend Jennifer into the future. After repairing the damage done by Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Biff Tannnen's grandson, Marty buys a sports almanac that disrupts the space time continuem. While Marty and Doc are somewhere else, Biff steals the almanac and the DeLorean, goes to 1955 and gives the book to a young version of himself, and returns. When Doc and Marty reappear in 1985, they find that it has become a corrupt criminal empire with Biff as the head. Now they must return to 1955 and stop Biff from getting the almanac, if they can get their first!The movie doesn't really introduce any new cast members but their are some nice twists. Fox plays four different parts: Marty McFly, Marty McFly from 2015, Marty McFly Jr. and his future daughter! It looks like he was having a great time playing multiple roles, as the tradition carried on into the next sequel. Jennifer has a bigger part in Part II, but I preferred Claudia Wells to Elisabeth Shue.The creativity in this film sparkels. I love the sequences in 2015, showing all the future inventions like video waiters, Hover Boards, and a little pizza that, when microwaved, can turn into a large size in 4 seconds. Plus flying cars, holographic dog kennels, the list goes on and on. It's really fun to watch. Plus the visual effects are even better than those from the original film.The only problem I had with this movie is the humor. It's just not as funny as the first movie. Marty is not as funny and Crispin Glover is sorely missed as Marty's dad. Also, Biff Tannen is a high-school bully. It's a little over the top that he would turn into a vicious murderer that ""owns the police"" and turns Hill Valley into Hell. But nowadays, maybe it's a little more believable.All in all, this movie is really good. Anyone who saw the first should enjoy it a lot but I would reccomend seeing the first one and then the sequel if you have not seen either. A fun movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as you remember.....,"Quite a good film in some ways, but not really hitting the same heights as the original, some bits are a little repetitive and they weren't quite able to get the full cast back but overall it's still a memorable one to watch, their imaginative tongue in cheek take on the future provided plenty of moments for madness. The hoverboard and the self tying Nikes were all fun ideas.You have to agree it lacks the wonder and the magic of the original. In this one everything feels very off and rush, right from the first 3 minutes you're thrown into the story struggling to get a grasp of what's going on or why it matters. The first film was so much better, you spent about 20 minutes with the main character, finding out about his life, his dreams, his frustrations, every step along the way it was fun and interesting too. Then all these dreams and frustrations really pay off at the end of the movie. Here though what is going on firstly? Why should we care? Marty won't be trapped in the past or be erased from history, it's all so much less low stakes in the first act. Some of the ideas about the future were very spot on, video conferencing, smart homes, drones, but then you have the awful fashion and flying cars. The film trades heavily on nostalgia for the original film but this often involves just repeating the same sequences and dialogue again, just in a different setting, how about a chase? How about the bully barging into the café and so on? There's also not much Doc in this film either, and the sweet relationship from the first film just doesn't get developed here. The plot gets a lot more convoluted this time round, the constant switching between time zones, things just never get a chance to settle. Even the ending is not really an ending and it even manages to retcon the original much better film. Several of the cast are also clearly far too old to be playing teenagers at this point. All in all this has nothing on the original. 3/5 at best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"Not as good as the first, but not bad either.","When I was younger I always thought, that the part two of the Back To The Future series was funniest film of the bunch. But now I've come to reconsider this, and become in a conclusion, that the first one is a lot funnier than the sequel.Don't get me wrong, BTTF2 is fun and well made flick, and it does carry on the candle very well, so there's nothing wrong about it. It's just it hasn't taken the time as well as the first film.Biggest draw back are the special effects, the flying cars, which are far too clearly just that: special effects. My biggest nit pick about them is, that in some places there are notable light differences on them and they stick out too well from the film, but they are luckily mostly well done.The script isn't as good as it was in the first film, but the time continuity issues are as fun as ever. You really could tie your brains into a knot, if you would think about them seriously for a while.The film starts right from where the first one ended: Marty (Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) go in the future to stop their kids to be from goofing around. But it's not just that, there is something else in the past that must be stopped from happening.As I said, my biggest nit pick is about the effects, but other than that there isn't nothing wrong about the film.

But I think that this was somewhat of a plus point because when you are bored you can sort out things in your head. And the concept did need some sorting out.I guess that's all.

"There's still fun to be had here, but they may have tried to cram too much in here","After visiting 2015, Marty McFly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip.The above is IMDB's own plot summary for Back to the future part 2 which kind of gives you an idea of what you're getting into with this sequel. The original film had time-travel interwoven into its story, but when watching the original film it always felt, at its core, that being fun was at the forefront of the picture.Don't get me wrong BTTF part 2 is still fun, but it feels much more overloaded than the first film (the time-travel aspect is much more complex and takes a bit of time to get your head around) and it felt to me that a more expansive story has taken some of the fun away from proceedings. Like I say, this isn't a big issue and BTTF part 2 is still a laugh, but I don't think it has the rewatchability value that the first film has.Still one thing that doesn't disappoint here are the main cast who are arguably better in this film than the first; both Michael J Fox and Thomas Wilson take on more than 1 role and both actors are on top form here - although Thomas Wilson's contribution is once again far more memorable. These scenes are fun, but unfortunately they only exist as narrative devices to move the story along and come thick and fast and some of these brief scenes are the best parts of the film. Like I say the central concept is fine and the film is still good fun, but it never quite manages to match the quality of the first film which managed to have slightly more fun with a story that was also slightly more endearing.Whilst BFF2 deserves some credit for offering a deeper and more expansive plot sometimes they say that less is more...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"Heavy on the Sci-fi, and I love it!","Bob Gale, Neil Canton, and Robert Zemeckis did not intend to make a sequel to Back to the Future. The first film ended with Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying in the Delorean, intent on traveling to the year 2015. This was only meant to be a joke, so when Universal asked them to do a second movie, the writers were sort of in a bind. Robert Zemeckis was not interested in doing a movie about the future, and the writers had no idea what to do with Jennifer during all the action. Despite a possible lack of enthusiasm from Zemeckis and difficulties with the writing, Back to the Future II turned out to be a very fun, but somewhat darker sequel.In the year 2015, Marty and Doc prevent Marty McFly Jr. from agreeing to assist Griff Tannen (Biff's grandson) rob a store or a bank. During all the madness Marty buys a Sports Almanac, which contains a record of the outcome of every sporting event from 1950 to 2000. It should be the size of a telephone book but it's just the size of a graphic novel. An old Biff secretly steals the time machine and the almanac, gives it to himself in the year 1955, and seriously alters history. Doc and Marty return to a 1985 that has turned into a ghetto. Biff became a millionaire, murdered George McFly, and married Marty's mother. In order to set the time line straight, Marty and Doc have to return to the night of the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance from the first movie and destroy the Sports Almanac.The crew went crazy with the design of the future. Holograms, flying cars, and floating skate boards all make up the look of the year 2015. This was my favorite part of the movie when I was a kid because it was the most outlandish. Of course they got everything about the future wrong, but who really cares? Now I find myself liking the science-fiction aspect of the story. Returning to the first movie and seeing two Martys and two Docs on screen at once was a brilliant idea. I think the second act of the movie was so dark that it was seen as a departure from what made the first movie so good. The movie does lack the heartwarming feel of the first film, but they brought it back with full force in Part III. If I had one major criticism it would be that it takes too long to really get going. The first half of the film is just exposition for the third act in 1955, and the ending is just a set up for Part III, which makes it less satisfying than the first movie for many people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite Film Of All Time...,"My favorite film ever. This is a movie where I feel like everything is great, and right, and there isn't a bad thing in this movie for me. I love every character here, and I feel like every character evolved and got better. Marty is a very fun protagonist, and it's interesting to watch his trials throughout this film. He had a wide range of emotions in this film, and it's amazing. Doc has a bit more character, as it's clear he cares about Marty a lot, as well as being a character who knows that he has to do what is right to save the universe. Biff is such a good villian, being such an over-the-top incarnation of a bully, even going so far to endanger the universe. Lorraine is so interesting to see different versions of, and all of the side characters are delightful. This plot is one of my favorites of all time, with it's twisty time-travel being so interesting. This is a nostalgiac trip for me, as I can always remember how much my mind was blown the first time I watched it. I've always loved alternative universes and timeline, and it's explored so well. I've always loved how dark this film is, at least compared to the other two. I've always loved how this film goes back to the first film, probably the only movie ever that does... And of course, all of the technical parts are great - the cinematography, music, effects... It's one of the best sequels ever, and is, and probably will always be, my favorite movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not ok,"The first part of this movie is way too good. And Hollywood is good known for creating stupidest sequels. The first part is about the protagonist travels to past, gets stuck and tries to get back into present time. When it comes to the second part the story completely changes, the protagonist and the doctor (who found the time travel) travels to the future to save his child from a terrible situation. They didn't even try with the screenplay properly. Was way too boring.

"Not as good as the first, still a pretty good movie","Somehow, I've never watched Back to the Future II before. I don't know how this happened, but recently I watched the film for the first time. I honestly found it disappointing when compared to the first one. This is still a pretty good movie, but I didn't find it anywhere near as good as the original. First off, this one isn't nearly as funny. The handful of jokes that were thrown in there kind of fell flat for me. I also found it to be not as entertaining for the first two acts. The plot isn't as engaging as the first one for me, I felt that it didn't have the same charm as the first one. Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox still give great performances and their dynamic is still the best part of the movie for me. I don't think the plot starts to pick up until the third act where Marty and Doc go back to the events of the original movie.

"So confusing, it's ridiculous","""Back to the Future"" was a wonderful movie. I wouldn't mind taking my kids to it if it weren't for the mild language and the little bits of sexual innuendo.However, I have to say that ""Back to the Future II"" /doesn't/ work for me. OK, it's entertaining, to a certain extent. But what killed it for me was its logistical errors. Sure, Dr. Brown (played wonderfully by Christopher Lloyd) and Marty (the star of the movie, Michael J. Fox) go ahead into time to ""the amazing year"" 2015. And they stop Marty, Jr., Marty's son, from being a part of a crime that was the idea of Griff, Biff's grandson (both played by Thomas J. Wilson). By the way, I would have thought that Biff wouldn't have any grandchildren, let along children in this being that George, Marty's dad, stood up to him. The rest, I'm not even going to go there.But, then, Biff gets wind of the whole situation with the time machine, not to mention that Marty wants to profit from it by buying a sports almanac for the years 1950-2000. He steals the DeLorean behind Doc and Marty's backs to give the book to young Biff. And it's obvious to me that not only would George McFly get killed by Biff and that Doc Brown would be committed to a mental institution, but also that old Biff would probably get stuck in 1955 because the DeLorean would have disappeared something like everything else that changed with Marty's meddling.But, I don't know. I guess Zemekis (sp) needed a sequel to ""Back to the Future.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"It can't beat the original, but it is one of the best sequels ever","In 1985 a film called Back to the Future came to theaters. It was a fantastic movie that combined many different genres together to make one fantastic piece of 80's cinema. The sequel doesn't completely match the charm of the original, but it's still a very charming film. A lot of the charm that the original had more of is made up for by the fact that the movie goes back to the events of the first film. This makes us see the film we watched in 1985 in different points of view. The future world they create is also very interesting, and had very strong visuals for the time. One of my favorite scenes is when Marty goes into Cafe 80's, and elements of the 80's like Nintendo, Micheal Jackson, and Ronald Regan are everywhere. Back to the Future 2 isn't as good as the original, but is an excellent example of how to make a sequel.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
2015 is 8 years ago now. Ooh La La! Ooh La La!,"Previously on Back to the Future. I just want to point out something about it. I don't understand anything about time travel when I watched the first film. I just found time traveling confusing. But watching it again I understand what it is, when you travel back in time in the old years and of course, recent years. Robert Zemeckis is back to direct the second movie, Back to the Future Part II along with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returning to their roles. Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future; when their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson again, steals Doc's DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline. OK, so after the first film got it's massive praises back in 1985 the movie itself takes place in the year 1985 and now in 1955 where Marty had accidentally traveled in the year 1955. This one does the same thing and this time something is seriously wrong. Okay, now let me get to something that what changed about the movie. You know Claudia Wells, right? Where she played Jennifer Parker from the first film, she was replaced by Elisabeth Shue because she retired from acting due to her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, so now they reshot that scene in the opening where the first one ended. And of course, Crispin Glover didn't get to return which he want to due to he got paid less money. He sued the producers for using his likeness without his permission. Now there's something I didn't know about one thing that I completely missed out is the fact that I see Michael J. Fox in drag. It always baffles me that I didn't know who dresses up like a woman. I do know however that Tim Curry is always like that from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I gotta say I really love the sequel much like the first one. I know it's not as good as the first but once you've seen it you grown to appreciate it. It had a funny story that correct the mistakes what Biff has done and it reenacts the same scenes from the first movie without bumping into the other selves. I also liked the funny part where Marty sneaks into Mr Strickland's office to get the almanac but finds the cover of it with the ""Ooh La La"" catalog. Now that I'm going to do the third and final film of the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future Part III. Stay Tuned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A clever and entertaining sequel....,"Although Back to the Future Part II cannot match the sheer joy or charm of the original movie it is still very much a worthy sequel.Much darker than the first movie, Marty McFly finds himself zipping from the future back to the 1950's of the original film trying to correct a few messes in the time space continuim along the way. This movie is blessed with many of the original cast (although Crispin Glover is a no show) and some very clever moments. The special effects are very impressive and the movie's bright and funky take on the future is a refreshing change from most sci-fi flicks depressing and cold visions. Once again Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox light up the screens with top class performances and prove one of cinema's best double acts.The most enjoyable moments of the movie are the parts when Marty and Doc get to see themselves as they were in the first film, talk about deja vu....and Marty watching himself perform Johnny Be Goode onstage at the school dance is a delight. This sequel manages to keep the story zapping along at a fast and exciting pace and the inclusion of Marty Jnr and Marlene McFly (both played by Fox) add some funny moments as does the holographic shark and the corny Cafe 80's of the future. On the down side I could have done without Elizabeth Shue's overacting and constant gurning ruining every scene she's in but on the whole i thoroughly enjoyed this clever film and  I would highly recommend it.

Not as good as original,"This sequel to the 1985 hit was a bit of a miss for me.

Good use of CGI, and the actors playing against themselves look flawless. Middle age Biff could pass of as Trump, followed by a vastly superior sequel in 1990.

Time Traveling can be a Real Headache,"Many critics of this sequel probably find this effort unnecessary and others may just find it overly confusing. The streamlined, comparatively simple plot of the first ""Back to the Future""(85) gives way here to a messy 'to and fro' time travel angle in which the heroes just can't seem to get it right. With the audience needing to concentrate all their energy on keeping track of the plot twists, much of the entertainment value could be lost. There's validity to this argument; however, I, for one, admire dense plotting, especially in science fiction tales - the more complex, the better, I say. It shows me someone was making the effort and wanted the viewer to wrap his mind around concepts not usually encountered.In this follow-up, Marty (Fox) goes to his future (year 2015 or 30 years in his future) to help his own son. As usual, the filmmakers overestimated progress, since we now know the flying cars in this future will not come about 10 years from now. The motivations seem haphazard; in the 1st pic, Marty went back in time by accident; here, he and the Doc purposely travel in time and manage to make a mess of things. Their arch-nemesis, Biff (Wilson), steals a future book back to 1955 and changes the course of history. The revised 'present' of 1985 becomes a nightmarish surreal world of anarchy and decay. With us so far? Now the heroes again go back to 1955 to correct things. Here's where things get really messy: Marty & the Doc are running around in 1955 while their counterparts from the 1st Back to the Future are also there in the background doing their thing. So now we're seeing the same scenes of the previous film from a slightly new perspective (from the p.o.v.of this movie's Marty & Doc).Wow. The filmmakers either wanted to dazzle the audience or drive them insane with this mind-warping running about. The drawback to the final 3rd of the movie is that most viewers will expend all their energy trying to remember scenes of the first film. But you really have to admire the creative attempt of metaphysically snaking back to the events of the previous film, seeing it from the inside out. Even if the whole Back to the Future trilogy becomes needlessly complex thanks to this chapter.

Andrew Clark, Allison Reynolds, Brian Johnson, Claire Standish, and John Bender are also eligible candidates. That's how I portray it.

Spielberg does it again,"BTTF is one of the movie series you just have to revisit every now and then.

They handle time-warping easily, although it can be a challenge for the viewer: where the heck are they NOW??? But pay attention.

"Downhill from the original, but still a worthy sequel","I'm sure that anyone who saw ""Back to the Future"" back when it was first out could tell that there would likely be a sequel. It took four years, but finally, in 1989, ""Back to the Future Part II"" was released. As with many movie sequels, this one has not been as well received as its predecessor, and many have considered it a disappointment, but much more disappointing sequels have seen the light of day.Doc takes Marty and Jennifer in his time machine to the year 2015 so they can fix up some problems with the future of the McFly family. While in that year, Marty purchases an almanac telling the results of sports events from 1950 to 2000. After they are finished their work in 2015, they return to 1985, but soon, it is clear that it's a lot different from the way it was when they left! It turns out that while they were in 2015, an elderly Biff Tannen borrowed their time machine and travelled back to 1955, where he gave the almanac to his teenage self! By 1985, after easily winning so many bets in the past thirty years, Biff has become very rich and powerful, and has turned Hill Valley into a nightmare! It is now up to Marty and Doc to travel back to 1955 and somehow retrieve the sports almanac!The IMDb rating for ""Back to the Future Part II"" is 7.2/10, which is significantly lower than the 8.2/10 rating for the original ""Back to the Future"", but is still a fairly high rating, which means that many have still enjoyed this second installment in the trilogy, including me. I have to agree that this sequel is inferior to the original. It's a bit darker, with more unpleasant things happening, which may not always be a bad thing, but here, it might be overdone just a bit. There are also probably not quite as many laughs in this sequel as there are in its predecessor. However, just like the original ""Back to the Future"", this second installment in the trilogy is mostly very exciting, which is enough to save it.If you don't like the original ""Back to the Future"", then I think it's obvious that there's no point in watching this 1989 sequel. However, if you're a big fan of the original, but haven't seen ""Part II"", I'm sure you really want to know where the story goes from there. So, while I wouldn't expect to be as pleased with this movie as you were with its extremely popular predecessor (unless you're really lucky), I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this second installment in the trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"I agree with Doc Brown, ""GREAT SCOTT!""","This ""BTTF"" series really makes sense. The DeLorean/time machine got a big upgrade when Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) comes back to 1985 from the future. The fuel was different. Because of the upgrade, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox, Alex Keaton on ""Family Ties"") was concerned about having road space. When goes to the future, he gets the picture. Unlike the first one, the really cool part of the movie is when he used those hover-boards. The real foe in this movie is Biff(Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's father's nemesis. Going to the future was fine, so when he went back to 1985, something was wrong. The Hill Valley he knows wasn't the way it was. His house was occupied by another family, and his neighborhood is a crime-zone. The time has been altered, by Biff. the source of the change, The Sports Almanac. The solution, go back to 1955. It was funny when young Biff crashed his car into a manure truck. Thanks to the hover-board, the future of the McFly legacy is safe. This movie got a lot of characters, and Michael J. Fox really outdid himself there. GREAT SCOTT!! 3 OUT OF 5 STARS!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

2015 will look like 80's compared to what is shown in this movie!!!!!!!,"Things have barely settled from the excitement and resolve of the original Back to the Future, when in pops that crazy inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) with news that in order to prevent a series of events that could ruin the McFly name for posterity, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox ) and his girlfriend are whisked into the future to the year 2015, where Marty must tangle with a teen rogue named Griff, who's obviously the descendant of Biff, the first Future film's bully. Marty foils Griff and his group when he jumps on an air-foil skateboard that flies him through town at rakish speeds with the loser bullies beaten again. Marty gets a money- making brainstorm before hopping in the time-traveling DeLorean, and he purchases a sports almanac. He figures that back in 1985 he'll be able to place sure- fire bets using the published sports scores of the games that are yet to happen. Unfortunately for Marty, Dr. Brown disapproves of his betting scheme -- he feels too much messing with time is very dangerous -- and he tosses the almanac. A hidden Biff overhears the discussion about the almanac, sees it get tossed out, and grabs it. Thus begins a time-traveling swirl to make the head spin. Biff swipes the DeLorean, heads back to 1955, and with the help of the unerring almanac, bets his way to power. The now-altered ""Biff world"" has turned into a nightmarish scene with Biff the mogul, residing in a Vegas-styled pleasure palace and running everything. It's all our hero Marty can do to pull the pieces together this time, as he must jump between three generations of intertwined time travel.

As amazing as the first one,You can tell when they made these movies they really made them back to back if not all at once then just chopped them up in the editing room.I really don't like the use of time travel as a writing tool as it can be used by lazy writers to get them out of hot water. Can't explain this thing... time travel did it.But this movie does it so well and even though it treads over scenes that we are already familiar with from the first one it is still really charming and fun to watch.

Filled with silly jokes and comical, and dramatic irony, with the same characters as the first, with a few twists, but are still all the more lovable.Marty, Doc, and Jenny, Martie's girlfriend, travel to the year 2015 to resolve a conflict involving Martie's son.

Some of the events were quite unnecessary, and the scenes back in 1955 kind of borrow from the first a little. But it still stays strong with the irony, with clever jokes and humor.The doc remains his ordinarily crazy self, along with many other characters.

McFly!,"Sometimes sequels don't always work out. In the case of Back to the Future 2, it works in some levels, but the recycled ideas of the original is an obvious case of either fan service, or The Bobs didn't know exactly where to go with this one. I can tell you one thing, though, that as a kid I was anxiously awaiting this film, and I remember being so excited at the theater with my dad. I remember rushing home excitedly to tell my mom about how great it was. Oh, the simple minds of youth.The film takes place exactly where the first one left off, but reenacted so it doesn't quite play exactly like the end of the first film but it worked enough. The destination is immediately in the year 2015, with Marty, Doc and Jennifer flying in the Delorean in a traffic of speeding, flying cars. Jennifer starts to ask questions and Doc immediately knocks her out with some spray. In all actuality, this is a way to get Jennifer out of the film for time being as The Bobs couldn't come up with a good storyline for her. However, I give them credit, because what happens later was a very good scene.Basically Marty has to take the role of one of kids' in the future to not participate in Griff's gang (Griff is the son of Biff, but who he conceived him with is never explained). I guess Marty Jr. winds up in jail, his sister bails him out and they both spend like twenty years in the slammer. Now how this effects Marty, I don't know. Wouldn't it be easier for Doc to say, I don't know, look Marty up like Marty asked him to and warn him about his son's participation? Wouldn't that be easier than to nab Marty in the present just to wind up being chased by Griff and his gang?Remember how I said it used recycled ideas from the first one? Yeah, that's the hoverboard sequence. I mean, almost scene by scene is nearly an exact replica of the first film. I like the fact that the hoverboards can't go over water, but wouldn't that make Marty sink into the pool? Anyway, the bullies fly in the air and through the building and somehow this gets them arrested. I don't see how. People get arrested for accidents in 2015? While I'm at it, when did Marty get so upset from being called chicken? I know it's a plot device but that really came out of nowhere. Oh well.My biggest problem with 2015 is even though I like the ideas that was put into it, I certainly didn't like the how it was written. Besides the obvious strange plot devices, it just seemed to me that the performances felt forced, as if they were trying harder to be funny. I'm not going to lie, though, that one of the better scenes in the film was when Jennifer was sneaking through her future home. My favorite scene here is when Marty's Asian boss yells out, ""MCFLY!"" Definitely the best scene in the movie, and perhaps my favorite of the whole series. Too funny.The filmmakers must acknowledged that the whole ""something's gotta be done about your kids"" plot was a little too out there, so it focused on older Biff giving a sports almanac to younger Biff. This is what altered 1985, because somehow older Biff knew how to operate a time machine and go back to any year he wanted as if everyone knew how to operate a time machine. Anyway, the alternate 1985 was a little too over the top, but I really did enjoy the scenes in Biff's home and how he tries to murder Marty. It separated itself from the rest of the series and really showed the filmmakers were going for something different.The 1955 stuff, well.... it's basically a total rehash of the first Back to the Future. I did enjoy these scenes, especially watching Marty trying to get back the almanac from Biff which created a pretty tense scene between Biff in his car and Marty on his hoverboard. However, Doc's car being struck by lightning without going 88 miles per hour was something of an orthodox. If that was the case, then in the first film why didn't Marty just wait at the street light where the lightning struck rather then going 88 miles per hour if the lightning could send him home anyway? I know The Bobs explained, but it's still a plot hole.Back to the Future 2 is still a worthy sequel but it doesn't pack the same punch of the first film. I can watch the first film over and over again, as it has the right pace and the story was told wonderfully. I wish the same could be said about the sequel, but it's better than most sequels out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
As American as betting on College Football,"I have always wanted to know how does old Biff immediately how to operate a time machine?? Picking up at the exact same moment the 1st movie ends, Marty has to go the future to save his son from making a bed decision. Just like part 1, there is not much I need to say to sell this movie. It is fun, clever, and everything a summer blockbuster needs to be to succeed. There was a little more discussion about the effects of time travel in part 2, and we got to witness the flawed character of Marty McFly, as he stops whatever he is doing, no matter how important, and puts up his dukes at the mere threat of being a chicken. Sophomoric, but it fits perfectly into this world created by Spielberg, Zemeckis, and Gale, and for me was a constant reminder that this was a family film that was meant just to entertain. Highlights include a hover board in both the future and the past(which, by the way we are re only 5 years away from that needing to be a reality), the phrase 'Great Scott', which I am pretty sure Christopher Lloyd negotiated a bonus into his contract every time he squeezed one in, and the introduction of everyone in Americas new dream (to go into the future and find a sports almanac that can be used to bet with and make millions!).

Hits The Ground Running,"BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II hits the ground running like few films as our heroes thrust themselves into 2015. It's a visual treat as teen time traveler Marty McFly (a distinctly non-teen Michael J. Fox) defies gravity on his hoverboard, encounters futuristic marvels and, in a memorable few moments, visits a retro '80s cafe. The fun spirit of the original lives on. The film takes a darker turn, however, with Marty forced to alter history to prevent the rise of family nemesis Biff Tannen. Suddenly Marty's dodging bullets and leaping from buildings instead of jamming on the guitar (though he finds time to do that, too).This film is quite different from the others in the popular trilogy, but it is also, a number of ways, superior to what came before and (particularly) what came after. It benefits immensely from a wildly imaginative script. Rather than rehashing the original, as so many sequels do, director Robert Zemeckis ingeniously intertwined the two films by having the characters literally revisit the events of the first entry. BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II is complex, to be sure, but not so complex so as to detract from the viewer's enjoyment. It is a thinking person's time travel adventure, one with enough to satisfy multiple viewings.Most other areas of the film hold up well. The Oscar-nominated special effects, as touched on earlier, remain superb nearly two decades later. And because it was made before the rise of CGI, the effects and stunts have a homegrown appeal that is increasingly difficult to find today. Fox is strong in the lead, but Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown again nearly steals the show. And Zemeckis' immense directorial talents are on full display as he knows just when to pick up the action and when to give us a chance to absorb all we've just seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
More Special Effects Make for a More Entertaining Sequel,"I actually liked this follow up to Robert Zemeckis's 1985 hit better than the original.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are back as time-traveling Marty McFly and his mad-scientist companion, but this time they bounce back and forth between past and present in a convoluted plot. Admittedly, the plot is more complicated than it needs to be, but because so much time is spent years into the future, the film provides more opportunities for nifty special effects.The series would continue with one more sequel set in the wild west, which I have not seen.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A little dated for today's audience,"Sequels seldom live up to the original and this movie is no exception. While certainly somewhat entertaining fare, the characters are unrealisticly inane which makes it difficult to really get involved with the plot.  Robert Zemekis admitted that they originally did not intend to make a sequel to the first one but the success of the first prompted this one.  Unfortunately, they decided to choose to make the movie too campy, thereby diminishing the drama that we had in the first one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
1985 technology in Docs 1955 Lab???.......Dangerous,"Towards the end of part 1 we see Marty in the cafe writing a heartfelt letter to the doc telling him to take precautions and NOT TO OPEN UNTIL 1985! ... So OK, marty makes it back to his own reality of 1985 and he has ten minutes to save the doc before the Libyans get to him.This is my question, Now when marty is interacting with the 1955 doc and they are working on a plan to get him home to 1985 the 1955 Doc has got the 1985 delorean in his lab!! this means the doc invents the time machine earlier then because he has ALREADY seen the finished article. Surely he would have been tempted to study the flux capacitor in more detail, asses the technology of the time circuits and Mr Fusion and even look closer at the nuclear chamber where the engine requires the 1.21GW! this means he has the basic blue prints of his 1985 timemachine sitting in his 1955 lab as the working prototype and he could have had a time machine up and running by as early as the mid to late sixties...The whole of BTTF part one is then a paradox right!? lol",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
I missed the innocence and the simplicity of the first part,"""Nobody calls me chicken""Unlike the first part's much simpler approach, this continuation here seems to be a bit more considerate about the scientific validation.

It's not that, I am against any profound treatment nor am I in any way suggesting this was a horrendous idea; it's just that, I longed for the innocence, the simplistic appeal of its predecessor.

How can the weakest film in the series be SO DAMN PERFECT?!,"As the title suggests, Back to the Future Part II is the second installment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up immediately where the original Back to the Future left off - Marty, Doc and Jennifer going into the future (2015 - our past LOL) to ""fix"" Marty and Jennifer's kids futures. However, the old Bill Tannen quietly nabs the DeLorean and drastically alters the past, making the present dystopian. Doc and Marty (Jennifer is passed out) must try to work out where Biff altered the timeline, and prevent the altering.This film is the darkest of the trilogy, and the weakest. But it's the most original of the BTTF sequels, and everything in it - even the scenes I used to dislike - fits and works perfectly. It's the most complex movie in the series. A perfectly done movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"While it does retread the first film in some ways, Part II is still a very good sequel","Back at 1985, Robert Zemeckis brought us Back to the Future, a story about Marty McFly who travels back to 1955 in a Delorean his nuclear physicist friend Dr. Emmet Brown made. In order to get back to 85, he has to seek the help of Doc Brown's 1955 counterpart and help his father fall in love with his mother. It became a worldwide box office phenomenon both critically and financially. Later, in 1989, Zemeckis and the other crew planned to make a film trilogy starting with Part 2.Taking place in the cliffhanger from the first movie, Marty McFly, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's future son from sabotaging his family's future. Meanwhile, their arch nemesis Biff Tannen (his future self) steals the time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, creating an alternate version of 1985. So, it's up to Marty and Doc Brown to travel back to 1955 and restore the timeline.Now that it's been thirty years, Part II is an example of a sequel that is very good. Before I give this a lot of praise, yes, it does retread the first film in some ways (which is the only reason why some people don't like this sequel very much), but that's my only nitpick. Everything else is done very well. The story expands on the first movie going into full detail on the whole concept of alternate timelines. It also gives a character backstory to Biff Tannen on why he's been a bully to George McFly back at 1955 due to his wealth. Not to mention it left another cliffhanger (which I'll get to in my review of Part III).That being said, the production design is fantastic from the futuristic 2015 setting to the alternate 1985 setting. The directing and editing is superb and the pacing is very good. Alan Silvestri reprises the themes from the first film in spectacular fashion while introducing some new themes. And the acting from everyone is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to shine in their chemistry as Marty McFly and Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson gives some complexity to his role as Biff Tannen. Other actors including Elisabeth Shue and Jeffrey Weissman (who replaced Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover as both Jennifer and George McFly) and returning actors including Lea Thompson and James Tolkan as Lorraine McFly and Mr. Strickland do a good job too.Overall, Part II may not be on par with the original, but it's a good sequel in it's own right. Go check it out to those who haven't seen it yet. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"The ""difficult"" second film","Sixteen years on and I can remember it like yesterday...which is handy because the real yesterday was 'king dreadful. I was swaggering down Causeway Head, Penzance's premier street as its the only one that contains a cinema AND a chip shop - in my hand a thick wedge of pornographic magazines. My Destination? 'The Matrix', an incomplete garage where myself and two friends stored a hoard bought using homeless men given extra for cigarettes. As I walked past the Savoy I saw a coming soon poster for the Back to the Future sequel. I had no idea it was even being made. It was a fantastic moment. The original was one of my all time favourite things and the only one I could enjoy with my Mother in the room. When I finally saw it 3 or 4 months later I was entertained but held reservations which hold up to this day and that, lucky people that you are, I'll share with you now. Immediately it was apparent that there were some problems. One, Claudia Wells had become Elizabeth Shue and no-one had noticed - worrying because it was the original actresses good looks that had effectively saved Marty's bacon when his assertion that ""she's beautiful"" had caused him to whip out the clock-tower flyer with its precious future information. Two, Chrispin Glover had chosen not to participate. Why was this allowed to happen? He was a key supporting character in the first film and though they could clearly get round it with a lot of soft long distance shots and layers of makeup his absence left a hole in the ensuing two episodes. I'd love to see the original paradox script which presumably had him in it. Three, it was too complicated and so packed with plot that you never really had the opportunity to sit back and breathe it in like the first film. You know it's been retrospectively plotted when you have to insert a scene into the original epilogue to make it work. Four, continuity. Michael J Fox's appearance in the 1985 film is a matter of record as its, er, on film, so you'd think it wouldn't be a stretch for just one person to observe that the diminutive man child had different hair. For those of you that think this is pedantry, YES IT IS and wacha going'do about it? Some nights all I can think about is a digitally tinkering but thats a different subject entirely and not something we should go into here. So part II is good fun, cleverly conceived and all the rest of it but it just doesn't have the heart of the first and of course it doesn't really work as a self-contained instalment because its essentially half a film - a 108 minute setup for the better, more satisfying part III. 'Tis a comedy lets not forget so its worth mentioning some good jokes - Nixton's fifth term in the alternate future, the black and decker hydrated pizza, Doc Brown's ""Women!"" monologue and of course ""Ooh la la!"" OK, the product placement is disgraceful but you can use the 'minority report' defence (which presumably the producers saw coming) and argue that it adds a real-worldly dimension to the future. That said, Pepsi did very well out of the futures and that would be fine 'cept it tastes terrible. Its nice that you have a sequel that does something different from its predecessor and credits the audience with a bit of intelligence, plus it was blatantly robbed of the best-visual Oscar (went to the Abyss would you believe). Excellent though flawed entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Just As Good As The 1st!,"Started off with little traction, but the rest had me at the end of my seat. The Almanac was a thrilling idea for a sequel!

For the most part, the important characters are all back. Michael J. Fox obviously enjoyed doing these films (he made 3 of them!) and he is the best actor in the series, this one included.

The interesting question of 'what if'.,"While the sequel to the classic Back to the Future doesn't offer much new in the character department, we do get an entertaining movie filled with funny guesses at how the world would look in the future and what Marty McFly's life would be if the timeline was altered.This is that kind of movie that can't exist without its predecessor, because of how their timelines cross and affect each other.But it all flows very well without relying too much on the events of the first movie. The meeting of the timelines has a purpose and doesn't feel forced. And the movie has some strong scenes you can't help but feel all the more with these likable heroes and fierce bad guys.And while that form of time travel in theory could make up an endless amount of sequls, I'm glad to see that the Back to the Future trilogy only is a trilogy, but also that each sequel serves a purpose and is connected to each other.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The best of the 3,Here it is. Of the 3 films this is my favourite one. It is a bit confusing but is inspired.

Go Back to the Future again,"Marty McFly has just returned from 1955 when Doc Brown takes him to 2015 in order to stop his son from going to jail. While in 2015 an older Biff finds out about the time machine and uses it to give his younger self a sports almanac with all major sporting results till the year 2000. Using the Sports almanac Biff becomes one of the richest men alive and changes history dramatically. It's up the Marty and the doc to go back in time in order to stop Biff from ever using it.Back to the Future, Part 2. The second part of the popular trilogy might well be one of the best sequels ever made. Making a sequel is a difficult process and using a time machine the makers could have gone to every time-period they wanted but because of the ending of back to the future they didn't have that freedom. Thank god for that because they probably would have gone to a time-period they found cool rather than a time-period which would work well for the movie.The unique thing about the back to the future trilogy is that they all take place in the same town with the same characters. One of the biggest mistakes you can make in a sequel is introducing new characters for no good reason. In this film the new characters are either older versions of characters (Biff) from the first movie or their children (Martin Mcfly Jr.) and grandchildren (Griff). We already know these characters which makes it a lot easier to just follow the story instead of having to figure out who they are and why they are there.Despite some plot holes or rather mistakes about time-travel (which aren't really that distracting, in fact you won't really notice them unless you start thinking about it.)

SCIENCE- FICTION/ ADVENTURE/ COMEDYCo-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis directing an unnecessary sequel which is the result of the studio demanding for a second one, which the plot device is similar to part one divided into two films with the only difference is the gimmick in terms of the futuristic environment that the tone, some of the situations is identical as the first film.

Better than the first,B2tF is an adventurous time adventure. It's jam packed with so much misadventure.I really think the MCU and the Russos should have taken note of this because Endgame was a weak time travel movie. These 1980s movies make Endgame look bad. It made billions for being subpar.I don't want to wait another 10 years to see the consequence in another subpar movie.B2tF was so much fun. It's about the going to the future to correct the past to correct the future.It's a movie where Kevin Feige wishes he had a time machine so he can undo the subparness called Endgame.It excels better than the first.

"There's still fun to be had here, but they may have tried to cram a bit too much in this one","After visiting 2015, Marty McFly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip.The above is IMDB's own plot summary for Back to the future part 2 which kind of gives you an idea of what you're getting into with this sequel. The original film had time-travel interwoven into its story, but when watching the original film it always felt, at its core, that being fun was at the forefront of the picture.Don't get me wrong BTTF part 2 is still fun, but it feels much more overloaded than the first film (the time-travel aspect is much more complex and takes a bit of time to get your head around) and it felt to me that a more expansive story has taken some of the fun away from proceedings. Like I say, this isn't a big issue and BTTF part 2 is still a laugh, but I don't think it has the rewatchability value that the first film has.Still one thing that doesn't disappoint here are the main cast who are arguably better in this film than the first; both Michael J Fox and Thomas Wilson take on multiple roles (from different time periods) and both actors are on top form here - it's funny seeing Thomas Wilson having a barney with his grandad in one scene and then later arguing with his younger self when he goes back to the past. These scenes are fun, but unfortunately they only exist as narrative devices to move the story along and come thick and fast and some of these brief scenes are the best parts of the film.The main focus of the film sees Marty trying to retrieve a magazine that he bought in 2015 which he's trying to get his hands on back in 1955 to try to stop Biff from becoming a millionaire. Whilst it's an amusing enough idea, it isn't quite as endearing as Marty's quest in the first film.As I've said though there's still fun to be had here, but there isn't quite as much on offer as there was in the first film and whilst there's a deeper more expansive plot in this sequel sometimes they say that less is more...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A darker film,"The second installment sees Marty and Doc going forward in time. They then return to the 80's only to find that they are in 	  an alternate 1985 so they must go back to 1955 again to fix things. One thing that doesn't quite work is Biff's trip back in time. If he did change things back in 1955 when he went back to 2015 he'd return to the changed world. It would be the alternate world that Marty and the Doc experienced in 1985 plus 30 years.

A real blast from the past.,"My Take: Wildly elaborate and highly imaginative.This sequel falls where everyone feared the original BACK TO THE FUTURE might fall upon. This sequel is more effects-driven than the first film, and there are more special effects here than the first film. This sequel is not as good as the first film (and that film was very good), with its lack of ingenuity and more focused on the quality of the special effects, but that doesn't mean the special effects delight upon itself. The film is still a lot of fun, and director Robert Zemekis and producer Steven Spielberg's liveliness are at an evident abundance. It is still what a sequel should be.Instead of going to the usual knock-off as any expensive sequel does, the new script by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis took some time (no pun intended) to right a new script with still numerous insightfully ingenious ideas, but often too many. The film jumps from the future, where McFly must right a few wrongs that occur with his future family, and then jumps from present to past and the explanation seems confusing that it injures the plot with heavy confusion. Although I wasn't immensely confused by it, but I know I'm not the same as all the audience who've seen it.But, still, there is so much more to enjoy in the film's visual appeal, with special effects that are elaborate and fancy, even if some of which are dated to our standards. Consulting George Lucas' ILM effects house, Zemckis and crew have made this into a very busy enterprise, but one with heart. There's a lot of imagination that went to the special effects, which seemed enough for me to be appealed. What today's special effects throughly lacked are the minds behind them. This time, the effects are well imagined, owing more to those who think them up rather than those who make them fancy.Overall, not your typical sequel. That is, because the very typical sequels are those that try their best while with so little to know about what made their predecessors so good. This one lacks what made the first film so good, but at least it makes an effort to be imaginative. I like it and I heavily recommend it.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Number 2 is not so blue.,"I was disheartened by many people before I saw this sequel to the first movie of Back to the Future. Both friends and family were telling me that it wasn't all that great. My own mother told me she couldn't follow it at all. Ha, ha! She couldn't follow Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure either.The Back to the Future sequels are just as good as the original. In fact, the second one stretches one's mind a bit to really understand from a scientific view, sort of, what it's all about. I can see people like me who really like sci-fi time travel movies enjoying this movie. Although, I can see a down to earth realist also enjoying this just as much.This movie can also be classified as a love story within a love story, an adventure through time, and a suspenseful one at that. There's mystery and intrigue along with many other facets that are just amazing. If this movie were remade today, I can only imagine how mind boggling it would be with all the new movie tricks we can do now.Don't be left in the past.

I did own a DeLorean for almost three years last decade but it never flew.

Sci-fi  going  BACK!,"It had been five years since the release of Back To The Future. In the summer of 1988, it was still very much part of the 80s way of movies. Universal came to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wanting to do two more films.The original draft of the second film would be sending Marty Mcfly and the Delorean time machine back to the 60s. However, reviewing the work, Zemeckis realized it would not work.It became apparent to the writers that making a sequel to Back To The Future would take some serious time and effort. As soon as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was complete and in theaters, Zemeckis and Gale began writing.Deciding to go into the future, the two writers decided to make the future a happy place because they felt that the future was way too often mispredicted. Not only this, but they spend time consulting with Rick Carter, the production designer on what the 'future' should look like.The rest of the film is a bit of an overlap. Marty Mcfly goes back to 1955 to prevent Biff Tannen from monopolizing Hill Valley. Every little detail was exactly the same, right down to the positioning of the actors.What makes Back To The Future Part II so unique is that you get to see parts of the first film from the prospective of another character. This had not been done in Hollywood before in a sequel.The other major part of the film is the vista glide that was used to create the dinner sequence in 2015 with Michael J. Fox ending up in three places at once for the final take. Other similar shots were simply done by cutting the film in half for scenes with two Biffs and two Doc Brown's.Back To The Future Part II takes the storyline to the next level in time travel giving the audience the chance to see what happens when there's a ripple effect in a time line.A number of the techniques used in the film give film-makers today the technology they need to create bigger and better special effects.

"Where we are going, we don't need roads!","How do you follow one of the best comedies ever made up? Well you really don´t but you try!Back to the Future part II is highly entertaining from start to finish with fun concepts, incredible set designs and an idea that feels like it´s overshadowing the original, and in there lies the problem. Back to the Future is bigger and badder than it´s predecessor, but that´s not why I loved the original. The time travel aspect was not what made the original amazing, it was the fun characters, jokes and story. This time around time travel is key, and it´s fun and well done, but it sets more focus on the ticking clock of the original movie, instead of everything around it that was the actual arterial part of the original. I should stop comparing them, but it´s hard the sequel is still fun and entertaining with incredible ideas, but it never runs as much as it should with the incredible concept it sets out to do.After Doc takes Marty to the future to prevent tings from happening, events happen that affects the past, and Mary and Doc most now try to fix everything so the present can return to its former self.The effects are surprisingly well done for the time. Not really the effects on things like the hoverboards but the green screen work still looks great. This movie is a bit of a testament to that finding the solutions to hard problems in movies, often have to be done with a sparring solution. Simple practical effects and green screen solutions are often better than going full CGI. When this movie dose the practical and sparing effects, it invokes pure movie magic, when it relies fully on effects, it looks dated.The characters and acting is over the top in this movie but that's a part of the charm. Micheal J. Fox as Marty is cute in this movie. Christopher Lloyd is over the top as always doing great here but my favorite actor here is Tom Wilson as the many Biffs. His really owning the villain role in every version and his really the best part here. It´s delightful performances that are so fun.This movie goes through a lot of different changes in terms of the time travel aspect and the set designs and production designs are great here. From the alternative timelines to the future to the different neighborhoods. The movie is so imaginative, and the future part is so fun to see here.This leads to a movie more focused on the time travel aspect of the franchise and it makes it seem much more serious and in a bigger scope. This makes the movie seem like it wanted to up the original movie, but it doesn't really go all the way with it´s concepts. Like going back to some of the original movie should have felled more nostalgic and created more tension. Also, the concept isn't as tension filled as the original somehow.The humor is still incredible here and the ideas and concepts are so well done. The humor isn't as strong as the original, but the same could be said about the writing in this movie in general. It´s a bit too forward and plot heavy but also has some heart here and there.This is a fun movie and I enjoyed it a lot. It´s a solid comedy sci-fi with great ideas, concepts and a solid production. The only thing that really brings it down, is that you kind of have to compare it to the original which makes it looks much weaker. The other weaker part is that the concept isn't done to it´s fullest potential and the overall humor can be a bit weak at times, but again, overall you have a solid fun movie here that carries the delight from the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Action-Packed,"I like all of the Back to the Future series, but Back to the Future II is the coolest. In the first one the plot is sweet, but this one is the most action-packed and suspenseful of them all. The alternate 1985 shows what can happen if you change the past, and 2015 makes you wonder what technology they'll come up with next. You've got to dig the multiple roles MJF plays in this one. Of course it's got the touches of comedy that makes the Back to the Future series. And if you like the first film, you can visit it again in the second from a different perspective--I think that that is the coolest part. A warning, though: after seeing the hyped-up technology of the second one, the third may be a shock LOL.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Not as good as the first,"This is the second film in the Back to the Future trilogy. Where the first focused more about going back into the past, this film went into the future - Marty's future. We have the same villain Biff and his gang, which does work well in this film and helps to keep the same 'feel' that the first film had. In fact, it is similar in a lot of ways, but it's not quite as good as the original. It's worth a watch, if only to see how poorly it has dated.However, there are some pretty good and funny scenes, but the original film is a lot better, and I would recommend that one over this one.

Doc and Marty head to 2015.,"The day after Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) returns from 1955, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) shows up at the McFly house to pick up Marty and intervene with an event that may destroy Marty's future family. Along with Marty's girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue), Doc and Marty head thirty years into the future. Doc has Marty take his future sons place and turn down an offer from Biff's grandson, Griff (Thomas F. Wilson) that could lead to potential trouble. Once Marty is finished with business, he picks up a ""souvenir"" that could give him an advantage back in his own time period. Doc finds the item and throws it out, but unfortunately Biff finds the discarded item and takes the Delorian back to 1955 to give the item to his younger self. Marty and Doc don't realize that this has happened until they return to 1985 and see that it is nothing like when they left.So, Doc and Marty must go back to 1955 and retrieve the item that old Biff gave to his younger self. If they are unsuccessful they will be stuck in the ""new"" 1985. Now back in 1955 there are two Doc Browns and two Marty McFlys.

BTTF II,"Going straight from where the first movie left off we get thrown into the sequel. And this by all means, is a sequel to the first. With many ''recaps'' from what we have seen and experienced in the first movie. This, combined with the story here is interesting, but does wear off after a few segments and especially if you are watching these back to back, might seem a bit too much of the good stuff. Also the story is a lot weaker here, sure, the book had influences that went further, but it never felt as engaging.In general this movie feels a lot more silly and cartoonish in it's portrayal of characters, whereas the first also had it's silly moments, most characters were played a bit more straight than here. Especially the 1985 alternate timeline was almost a parody. There are more jokes, and just more comedy in general.Now it's interesting to me that most of the modern day stuff we see or remember from BTTF is the Mattel hover board, the Nike auto lacing shoes and the weird upside-down Pepsi. It shows the power of marketing I guess, but the product placement was heavier here than I expected. That said, the products earn their notoriety for being incredibly cool products, with beautiful designs.At times we de have some rehashing of plot, another race against the clock like the last movie. Involving the same characters. Doc had less to do as well as Marty took most of the plot.The makeup for the older versions is alright, but it never sells it fully but in a sillier movie like this it didn't feel that far out of place.Regarding the prediction of how 2015 that of course already hilarious. Sadly though, I wish they were right (most things at least) Who doesn't want that hoverboard...Regarding a plot point, maybe I didn't hear it right but in the future when Marty is a loser because of a accident, that never got solved right? By trying to fix the children they only tried to treat the symptoms, not the cause. The other plot took over before that even started though. Maybe we see this in the 3rd movie.And about that, the end of the movie ends on a ''to be continued'' and this adds to the lesser impact this movie had on me. It does really feel a movie to fill the time between the finale. Contrary to something like Empire Strikes Back that has more significance in it's trilogy.Looking forward to the finale and see how they neatly wrap this up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Awesome! As good as the original!,"9/10This film is up there with T2 and Aliens as a sequel that is every bit as good as - if not better than - the original.Sure it isn't as fresh or as comedic as BTTF but seeing the characters' reactions to what happened 30 years ago in the original movie (as well as seeing them re enact them in both 1955 and 2015) is a joy to behold!And the alternate 1985? Genius. A masterstroke!Those who claim it is too confusing are either 5 years old or are in need of a lobotomy. There is no helping these people. They should be put down. For their own good.Those who try to argue the facts of time travel - it's a film, boneheads! Zemeckis and co weren't delivering a thesis on time travel so expect inconsistencies. As to actually debating whether the film is right or wrong - this is flawed anyway - as no one has travelled through time to prove their case.Though shot back to back with part III, I believe it is BTTF part I and II that should be viewed as such. In fact, they SHOULD be watched back to back - such is the close link between the two. And if you do so, the original will be fresh in your mind and you can sit stunned in awe how they recreate the exact scenes and replicate them in the various eras. As well as laugh at the continuation/reoccurence/of themes and dialogue.If you do, you can only marvel at how they recreated the same scenes, such as the 'Enchantment Under the Sea' dance and created deja vu (when Marty gets chased by Biff's gang in 2015, Biff hits the manure truck again, another Mayor Goldie Wilson etc).The recurrence of these same actions - in both 1955/2015 and BTTF and BTTF II - as well as the the repeated character interactions (teh camera looking over Biff's shoulder as he stands up to tower over Marty, ""butthead!"", ""McFly!"", ""what's the matter? Chicken?"", Marty trying to hit Biff sneakily by distracting him etc) not only create a sense that history will always repeat, which is novel anyway, but more importantly binds these two films closer together and for me, make one movie split in half, rather than an original and a sequel.As stated, II and III were shot back to back but you'd swear it was part I and II - despite the 4 year gap!For me, one of the highlights was the filling in of what happened offscreen in the original (like the high jinks that Biff and co were up to at the dance before George decked him, Biff arguing with the repair man over the cost of the treatment, further hints at Biff's obsession with Elaine when he swears that he will marry her etc).This film is genius!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads","I'm not sure what it is, but this movie doesn't quite hit the same as the first one. In my opinion, it feels a bit messy, though the visual effects are impressive for a movie made in 1989.I didn't really enjoy the acting, especially from Tom Wilson, who plays Biff Tannen. He mostly just yells. On the other hand, I really liked Christopher Lloyd's performance as Dr. Emmett Brown. He brought a lot of energy to the role.It's not a bad movie, just not as fun or engaging as the original. That said, I'm still excited to see what the third one is like.

Worthy sequel with a brilliant performance by Thomas F Wilson,"Doc, Marty and Jennifer travel to the year 2015 and cause problems in space and time.This is a strong sequel that has a number of memorable moments. It does cover a lot ground previously made by the classic original, but from a different and enjoyable perspective.The plot contains many recycled elements from the first movie but it continues the story well and puts its own unique stamp on Doc and Marty's adventure through time in Hill Valley.As with most sequels the action and spectacle is ramped up considerably with with lots more time travel and versions of the town to see. This works well, particularly in the initial 2015 scenes where we see Marty take in sights of what was then a far off look into the future. Now we are in 2021, these scenes have an additional amusement with their flying cars, hoverboards and various other future tech concepts.When disaster strikes the space time continuum, the stakes get a lot higher, more engaging and we get invested in Marty's mission to put things right. Everything ends on a great cliffhanger that makes you eager to know what comes next.This is a very visual movie that tells a story well through camerawork. It also delivers a lot more of humour through sight gags than the original. The production values are immensely high with special effects that were top class at the time of production. These all hold up well on present day viewings.All performances are excellent with a number of great multi-character/age portrayals. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd lead the cast superbly, but for me the star of the show is Thomas F Wilson who plays old Biff, two incarnations of middle-age Biff, young Biff and the wonderfully loony Griff. He is fantastic in every scene.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"This second part is a far above average experience, appropriating the original's concepts and ideas to literally expand its own universe","Back to the Future is one of the most influential films in cinema history, marking a generation and expanding its success to this day. Owner of an original plot and revolutionary effects for the time, the plot's popularity reached levels rarely seen in cinema. Originally, the idea of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis was just to close the film with an anecdote, a way to end the story by implying that the adventure continued. With the resounding success of the feature film, Universal Pictures saw the joke as a great opportunity to make more money at the box office, thus giving the go-ahead for a continuation, which would generate two more sequels. The film was produced with a budget of forty million dollars and was shot together with its continuation; filming began in February 1989, after two years of building the sets and writing the scripts. Two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells did not return. Wells abandoned her career in Hollywood and Crispin was replaced by Jeffrey Weissman who received makeup to look like Glover, so that some scenes from the original film could be reused. Except that the actor had not allowed the reuse of his scenes, he sued Spielberg and won (since then, new laws have been created in the USA on image reuse).The script presents the same structure that we saw before - the interaction between generations different at the same age - but only in the future / present and in a much more frantic way. The script is very agile, but never exactly confusing, although it may depend a little too much on expository dialogues. All this, because this adventure in the future is only the first of three in the same film. With the various comings and goings in time, and the alternative reality of 1985, some say that the plot of Back to the Future 2 is too confusing. But Doc Brown is there to explain in a very didactic way - including a blackboard and drawings - what is happening in the plot. Nothing to mess with anyone's brain.In this second part, the comedy and innovative situations proposed by the first film are replaced by unbridled, breathtaking action. Point for the duo of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis: knowing that the freshness of the original story could not be matched, the two came up with an intricate adventure, full of twists and references to the series pilot. So, when we look back at the adventures of Marty McFly in 1955, a little of the emotion that we felt previously comes back to us. An interesting point of the script is the variation over several scenes from the original film: there is a sequence just like the one in which Marty runs away from Biff on a skateboard (here the skateboard is flying, and old Biff comments: 'This seems familiar '; another in which he thinks he dreamed of everything and his mother brings him back to reality; and so on. Other scenes have been fully recreated in order to include the characters in the second film (like the one where Marty plays Johnny B. Good while another Marty sways on the scaffold over his head).
Revisiting the original film gives the audience a chance to take a different perspective on scenes we've previously seen. In addition to demonstrating the whimsy of the production, which manages to recreate scenarios and sequences in detail, we have a rare opportunity to see in another angle key moments of the original feature, such as Marty McFly's show at the Encanto Submarino ball, the clash between Biff and George in the parking lot and, of course, the best scene in the whole trilogy, the lightning bolt hitting the clock tower, the only one that is repeated in the three films. Although they took several precautions to make the visit to the original film perfect, the absence of Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (replaced by Elisabeth Shue) and Crispin Glover as George McFly (now replaced by Jeffrey Weissman, now appearing with archival images)) ended up undermining the success of the attempt. Anyway, nothing that spoils the fun, being a more noticeable detail for fans than for the general public.It is incredibly fun to imagine that a second Marty observed almost all the adventures of the first Marty and that the two Docs even talked in 1955. The idea of addressing the same events raises the potential for a temporal paradox to the tenth power, creating a real speculative source of blow the head. If the first third is fun, but flawed and the second is more flawed than fun, the third almost completely redeems the sins of Zemeckis and Gale. Merging recreations of iconic sequences with the reuse of passages from the original film, Zemeckis and Gale give a narrative show while Harry Keramidas and Arthur Schmidt simply innovate in the complicated task of assembling the work.As in the first film, the city of Hill Valley itself is an important character: it is the changes that occur in it that give the dark tone to the alternative gift created by Biff. It is worth, once again, the comparison with the small town of Happiness Is Not Buying, Bedford Falls (see the review for Back to the Future): the alternative Hill Valley would be the Bedford Falls that would exist if James Stewart's George Bailey did not had been born. Also worth mentioning is the Hill Valley of the future, a fantastic creation by the people of art direction and stage design (always together, of course, with Dean Cundey, the series' competent director of photography).There are, of course, some problems in the script, which are totally forgivable compared to the final set. For example, where did the change in Doc's behavior come from since the future is unknown? After all, he almost died, in the previous film, from not wanting to know what would happen to his future self. In Back to the Future 2, however, he takes Marty McFly to 2015 to shamelessly change the course of events. However, shortly afterwards he makes a speech about maintaining the continuum of the universe. Also, it seems that Gale and Zemeckis didn't quite know what to do with Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer: she spends most of the movie asleep. But, after all, who is she? Why did you marry Marty? (There is a hint that the wedding was not quite what she wanted, but only).According to Bob Gale and Bob Zemeckis, it was never the intention of the writers to take the story into the future - simply because it is extremely difficult to get it right. Therefore, the two decided to extrapolate when they had to follow the original joke and send the characters for 2015, thirty years in the future. For today's audiences, it's fun to watch what hit and miss the film's producers. Screenwriter Bob Gale, director Robert Zemeckis and the entire technical team, especially the art direction and costumes, had to imagine their own future and which, over time, proved capable of predicting future trends in fashion and behavior.
No flying cars, floating skateboards (hoverboards), pizzas that grow in seconds, self-adjusting and self-drying jackets, self-tie shoes. However, we can notice biometrics (several scenes in the film show people using digital to access some place or document), holograms (the one that scares Marty at the beginning of the film), drones (like the ones that take dogs for walks in Hill Valley - although not quite what we see today), video calls (another very common feature today but that was practically unthinkable in the 1980s, which we would have today technologies like Skype, Whatsapp and Facetime, for example), tablets ( at one point, Marty is introduced to a ""digital clipboard""), giant televisions (several houses and businesses have televisions with large screens), games (in his traditional cafeteria, Marty plays with some kids in a video game that captures movement and uses peripherals , similar to the current Kinect and Wii). A few years ago, Nike announced the arrival of Marty McFly's Nike Air Mag (although it lit up and had the look of the film, the shoes did not have the main characteristic of their cinematographic counterpart: the automatic laces). All the exaggerations and situations imagined in 2015 make everything even more fun so many years later.The special effects are fantastic, as is the makeup. There is a scene, for example, in which Michael J. Fox plays three different characters who interact with each other (he plays the role of Marty at 47 and his two children: a boy and even a girl). The sequence is brilliant and innovative for the time. In fact, this type of 'encounter' happens several times during the film: the two Biffs (the one from 1955 and the 2015 one; the two Doc Browns (the one from 1955 and the 1985 one) and the two McFlys (both from 1985). It's a great exercise in visual effects, with the use of the VistaGlide camera developed by IL&M, but the end result, which still has a new George McFly upside down and full of prostheses to disguise the actor change ends up becoming a sequence strange, not very well developed and cluttered with information and that would only really end in the epilogue of Part III. Gale and Zemeckis took advantage of all the opportunities they had to create scenes in which visual effects were fundamental. car details in the scenes that take place in the future, that blend wonderfully in scale with the actual footage, being put together in virtually imperceptible transitions.In a very clever way, the script ends a cycle, attenuating the impression of ""middle film"" which is a very common feature in trilogies, for obvious reasons. This second part is a far above average experience, appropriating the original's concepts and ideas to literally expand its own universe. With visual effects even better than the original and with a roller coaster rhythm, it may not be as good as the original, but it has many qualities that make it very close. Its ending is an open one, with the end of the adventures of Marty and Doc Brown taking place in Back to the Future 3 (1990), an unsuspected comic western.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"""Back to the Future 2"" is the best sequel in the history of cinema!","""Back to the Future 2"" is the best sequel in the history of cinema! The best series of the trilogy, and probably the most iconic film of my childhood. Robert Zimekis and Bob Gale did an excellent job of closing the opening ending of the first film in the most effective way with their two (filmed at the same time) sequels. ""Back to the Future 2"" does the impossible, it reimagines the iconic and just perfect original.All my favorite movie moments happen at the very beginning of the movie. The future shown in ""Back to the Future 2"" is probably the most beautiful and wonderful of all shown in the films. The future reminds me of the improved and enlightened 80s with flying cars and with the technical revolution at its maximum. It is shown not as depressive, as we say in Blade Runner or A Clockwork Orange, but as positive and cheerful.These 20 minutes of Marty McFly's future adventure (not counting the scenes at Jennifer's house) is just one mind-blowing movie moment. Seriously, everything looks so great, I would give anything to be in such a future, walk along this Hill Valley, go to the 80's Cafe, have a glass of P-Perfect and fly around the city in a car time.The general mood of the ""bad"" 1985 is filmed very well, the city resembles one of the largest and most criminal districts in the United States. The ending is no less interesting, the connection with the first series, it becomes possible to look, so to speak, into the cut scenes of the first film and look at the story from a different angle. The final scene is also unique, Thomas F. Wilson plays wonderfully. Beff is probably the best school bull ever shown in the movie.""Back to the Future"" trilogy (and especially the first 2 series) is like one big and most important film of my childhood. I remember for the first time I watched the first and second parts, probably somewhere in 1991, while still in kindergarten. These 2 films shocked me so much that even today, after many years, I can watch them endlessly, and they don't bother me. One thing is clear, unfortunately, no one will shoot anything like this.

A Worthy Time-Travel Adventure!,"After the gigantic success of Back to the Future in 1985, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale reunite for the sequel Back to the Future Part II. It received mixed reviews upon release, but it has gained a cult following in the years since release. Personally, I always enjoyed the movie. Yes, it does have an extremely complicated plot with many different time frames and paradoxes and whatnot. But if you want to avoid a headache and be take in for a wild ride, it may be best to shut off your brain for two hours. The movie had enough jokes to take the film into screwball territory at times. I still find the interactions between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd to be gold. What surprised me and the audience in 1989 was how dark the film became when our heroes ventured back in the '85 world. I thought they entered the world of Blade Runner but no, that is just part of the plot. I liked their depiction of 2015. Gale and Zemeckis weren't trying to predict the future, but they got some things right. They admitted that they knew there would be no flying cars by 2015, but you gotta have them, right? I dug the positive vibes that were seen in the film's version of 2015. Have y'all seen Jaws 19 yet?The original picture never meant to get a sequel. It had so much success at the box office that there was no choice in the mind of the studio. Zemeckis would not return unless Fox and Lloyd were back. Funnily enough, Fox was not aware of the sequel until he saw the end credits which said the team would be back. Gale and Zemeckis came up with idea of time paradoxes which would allow them to go back to 1955 and see those events from a different light. There were some stumbling blocks. Crispin Glover did not return over money issues, so they decided to use Glover's likeness. He was angry and sued the producers. Now there are clauses in the SAG collective bargaining agreement that bans movies from using likenesses of actors without permission. That is a shame Glover could not return because he was part of the first film's magic. In addition, Claudia Wells who originally played Jennifer was replaced by Elizabeth Shue. They had to reshoot the first film's ending with the different actress. These are slight blemishes the team faced trying to get the film produced. In order to be more cost effective, they shot this and the third film back-to-back. It was not a wild success at the box office, but it was still made some decent financial returns.The film truly excels with the production design and visual effects. Rick Carter wanted to give the film a darker look, something deeper than the typical Blade Runner look. I loved how they created 2015 and the alternate 1985 world. For this particular film, ILM entered digital compositing and using the motion control camera system for the first time. This allowed camera movement in one of the more complex scenes where Fox portrayed three characters at once (in a really humorous sequence). In the 2015 world, we can play that game ""was it invented or was it not?"" I think they have a good track record in what inventions the film displayed when compared to reality.The sequel picks up right where the original film ended with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd), and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) going to 1985 to help Marty's and Jennifer's children. When they completed what they needed to do, they return to their time...but it is not quite how they left it. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) owns a bigshot casino and is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty finds out that his dad died years before. Doc concludes that Biff used a sports almanac from the future to bet on sports scores to amass his fortune. Apparently, future Biff stole the DeLorean and went to his younger self with the almanac. Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to the school dance to retrieve the book. Marty cannot be seen by Doc's younger self. But if Marty is called a coward, even more trouble may arise.The film is paced by Fox's and Lloyd's frenetic energy. There is more screwball comedy, but they keep the same energy possessed in the first film. I love when Chris Lloyd goes over-the-top as Doc. If you find yourself lost by any plot points, the performances should at least keep you grounded. I was very interested in Wilson's portrayal as the many Biffs seen throughout. One thing for sure, he knows how to keep Biff an unlikable character.I'm glad Back to the Future Part II is getting more love today. It is not a great nor original as the first film. Does it have it to be? It was nice just being back in the same world as these beloved characters. The plot can be borderline incomprehensible at times, but the characters make up for that especially with an added screwball element. The visual effects and production design take advantage of the latest technology to create memorable images. Robert Zemeckis created a magical franchise. And do I need to say anything about Alan Silvestri's fantastic score?My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

It may even be more fun to watch at this point than the first one, and maybe that's because so much of the first one is included in this one anyway, it's sort of like bonus edition. There are some genuine thrills here too as the sports almanac Biff vs. Marty plot device really pays off nicely. The only sad thing about this one is that it turns ends with a cliff hanger and a preview of part three. A terrible way to end a film (I think).

Wonderfully cool second part,"Marty (Fox) and the Doc (Lloyd) get trapped in an alternative 1985 where Biff (Wilson) runs the town and so the pair must recapture a book that must reclaim the future The sequel to suppress all others, one that could match the fantastic unique attempt to depict time travel? With enough comedy and enough planning to rule all of time, Bob Gale and Rob Zemeckis brought another provocative film to the table in the sequel to Back to the Future with Marty and the Doc having another fast flowing tense adventure through time.You can almost forget your comparisons with Dr Who's and Donnie Darko's as this picture proves once more that the DeLorean adventures really do give a knockout effect of unconditional action entertainment for the entire family.Repeating the end scenes from the previous release Part II follows the Doc and Marty to 2015 where Marty's kid is on the brink of ruining his life, and only Marty's intervention can save his family.As with the original this sequel deals in the complexities of intervention and careful treading through key situations. In an almost freakish manor Marty Junior is presented as the spitting image of his father and after a few tasteful jokes and a hard beating, Marty attempts to save his son from ruining his life. What follows is the best sequence from the trilogy in my personal opinion as Marty grabs a hover-board and like the first picture attempts a getaway from Griff's gang as they chase him through the streets. This sequence is a wonderful action orientated thriller with wonderfully staged set ups including a mistimed use of the small water section and the usual inclusion of manure.From here things start to heat up as Biff travels back in time and supplies his earlier self with a book that makes him rich and powerful, ultimately changing the complexion of 1985 when the Doc and Marty return.The knowledge of science and unfound knowledge of time travel is as ever present as the Doc once more confides his knowledge about alternate universes and the implications of changed events and how this now affects them. Once more the pair has to journey back to the exact same day in 1955 without running into themselves from their previous adventure. All this technicality and judgement marks some juicy 'almost' moments and somehow gives the events of the previous film more spring and fluidity.Once more Michael J Fox delivers the cool of all cool to cement his character well and truly in the history books. His hover-board abilities make him even more likable and this confrontation marksmanship of ""Are you chicken?"" allows him to delve into obsequious mode and with Christopher Lloyd similarly exuberant as the previous instalment, we have another fantastic family film that excels in entertainment and whilst it isn't as free and experimental as the first, is still a timeless masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part II,"By 2020, we haven't advanced the imagination in the film. In the past, science fiction films always imagined that there would be flying cars in the near future. As a result, many places in our country are far more advanced than those described in science fiction films. Only in terms of transportation, we can't break through where we went in 1985. It's hard to overcome the hurdle of flying cars that science fiction movies believe every family must have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A Wonderful film,"Now before i tell you about this great movie and everything about it, i just went to tell you how much i love it. Everything about it is just dose so well, it really feels like it's going deeper into the would that we were all found in Back to the Furture Part 1 and get to see more and more of it.Part 2 carry on where Part 1 left off, Doc (Christopher Lloyd) comes back to take, his friend Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Marty's girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) into the year 2015, when they get there Doc tells Marty (After Doc knocks her out) that he much help his future son get out of a big mess with Griff, Biff grandson (Tom F. Wilson). Aftler a lot of mess with Griff and his buddy's Marty decides to buy a book to help him win some money in his time. But when Doc see it he says that they must not mess about with time, so he puts it in the bin and they walk away. But when they do go, Old Biff comes out and takes the book himself. Well i don't want to give away to much,but just to give you a little idea of what the film is about.Also i wish to say that Part 2 asks a lot of interesting ideas and some dakl suff in it, which is another thing i love about this film, it makes you think which is what all great si-fi should do.Well i hope you like as much as i do (which is a lot) as i hope you would like to see too, and i think Part 2 better then Part 1 and i loved the first one, but i loved the second one even more.

BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II (1989) - 21/11/2019,"While it doesn't have the charm as from the first one, this is still a good follow up to one of the best movies ever made. The humour is probably the best thing about this, I think the humour is slightly better than the first. To have it set in the future then when they go back, they finds out that it's a parallel timeline then they have to go back to the past to solve the timeline is a good concept for this type of film. Michael J. Fox is great as always in these films, definitely the heart beat of this franchise.Mitchell Bulfin",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Let's go back to the future again!,"Back to the Future Part II has a storyline that is almost more interesting than the original film's. In it, the idea of alternate time lines is introduced. This is handled admirably: the situations that Marty and Doc get into are inventive, creative, original, daring, bold, exciting, and all the rest of it. But one serious, serious flaw permeates the entire film.Here is the problem: the film is far too serious. It's too dark, it's too menacing, it's too (dare I say it?) intimidating. The original Back to the Future was pure, unadulterated fun. Part II follows the trend of nearly every trilogy after the highly successful Star Wars series: the first film is fun, the second is extremely dark, the third will often return to the original's spirit. This worked for Star Wars, but not Back to the Future. Had it been any other film, this would've ended up so much better— Back to the Future should be a lot of fun to watch. Part II was more thoughtful and contemplative, and although the film was strong, it did not feel like the same series or the same director.The Verdict: A very strong, well-made, original, and well thought-out sequel, but without the spirit of fun that made the original such a blazing success.Overall Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The sequel is even more better,"How can it not be better than Back to the Future? It is. 1955, 1985 or 2015? 2015. 1955 does not have much. You saw what 2015 looks in this movie at the start. Amazing! The future looks cool with all this wicked s^^^ You know manure ;) Ask Biff Tannen :) It's passed 2015 now and look LOL!!! What happened? I'm waiting for those Hoverboards and Jaws thing. More like in 2070. I like Griff Tannen, Biff's Grandson, but who is Biff's wife? I liked the old-man Biff. Can't believe how much he has aged :) I like that Elisabeth Shue is in this second movie. She should've been in Back to the Future also. I liked to have seen more of the dog Einstein in this second movie particular. This is going to be the most popular Back to the Future movie heading into the future like in 2070 onwards ;)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Masterpieces,"Both films, Part I and II are masterpieces. Zemeckis is an actual genius, as displayed by how many great (and different genre) classic movies he made. For him to make so many perfect to near perfect movies exemplifies his brilliance. How does someone make three movies in a row about time travel without hardly having any misstep (at least noticeable one), and yet all three movies are coherent, fun, and enjoyable? It's simply amazing.While Part I will be most peoples' favorite, Part II is also amazing, especially due to the final ten minutes and the whole endeavor to bring order back to 1985 after Biff's success and crookedness turns Hill Valley upside down. The complexity of the strategy and ramifications Doc and Marty have to execute to restore normality to the future is very good writing and clever. One of the great parts is seeing all of the writing changed once Marty burns the almanac, and then when a mysterious man delivers a letter in the rain to Marty after the Delorean is struck by lightning. Also, seeing Strickland defend his house from the drive by in Biff's 1985 was funny and fun.While not as smooth as Part I, Part II is more complex and explores the dark side of time travel more in depth, culminating in an astonishing final ten minutes that turn it, too, into a masterpiece.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

incredible special effects!,"Rating:***1/2out of ****the second in the trilogy is the most sophisticated, and has futuristic objects such as vehicles which can fly and hoverboards which can fly and hover in the air!, however the film has very few laughs. The film begins when Doc. Brown bringgs Marty and his girlfriend to 2015 in time for marty to have his own son, a and buys an sports almanac as a souvenier without knowing the effect it could have bringing a gift from the future. However when he leaves it behind biff who has grandson Griff, steals it and goes back to 1955, meanwhile when Marty returns to 1985 his home is inhabited by a family who mistakes him as an intruder, and finds out that Biff used the sports almanac to become one of Americas wealthiest people owning Buisnesses in Hill Valley, and married Marty's mother after having his father killed back in 1973, so Doc discovers that the only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 and eliminate the almanac before Biff can become rich. the scences in 1985 are dark and downbeat, and Biff's character is threatining,but viewers will have great suspense in the scences where marty becomes a spy in 1955, and the film has a great hoverboard finale, if I told you anything else I'd spoil the excitement of this great Sci-fi flik which was released four years after the original.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Paradoxes in future and past,"I liked a lot this movie. The fact they travel to the future and the past to prevent horrible things happen just makes a great movie. However, there were certain things I didn't like:Jennifer is now played by another actress, so that makes the storyline act with no sense.These paradoxes appear:--If Biff traveled to the past and gave himself the almanac, making another 1985, Marty and Doc wouldn't ever have traveled to 2015 because Marty wouldn't have known Doc, because he's in a hospital. If they never traveled to 2015, that would make impossible for Biff to travel to 1955. That is, a paradox in time.--Now that Biff is rich and put Doc in a hospital he wouldn't be able to create the Time Machine, making impossible for the future Biff to travel. Another paradox.--If now exists another 1985, with the rich Biff and Marty's dad dead, Jennifer wouldn't be able to see future's Marty's dad, when she's in her future house.--Jennifer sees her future self. Why the future self is surprised of seeing the 1985 Jennifer? It's obvious that the future Jennifer was sometime the 1985 Jennifer, so she knows that she will find the 1985 Jennifer in her house. But no, she's surprised.--If Doc and Marty go to the past, and prevent Biff be rich with the almanac, and the normal 1985 returns, then the normal 1985 Marty and Doc wouldn't have a reason to travel because they do not know that the almanac exist. In that reality, Doc's and Marty's travel would end when they returned to the 1985 (that was the alternative one, but since that now is normal, they don't have to return) Then they didn't travel to the past to prevent Biff having the book. That's a great paradox.But even though all that, is a good movie. I liked it a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Back to the Future Part II - A Time-Traveling Triumph,"Great Scott! Buckle up, flux capacitor charged, because we're hurtling back to 1989 with Back to the Future Part II! As a fellow BTTF fanboy, I gotta admit, this sequel holds a special place in my DeLorean-shaped heart. But does it capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, or is it destined to fade into the dusty corners of cinematic history? Let's hit the gas and find out!First things first, the good stuff: This movie is a time-traveling joyride, packed with even more mind-bending twists and turns than a Doc Brown invention convention. Zipping between 1985, 2015 (a future that feels eerily prescient in 2024!), and an alternate 1985, the story is a wild, imaginative romp that keeps you glued to the screen. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprise their iconic roles with effortless charm, their comedic timing and on-screen chemistry as Marty McFly and Doc Brown never missing a beat. Plus, Biff's transformation into a power-hungry tycoon in the alternate 1985 is deliciously villainous, adding a healthy dose of peril to the fun.Even with its minor flaws, Back to the Future Part II is a timeless classic. It's a testament to the power of imagination, friendship, and good old-fashioned fun. It might not be as groundbreaking as its predecessor, but it's still a hilarious, heartwarming adventure that will leave you grinning from ear to ear (and maybe even humming the Power of Love theme song).Verdict: 8 out of 10 plutonium rods. Back to the Future Part II might not be as groundbreaking as the original, but it's still a time-traveling triumph fueled by humor, heart, and the enduring legacy of Marty McFly and Doc Brown. Just remember, even if the future isn't exactly what we expected, the power of friendship and a good DeLorean can still take you on an unforgettable ride. Now, where's that flux capacitor...?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Beneath a Wild Vision of the Future Lies a Flawed Sequel,"When it debuted in the winter of 1989, this sequel's wide-eyed portrait of the future was so ambitious and dramatic that it was tough to look beneath the surface. Today, a mere four years removed from the distant year 2015 depicted on the screen, those predictions seem more like a creative writing essay from the science fiction magazines of the 1950s. They remain endearing and entertaining, but in a different way - the jokes still work, but the more serious elements either don't play or, worse, come off as pure camp. And, with the shiny veneer of that potential future relegated to nothing more than a running series of sight gags, the holes and flaws of the plot itself find themselves stripped bare. It came as something of a shock to me, given my fond memory, but this really is not a good film. What screen time the cast doesn't spend breathlessly explaining the plot (which is, perhaps, fifty percent of the film) is devoted to revisiting several of the best scenes from the first movie, rather than creating fond memories of their own. It's an overly elaborate story, unashamedly building to the simultaneously-filmed follow-up, that has neither the steady pace nor the genuine charm of the original. Plot holes the size of a steam engine are the least of its concerns, given that the first film managed to be such a success in spite of similar problems.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back Two The Future! Classic!,"Back To The Future is one of my favourite franchises from the amazing time cinema was at it's best.. the eighties! As far as sequels go I quite enjoyed this one, sequels are infamously known to ruin the classic tale with a rushed script and sometimes not even the original leading cast, something that everyone 90% of the time hope for.I think Michael J. Fox fits the role of Marty perfectly, his chemistry with Doc. Brown (Chrisopher Lloyd) works very well. I try not to include spoilers so i won't include any story relation but i will say that after seeing the first, you most definitely have to check out the second and maybe even the third. That is if you feel as invested in the story as I am, even then I think its outright impossible not to be.Highly recommend! Quite an enjoyable addition to the franchise that is everything it had to live up to be, another great classic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Repetitively original,"Doing seemingly the same thing in a whole new way, and then completely subverting your expectations. This is what's in store in Back to the Future Part II.This movie is brilliant on almost every level. The way the camera merges the same characters together in the 1955 sequences is mind-blowing to me in just how seemless it feels. The 'older them' makeup is sublime throughout, the fashion representing each timeline is great (although wonderfully weird in the 2015 sequences), and the alternate 1985 sequences are surprisingly dark but still manages to be entertaining. The stand out performance has got to be from Thomas F Wilson, who manages to perfectly play numerous versions of the same character Biff as well as Griff. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox continue to entertain as Doc and Marty, and the audience is able to get more of how their present day versions of each other get along, compared to the first movie where it was mostly present day Marty and 1955 Doc.The only thing I can't shake is that I feel like not all the time travel logic is on par with the original movie. There are more rules, some of them make sense, and some others feel like they were made to justify why some events can happen and others can't.Overall, a perfect follow-up that manages to be nearly as spectacular as its predecessor, that promises to be concluded in an entertaining fashion in Part III.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Reasonable Sequel,"As with many blockbuster movie trilogies, the first installment of the Back to the Future series stood perfectly fine on its own. Technically, it did end with a cliffhanger, but it was a joke cliffhangerone final gag in a series of romps. No viewer had any particular reason to expect the story to continue. But there was too much money at stake, and so not one but two sequels were produced. And that mock cliffhanger became a real springboard to further adventures. In a strange way, the plot device of Part IIwherein the craven Biff Tannen steals Marty McFly's idea of using info from the future to make a monetary killingparallels the filmmakers' visit back in time to mine more money from their original box office goldmine. As faithful readers (and other intelligent people) know, sequels are meant to retell the original story while giving the illusion of advancing the original story. This sequel did something quite clever in literally revisiting the original movie and watching the action from a different perspective. (The mixing of old footage and new action presaged what director Robert Zemeckis would later do, more elaborately, in Forrest Gump.) It also paid homage to one of the most homage-paid movies of history, It's a Wonderful Life, by having our hero Marty McFly witness the dire fate of his home town in an alternate reality. The film is rife with in jokes, like when Michael J. Fox is startled by a holographic ad for Jaws 19. Tweaking the films' producer, Steven Spielberg, he mutters, ""Shark still looks fake."" And, just as the first film ends with a mock cliffhanger, this one ends with a real one. As with the second Star Wars movie, audiences were put on notice that they would have to wait for another movie to be released to find out what happens next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Painful to watch!,"Well, we know from the first movie that everybody involved in this can act, so I guess the fault lies in the direction and writing. Both the younger and older versions of the characters are so cartoonishly overwrought that they smack of an acting class exercise. How do you act old? Hunch your back and talk in a creaky voice. How do you act young? Pretend like you've burned half your brain cells. The aging makeup looks like plastic Halloween masks. The writing? Overflowing with ridiculous exposition dumps that come nowhere close sounding like actual speech. The dinner scene at Old Marty's house is especially egregious.

Great sequel movie,"When this first came out, I saw it in theatres and will never forget I instantly liked it better than Part I, as great as that one is, too. Although some people I went to the theatre with didn't like it because they got very confused about what was going on and following everything, I kept up with all of it and really appreciated how complicated it was.The one weakness upon rewatching it recently for the first time in decades which stood out was the very beginning when they first arrive in the future with Griff. It was a little bit ""too"" goofy and went over the top, unlike classic BTTF subplots, which always seem to toe the line just right to prevent that.However, my favorite part of this movie is definitely the very end. I think that's why I liked it so much. It was awesome and suspenseful how the car pulled up just after the storm and how that whole scenario played out, in addition to the twenty minutes that led up to it with Marty completing his mission back to 1955 undercover. If not for the first half hour of this movie, it would be just about perfect.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Can One Particular Scene Ruin An Entire Movie?,"The only reason why I am reviewing Back to the Future part 2 is because there has been something that has been bothering me. If old man Biff has succeeded in getting the book to his younger self, should he have returned back to the future in the alternate 2015 timeline? The answer is yes, therefore, hindering practically the rest of the movie after this event occurred obsolete. The DeLorean that old man Biff drove should've never returned to Marty McFly and Doctor Brown at all. The movie should've ended with Doctor Brown and Marty McFly dicking around trying to rescue Jennifer. Wah wah wah wah waaaaaaah!

What fun!,"This film does have some drawbacks, but it is a really fun one. There are so many interesting twists and turns (if you are willing to believe the unbelievable) and so many interesting characters, that it really made me regret not having watched the first. And now, I also want to watch the third.Don't let the fact that it is unrealistic bother you though. I don't think the writers were aiming for scientific accuracy, but just a good time (for which they can claim victory).What I didn't like about it was the violence and profanity, plus a few weak acting moments. I know a lot will not be put off by those first two I mentioned, but they really take away from my enjoyment of a film, and in this case the profanity was completely unnecessary and the violence could have at least been toned down.The acting for the Biff and Griff characters was too one-dimensional for me and (what's-her-name?) Marty's mom was just not believable in any but her younger scenes, which are brief. (Even though the situation is unbelievable the character acting still should be.) But, regardless of those things, this film is still a lot of fun, especially for sci-fi lovers. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox never disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads...","And so, the adventure continues, thrusting Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) into another trip through time to change the future.

This movie is non-stop suspense from start to finish. Once it starts, it never lets up and you're constantly on the edge of your seat. However, this sequel doesn't measure up to the first film. Part II has some casting changes that really irritate me, but they're acceptable. The roles in question are small parts anyway, but I still think that Claudia Wells is a way better Jennifer than Elizabeth Shue. The replacement for Crispin Glover is more acceptable, though, because the scenes he's in are so small that if you blink, you'll miss him.

"Faster paced, louder and zanier than the first...not always a good thing.","The first Back to the Future film is very silly and not meant to be taken seriously. It's fast paced and full of goofy and zany acting. The first film leveled itself out with excellent pacing, and heart where it needed it. The movie is fast paced, but it's the right level of it, and gives itself time to cool down with scenes of dialogue. This movie starts, and it keeps going till it's over. This is one of the fastest paced movies ever, with a lot of stuff happening. There is no time to cool down in this movie as it keeps it's pace for almost two hours! With that said, it's still pretty effective as a sequel!Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) travel forward in time to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher LLoyd) so Marty can help prevent his future son from becoming a criminal. After several occurrences, some caused by Marty himself, Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) has his hands on both a sports statistics book that gives stats through 2000, and on the Delorean. After going back to 1985 where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley owning a huge casino, is married to Marty's mother (Lea Thompson), and Marty's father is dead. What ensues is a trip back to the 50s to stop this ever from happening.This movie has some really impressive sets. 2015 Hill Valley is a great set, and an excellent variation on the 1985 and '55 version. The Biff hotel set is another really cool looking and impressive set, and everything about the settings of this movie are really atmospheric. Normally this is something you don't even notice about movies, but here the aesthetics are a real positive.The movie starts off really well, and the ridiculously fast pacing isn't a problem. Set piece 2015 is fast paced, fine, then we get back to the fast paced 1985 Biff takeover, which is fine. It's once we get back to the 1950s where this movie becomes somewhat tedious and despite it's quick pace, it grows slightly boring. The zaniness is here more than in the first movie too. The Doc is zany, Marty is zany, Biff is zany...in fact, everything is so slapstick and silly it grows somewhat annoying. Even the scene that the trailer eagerly showed off Michael J Fox playing Marty, future Marty, Marty Jr., and Marlene McFly is sort of annoying because every character in the scene is really loud, like each character is trying to one up the last one. And that's one of the major problems in this movie is how loud every character is. Constant yelling does not mean hilarious performances.The acting, despite being too over the top at times is as good as the first. Thomas F Wilson plays a pretty convincing bad guy, and definitely knows how to be evil well. Michael J Fox and Christopher LLoyd also give excellent performances, along with the ensemble cast.Overall, this is a very good sequel. It's not up to par with the first, and grows annoying at times, but it's still an excellent second part to an excellent trilogy.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins, PG for language and violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Turbulent yet Still Amusing,"The biggest problem with 'Back to the Future 2' is the pacing. The opening act is not done right and is far too rushed to fully develop a sense of excitement and meaning.

Christopher Lloyd doesn't have a lot to do this time around and his character's development is almost nil. Tom Wilson is much more of a star this time around is clearly having a lot of fun.Mistakes were made in the writing of this sequel, and it becomes more noticeable with each rewatch.

One of the credit i wan to give to Christopher Lloyd aka DOC, the acting of this guy in this movie is just authentic, this is how scientist looks like and works in really life, i really loved the way he has performed just as pure scientist, he just portrayed the character so politely and don't you forget about the Michael J. Fox he is also skillful guy.Movie has so many twists and so many breathtaking scenes which you would admire for sure and movie is at his best. The thing that took me to is when they got back to the 1995, they have showed it exactly the same way which was showed in part one and those were absolutely best scenes i have ever encountered.

Did Anyone Note the Smart Phone in 1989???,"In the opening scenes,Doctor Emmett Brown at 7:46 holds up a device that looks just like a smart phone. It is crazy. There is no way in 1989 the producers could ever imagine in the future there would be a device that looked exactly like this and it would be a phone! It's really eerie when you think about it. This is a movie about the future and it is 2015, and he is holding a device exactly like we use today in 2015. At 7:53 in the movie he holds it up and we see some hot chicks (that will always be a constant) and he might as well be holding my LG Smart Phone...it looks exactly like it. Weird right? If they only knew what they stumbled upon. There is some prop dude that was brilliant. Who knew...maybe an engineer was a fan of these movies and copied the design? Likely! Some dude had to come up with a prop and he might have been the inspiration of a phone revolution. That's history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Don't mess with the timeline!!,"In some respects this film supersedes the first as it includes much more time travelling, but as it is a sequel it has to come a close second to its original.
It could get easily complicated for some as it jumps backwards and forwards and even I lost track of why they couldn't do this, that or the other without effecting the timeline.I still love Michael J Fox and those jeans, Christopher Lloyd gets more screen time and we get to go to the future as well as the past, but Griff/Biff, Mum and Dad are still a bit over the top. However I do like the symmetry with the previous film and the repetition of the same jokes and situations.I wish 2015 was anywhere near as advanced as this film depicts and I want those shoes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to Back to the Future,"Since Part II and Part III of this franchise were shot together does that mean we can refer to it as Back to Back Back to Back to the Future?The paradoxes don't end there. They've not even begun yet. The fact that Part II contradicts the laws of 4-dimensional physics laid down in the first movie is not a problem unless you want it to be. There are a lot of wannabe smart-asses out there who think they are overnight geniuses for picking plot holes in Part II. Robert Zemeckis has said that it is the most complex film he has ever made. I think that the complicated nature of the story, the dark middle act, and abrupt cliffhanger perhaps alienate some of the more simple viewers and that has led to Part II being the most underrated and misunderstood of the series.It's also my favorite for those exact reasons, and more.Like the first movie Part II is an icon of a now past future. It may have got some predictions laughably incorrect but it did get many frighteningly accurate. Video phones came true, hover- boards entered pop culture, and a madman with bad hair became the most powerful man in the world. But since this all exists in a timeline manipulated by Marty and Doc it is all in its own universe and therefor plausible. Who's to say that it wasn't Doc Brown himself who invented the technology of flying cars.With the distractions of visual effects, action scenes, and complex stories it is easy for one to forget that the Back to the Future movies are comedies. It is my personal opinion that Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover were robbed of Academy Awards in 1986 (does anyone give a crap about William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman or Don Ameche in Cocoon?). They were not even nominated. Doc Brown and George McFly are characters that stay with you. However, Part II is Thomas F. Wilson's time to shine and he absolutely dominates this movie. Biff Tannen is my favorite character of the series - a lunkhead bully, cruel just for the sake of being cruel, who is so dumb that even his older self is bemused by his stupidity. While Marty and Doc are the leads it is Biff who is the comedic heart of the series.There are weakness though. Silvestri's score for this entry is the worst of the series - full of underscoring and tension with very little in the way of excitement outside of the opening and closing credits. I'm not entirely satisfied with Doc's silly ""it's just a big coincidence"" explanation for old Biff going back to November 5th 1955 either. I know it' supposed to be a joke but I think a smarter reason would be that the date would have been stored in the time circuits and Biff simply selected it because it seemed appropriate. But I'm being far too pedantic.The best scene in all of the Back to the Future movies is without a doubt the lightning striking the clock tower while Marty and Doc struggle to send the 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor. The editing and timing of this is absolutely perfect down to the last frame. Not only do we get to experience it again in Part II but it even continues with the other Marty interrupting Doc's celebration. I first saw this movie in Summer 1990 while on a long plane journey so the trailer for Part III at the end wasn't so much a tease for me. I only had to wait about a week before I was sitting in the cinema watching it.Fun times. If only I could go back and relive it again...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
More Time Travelling Shenanigans,"After the success of Back to the Future Universal Studios believed that they had the potential franchise on their hands. This despite Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale thinking they finished the first film perfectly well. But despite this they continued with their baby and explained on the original idea.Back to the Future Part II begins with the last scenes of the first film, with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) to 2015. Doc Brown wanted Marty to save his son and family from disaster. But whilst in the future, a 77-year-old Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) sees them and their time machines. Whilst on their mission he goes back to 1955 and his younger self a book of sports statistics. When 'Doc' and Marty return to 1985 they discover history has changed, with Biff becoming a multi-billionaire, controlling Hill Valley and married Marty's mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty and Doc have to return to 1955 and destroy the book and do it without interfering with Marty's first trip.They is no way Back to the Future Part II could ever match the first film with originality or wit, but it is still a fun little film. Robert Zemeckis shows his skills as a special effects director and for making fun family films with warmth and passion. He knows he has a tough job on his hands and just makes the film fun, mixing comedy and action with great effort. Zemeckis and Gale explain on ideas that the first film set up about time travel and parallel time lines which have continued into further films, TV series and cartoons. Zemeckis was also able to mix new scenes with scenes from the first film to great effort and has some of the best comedic moments in the film. I also enjoyed the scene between the two Docs. They is also a good joke about the Jaws Series. Zemeckis also copies what Steven Spielberg did with Indiana Jones, making the second film darker to the first. This doesn't work but I give the director points for trying. Fox, Lloyd and Wilson also enjoy the roles they are in, all are very good in the series. The Back to the Future series is possibly Fox's best work as an actor.A perfectly enjoyable film",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Better than the Original!,"The second part of the trilogy begins as Doc, Marty and Jennifer take the time-traveling DeLorean into the year 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. But Biff Tannen steals the time machine and gives his younger self a book containing 50 years of sports statistics, which the young Biff uses to amass an enormous gambling fortune and transform idyllic Hill Valley into a living hell. To restore the present, Doc and Marty must return to the events of their previous adventure in 1955 and retrieve the book.It may be quite obvious that this film had a bigger budget than the first film. The visuals are much more extensive and great! And this is the best movie out of the trilogy! Why? Unlike the first and third films, the second is not only the most complicated, but probably one of the most complicated time travel movie I've ever seen! This movie surly makes you think! I loved it!It goes back and forth with bumps and bruises (which is a good thing). Also, I love the way how it was like ""Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban"". You see dopplegangers and characters trying to hide themselves.This film is much more exciting and you have tons of fun!All in all, as I said, it is the best in the trilogy.

Best of the three,"When I saw this movie at the Cinema as a teen in blew me away. I was so exited and intrigued after seeing it, I went and hired the original just so I could work out and relive all the story lines from the original.The movie picks up where 1 left off. The Doc has to go to 2015 to solve some of future Marty's problems. When Marty disregards Doc's implicit instructions, things go haywire, causing all sorts off extra disasters that catapult the guys back into 1955.There's lots of clever retro themes, some great lines and the story is action packed. Look for the café 80's scenes, which technologically were amazing when they first appeared.Unfortunately there was a third installment in the series, set in the wild west which was just woeful. It nearly ended in disaster in real life for Michael J Fox too, when a hanging scene went horribly wrong and Fox came within inches of losing his life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Back to the Future part2,"This movie is an great nostalgic masterpiece for every nation or age. I'll give an 10/10 for all three pictures... ""Plot holes: In the future, old Biff steals the time machine to travel back to 1955 and give his younger self the almanac. When he returns to the future (and crashes into the trash cans) it is the same future as he had left even though it should have been an alternate future in which he was rich"".But in my opinion, the old Biff on his way back to the normal future, should disappear at all, because changing future of young Biff he is changing his own life (and the future environment) the old Biff is not part of it anymore. And he's personal experiences have never happened, so his development stops at the same moment when the young Biff even touched the magazine. The new future belongs now to the young Biff who got the Sport magazine. So the DeLorean should stay in 1955 or flew (if he disappear on it's way) empty to the bad future.Plot hole: If you take all three pictures and put them together that you'll realize that we see maybe 2 week's of the life of Marty McFly. In the beginning he is an shy virgin, which is waiting for his first shot, in all period (of three movies) he has no chance to start his sexual experience. But in the film his character changing very quick in an experienced macho. It is impossible for any person to change in a week or two so fast. Even if the life events are going very fast, the mind of the person needs time to put it all together. My point is that this movie was made 1985, 1989 and 1990. Time gap of 5 years, during making the movie M.J. Fox grew up and changed the personage into a brave macho guy. So the story period is to short to make such change, M.J.Fox needed 5 years and Marty McFly only a 2 week's.Same impossible change you can see in The Lords of The Rings. Periode of the story is only a week top. But in the beginning Frodo is afraid to even touch the sword and the following movies he's cutting demos like butter.

The future that I want to see so much,"The end of the first film gave an unambiguous answer - to continue to be. And now in the new film, the plot sends the characters into the future. At the time of the film's release, it was incredibly cool to see 2015, which is shown to us in the film. I remember every viewing of this trilogy and a clear feeling that has remained to this day - Back to the Future 2 is the best of all three films for me. Precisely because you see the future there. Excellent visual solutions, by the way, allowed the film to be nominated for an Oscar for best effects. The scriptwriters and the director perfectly saw what their world of the future would be like, paying attention to details. And the legendary pink skate that flew straight through the air will forever remain a childhood dream for millions of children of that time.The actors' acting is on top again. It doesn't matter that the actress playing Jennifer was replaced, it didn't affect the perception at all. The actress perfectly fit into the team, making her heroine a part of the universe Back to the Future.Marty McFly appears as an older copy of himself. Makeup helps to show age. After all, it's been 30 years. But the main thing that I noticed for myself, the actor's acting is his eyes. Fox did a great job with the image of the father of the family, who has already lived a life, has seen a lot. I think it's the actor's merit to convey the age of the hero in this way.Dr. Brown is in his repertoire. Still wild and purposeful. Lloyd shines on the screen, not letting you take your eyes off him for a second. He is here on a mission to save the future of his younger friend's family, once again showing friendship what it should be.Tanons are colorful as always, unpleasant, as befits antiheroes. Thomas Wilson more than copes with several roles at once, giving each character its own uniqueness.The movie is quite dynamic. Adventures switch from one event to another, and the explanation of confusing moments with time travel allows you not to lose the thread of the narrative. And of course, the sequel was obliged to raise the bar, which was done when, in the interweaving of storylines, the heroes of this film were not supposed to meet themselves from the past. And every scene that was almost frame-by-frame reproduced is a pleasure when you realize how responsibly the creators of the picture approached this work.The music is back on top. To this day, Alan Silvestri's melody makes you smile mentally when footage from the film pops up in front of your eyes.The movie is bright and interesting. It is perfect for family viewing, giving an excellent couple of hours in the piggy bank of life.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
it throws probability out the window in favor of more gadgets and plot complications...and amazingly comes off as almost as exciting as the original,"""Back to the Future: Part II"" is an exhilarating sequel to a modern-day classic. Throwing out all sense of believability and probability in favor of making it zanier and more random than its marvelously-plotted predecessor, remarkably, it comes across as almost as equally entertaining. Picking up where the first film left off, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel forward in time in order to correct tragic future events, all the while becoming more and more aware of the dangers of time travel. Their fears turn to reality when, in the future, an elderly Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) steals the Flux Capacitor-equipped DeLorean and adjusts his own past to make an alternative reality in which he rules in a dystopian dictatorship. When discovering what happens, it is up to Marty to once again travel to 1955, avoid ruining what he fixed the first time, and correcting things for the future. It sounds complicated, but that's only because it is.""Part II"" and the third sequel in this Robert Zemeckis trilogy are liable to disappoint a fair percentage of people, especially if they are admirers of the original. The first ""Back to the Future"" is one of Robert Zemeckis's masterpieces, using a plethora of imaginative plot elements that are now conventions, and using first-class storytelling to make a very sweet, and (rare for a science-fiction film) touching opus. ""Part II"" assumes the same visual style and imagination, but instead throws the sweeter elements out the window in favor of more gadgets, more monologues from Doc, more complications in the plot, and more kinetic energy. Despite all of this, however, it comes off as very exhilarating. ""Part II"" is really an old-fashioned sort of time-travel movie, but is done with such zest and excitement as only a director of Zemeckis's level can give us that it puts you on the edge of your seat.I will admit, the first half-hour of the movie, the look into the far future, didn't quite ring my bell and I was a bit apprehensive. But once the plot of Biff stealing the time machine and altering the course of events comes into place, the film really picks up the tempo and keeps on going all the way until its daredevil culmination. It does not measure up to the original film, but it is very exciting and certainly more fun than the disappointing ""Back to the Future: Part III.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

The trilogy of movies are all great just like Star Wars and Indiana Jones all from the great George Lucas but the first is usually always the best of the three and I believe most would say that with bttf as well but when I saw that Delorean flying it was so awesome and now is nostalgic for me as I rewatch these movies on occasion what a great franchise,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Biff rocks,"""Back to the Future II"" is way better than people remember. Many times the second chapter of a movie trilogy is the weaker of the three.

Phenomenal Sequel,"As with the original Back to the Future, this is a story that could very easily have become another horrible adaptation of a great script. However, left in the hands of the creative team of the original, Back to the Future Part II is one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history.Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director, and with this film he gave us something completely different from the original (with a film that could easily have been a copy-and-paste of the original) that not only expands upon what the original did, but gives throwbacks to it. It's a time travel movie that's not afraid to go in every direction and, when it goes back to scenes from the previous movie, it's done so seamlessly and beautifully that it flows just as naturally as the original versions of the scenes in the first movie.Again, the chemistry from all the main actors is spot-on, the humor is on point and the tone of the film is exactly what it needs to be. It feels right at home with the original in terms of the tone and pacing, making it a near-perfect sequel. Of course, with a story like this there's going to be continuity errors (just minor ones), but honestly everything else works so seamlessly together that the continuity errors matter very little, if at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorite sequels ever in one of my favorite trilogies,"The original Back to the Future is my favorite movie of all time, so following it up was never going to be an easy task, and it'd be perfectly logical to assume it shouldn't even be attempted. That said, I'm so glad the sequels exists! This movie is so creative! It can't quite top the original, but for me personally, it gets dang close to matching it. The first act of this movie is the one most people recall, and it's what it's most known for, but ironically, it's my least favorite portion of the film. While the first half hour or so is perfectly entertaining, enjoyable, and even necessary for setting up the rest of the plot, it's after that when I feel this movie truly hits the gas! The formula gets changed up quite a bit this time around, and even when things get pretty familiar, there are new spins on them. The only thing holding this back from a perfect 10 for me is that first half hour. Some of the writing is a little clunky in the beginning and could've used a few more revisions. It's clear they wrote themselves into a corner on some small things that they had to work around. Other than that though, the writing and plot drastically improves at the beginning of the second act, and doesn't stop until the end...and what an end. If you've never seen these movies, and you're marathoning them for the first time, you will not be able to resist finishing out the trilogy. I love revisiting the experience that is Back to the Future, and part 2 is a very solid sequel, and one of my favorite sequels ever made. It's got heart pounding tension that isn't afraid to get dark at times, but is followed by great laughs to balance it out. If you haven't seen this movie or this trilogy for that matter, do yourself a favor, drop what you're doing, and binge them however you can!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

My Favorite Outing with Doc's DeLorean,"Ahh, yes. This film was probably my favorite installment of the 80's time-travel trilogy. Granted, I enjoyed more when I was younger but I still have a love for it now. I've always enjoyed this more than the other two films because of how much time-hopping we're treated to, with Zemeckis's vision of Hill Valley in 2015, an alternate 1985 in which Biff Tannen's a vile business mogul, and once again...1955. This film begins moments after the first film ended, with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returning from the future with a new and improved DeLorean to warn Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue, replacing Claudia Wells) about a future incident that ruins their son's life. Their trip brings about further problems when an elderly Biff (Thomas Wilson) discovers the time machine and uses it to make himself rich and powerful in the past.I'm always a bit confused when I read negative critic comments or poor reception for the film. As I understand, it confused audiences who weren't expecting a ""To Be Concluded"" ending to the film and may have turned audiences off to it, but even as a standalone film, PART II is great fun. I love the future sequences, with a picturesque Hill Valley populated by flying cars, hover-boards, and the campy Cafe 80's. The production design on this movie is what really gets me every time. In addition, the ILM computer effects have aged rather well considering the film was made in 1989. You can still spot the computer effects but they're never bad enough to pull you out of the film.Bob Gale returns to write the screenplay and, as such, the film has the same fun sense of humor as PART I and the characters remain true to form. Fox, Lloyd, Wilson, and Lea Thompson (as Marty's mom, Lorraine) all return to their respective roles and Elisabeth Shue steps in for Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend (though her part is limited in the film). All-in-all, this film is a classic staple of the 80's and it's fun enough that anyone and everyone could enjoy it. It's right up there with PART I as great 80's popcorn fun while PART III didn't carry on with the same feel. If by some chance you haven't seen Zemeckis's series (what's wrong with you?!), do yourself a favor and pick 'em up...especially PART II.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing.,"Honestly, I can't help but say I wasn't satisfied with this movie.  If it wasn't Biff's grandson at the start (ugh, the way he talked, it's soooo irritating), it was not having Crispin Glover reprising his role.  He was my favorite character of the first movie, and it was disappointing not having him there.  Another thing, the woman who played Marty's girlfriend...maybe I just didn't like her character, but I found the acting was just...awful. But still, it coulda been the paper-thin character. *shrugs*  Still, I had nightmares about Biff's grandson's voice...shudder.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Second act twist,"It's easy to get confused by the second installment in the Back to the Future series.  But if you're an avid BTTF buff and an attentive viewer, you will greatly enjoy the twists and turns Michael J. Fox's Marty encounters in this creative film.  We are treated to three different time periods, plus scenes that overlap from the first film.  (Hint: If you are attempting to watch Part Two before seeing Part One, give up.)The actors here are competent and entertaining, with the exception of Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, who acts pretty dense.  No worry, she's not important or central in the film; she only provides the set-up for the future time travel.We see the characters in different stages of life, which is amazingly realistic through expert make-up.  Fox plays himself, himself as an older man, his son, AND his daughter.  What a family.  The paradoxed start piling up at this point, but if you can try not to become too confused and stick around for the fun, it's a great thrill ride.  Biff and Marty duke it out in a surrealistic future, which is caused by Marty's own greedy negligence.My favorite part of the film are the scenes intercut with the first movie. It's interesting to watch Marty go back in time to fix his current problem while managing to not screw up his FIRST encounter, which we witnessed in Part One.  Follow???  It's a slick sense of deja vu.This movie is darker in tone than its predecessor, mostly due to Marty's efforts to thrawt the Evil Biff.  I enjoy it more with every viewing. It's the same with all the BTTF films--you simply catch more of the time-dependent details with multiple viewings.  Plus there's obvious repetition within the trilogy, and that lends to a sort of cohesiveness between the three.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
An Equally Fine Film,"BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART II **** After the prequel hit, director Robert Zemekis and the team take us through another adventure that is just as exciting, if not in a more intriguing sense. The story jumps from 1985 to 2015 to 1985 to 1955 as Marty McFly ultimately redeems his tampering with the future by going back to the past, all using the time machine. It's basically a continuation of the fun we all got from the first one. Christopher Lloyd returns as the scientist. Somewhat new-to-the-screen actors Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, who play Marty's parents, take a backseat in this script - in fact, Glover didn't appear in this film, as he demanded too much money for the commitment required of him.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"a fun movie, even if it's impossible to figure out","Back To The Future II starts off a little slow.  An opening trip to the future is somewhat lame, and seems like a bombardment of advertising (all sorts of brand names make their appearances in 2015 form).  It gets better as it goes on, though, and really hits it stride when Marty and the Doc return to 1955.  The movie can be impossible to figure out at times.  With the heroes in 3 different eras, villains traveling back in time, and alternate universes and paradoxes being created, it's near-impossible to keep up.  The movie tries hard to keep us in tune, though, offering up explainations in some form or another for everything that happens.  It just ends up giving your brain more exercise than your average mindless adventure/comedy flick.  Either way, most people should enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Revisit this past,"Here we go again, with my favorite movie franchises. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson return for another thrill ride into the future.In the second part, Marty and ""Doc"" are on a mission to correct problems facing Marty's future son. Though the first film was involving, intriguing, funny and interesting; it does not mean that this sequel would have the same outcome. In this case, it seemed at points throughout the film it lacked the punch that needed to gain someone's attention.The sequel had great special effects such as the skateboard flying, delorean and video waiters that were inside the cafe.""Back To The Future II"" was among my favorite films but lacked the spark that made the first my favorite.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great sequel! An Under rated Classic!,"In very few cases can a sequel hold the same magic as the first one. In Back to the Future part 2, the film makers are able to not only introduce new and exciting adventures for these characters that have grown dear to our hearts but also, review events of the first film and do an amazing job.I loved this movie just as much as the original and highly recommend it for the entire family.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie,"Back to the Future part II was a good movie and the best out of the three. Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors, was great. I loved the creators views of the future(i.e. the pockets inside out and the funky sneakers). Christopher Lloyd was ingenious as usual as the eccentric doc. Brown. I give it a 8/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Not as imaginative as Part 1, but still good fun.","Back To The Future Part 2 takes place immediately after Part 1 stopped. When Marty lands in 2015, the scene is very familiar to the one in 1955, which took place in the first one. The irony is quite amusing, but you can tell that little thought went into it. And when he returns to 1955, a lot of footage from the first one is reused, or some extra things are put in the background.In this world, everyone get's married at 30 years, for some odd reason. However, BTTF2 is still a very enjoyable and adequate sequel to Part 1 and although it may not be at classic status, it's still good fun. Slightly better than the third part to the trilogy, I give it a 7.1 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
lot more shakin goin on,"The first time I saw this I was extremely disappointed.  Not as many laughs, not as much heart, and so many problems for the characters to fix.  But after watching it 5 or 6 times it became one of the better action/adventure films I'd seen.  The main appeal for me was how it picked up right where part 1 ended.  Though four years later in real time, the actors had to put back on the same outfits, do the same lines and be in the same setting (Martys driveway).  Most of us remember Docs ""theres gotta be something done about your kids"" that ended the last movie.  They head off to 2015 and after Martys business with his kids is taken care of in an elaborate chase on flying skateboards (I loved those things), he buys a book detailing the outcomes of sporting events from the previous 50 years.  Doc is outraged at Martys desire to take it back and place bets to fatten his bank account and throws it away.  It ends up in the hands of our favorite bully Biff (now 77) and he reeks havoc with it after commandeering the briefly unoccupied Delorean.  All the mayhem Biff causes leads Marty and Doc back in time to fix it, and oddly enough...they end up back at the exact same week in 1955 of Martys first adventure!  How convenient!  It was the only way the filmmakers could use the truly clever idea of re-witnessing the first movie from another angle as Marty has to do work out of view of his ""other self."" Though totally unbelievable that Biff would choose that date to go back to so he could give himself the sports book, its extremely well done and something we've never seen in a movie.  But as soon as the problem with Biff is squared away, theres a dramatic set up for a third movie!  The groan let out by the audience I was with was warranted as it was a little annoying. As far as the future scenes go, they were pretty impressive.  The expected high tech gadgets are featured and they'll definately raise your eyebrows. The overall effects are great as many of the actors have to do scenes with themselves sometimes, like when Fox plays 3 at once.  Theres also a lot of scenes from the original film parodied here and the only way to get em is to have seen part 1 numerous times.  From what I heard Shue replaced Wells as Jennifer because of ""personal problems"" and Glover didnt show up because he wanted Michael J. Fox type money.  He got it when he sued Speilberg for using footage of him from part 1 without permission.  What a weiner.  So though not as good as the first trip, this is still enjoyable for film fans who like movies that keep them on their toes.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Saved Entirely By Its Sturdy Third Act,"Quite a drop in quality if not so much in entertainment value, Back to the Future II picks up right where its predecessor signed off and continues the adventures of Marty & Doc as they journey into the future & past in this goofy, amusing & over-the-top sequel that surely lacks the freshness of the original yet delivers a bumpy but fun ride.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film's vision of the future is far more cartoonish than expected, and the poorly dated effects, corny treatment & exaggerated acts don't help either. It's only when they make their way back into the past again that things begins to improve and the film starts regaining its lost touch. The third act is its saving grace.The futuristic set pieces don't exude the same level of excitement that sci-fi relics of the first film did, and the dystopian present they return to is an overkill as well. The premise is nonetheless interesting, expertly structured and the way it merges with previous chapter's events is riveting to watch. Performances are a step down this time around but still serviceable.Overall, Back to the Future II has its share of negatives and exhibits shortcomings of its own making but it still offers a blockbuster extravaganza that many viewers won't complain about. While much more ambitious than the first film, this follow-up chapter fails to execute it all with same finesse as before, and is an inferior end product that finds its sure footing only in the final act.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing Sequel That Confuses More Than Entertains,"""Back to the Future II"" is a jumping-jack of a movie that becomes too smart for its own good real fast.  Fox and Lloyd are now in 1985, but jump to 2015.  Then they jump back to 1985 and then to 1955.  All this mayhem is somewhat intriguing and fun, but becomes a bit tedious and turns into an endurance test rather than a movie experience.  The screenplay and direction are fair at best and this detracts from the performances of the likeable cast.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"explanation of ""error"" in movie.","it's really simple... they went to the future, saw what was going to happen, came back to the exact same time that they left from, and then went on to have kids.  That is how they were able to have kids in the future even though they left before they even got married..  did I confuse anyone yet?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the original.,"The first Back to the Future was charming and funny.  Although the directors certainly could have written another great movie, they wrote themselves into a case of bad sequel with the joke/cliffhanger they ended the first movie with.  Starting out into the future, the movie will bring us to an alternate and seriously screwed up 1985 with bully Biff as the local billionaire, and back to 1955 to witness events from the original movie with another cliffhanger ending, this time to lead into the final future movie.The idea of going back to witness events from the first movie is certainly creative, and is probably the best sequence in the movie, but the Bob's have lost the charm and humor that made the original great.  Still though, this is pretty good for a sequel.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The Best Sequel,"Of course, BTTF2 isn't as good the original, but it is still a great movie. This is one exception where the sequel is either better or is just as good as the original (kind of like The Empire Strikes Back was better than Star Wars). Although this movie is very dark and complicated, it still has the same great material that made the first BTTF such an awesome movie. If you've seen BTTF1, be sure to see BTTF2!!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A movie about BIFF!!!,"I once saw this movie years ago and thought it was mediocre. As an average follow up to the original. I was a snob...but now I've seen the light. This movie is not about Marty, Doc, and their struggles. It's better than that silliness. Now I realize how cool the movie is. It's all about Biff! And Biff is rad. We all wish we could be Biff...hotel Biff, museum Biff, the world according to Biff. My favorite scene that says everything about Biff...he taunts some neighborhood children then throws their ball onto the second floor deck of a house...makes me laugh out loud everytime. Hey, you don't believe me? What are you looking at butthead? Make like a tree and get out of here if you don't agree with me OK?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A timeless (pun intended=) thrill ride!!!!,"OK, OK, so I *know* that those who saw the first movie *first* like it the most. And though I saw the first one first I was really young (like 6 or 7) and didn't appreciate it as much as I would've if I had been a bit older.So, because of this...Back To The Future Part II is still my fave! To me, it is the most creative and suspenseful of the three...one of the most exciting being when Marty is hanging from a rope above a stage while trying to stop Biff's friends from slugging 'the other Marty' while 'the other Marty' is playing ""Johnny Be Good""! Magic! I loved how (although those people always stuck on factual movie errors would have a field day with this one) the film seemed to try *so* hard to reenact every part of the first movie correctly.  Even the fact that you can tell that some parts are actually from the first and *not* reenacted is cute. Like right after, ""Hey,you,get your damn hands off her..."" when Biff gets punched...His haircut is slightly different than from the rest of the movie.What I liked most about the plot is that it twisted more than a Twizzler! I love when movies do this! It keeps you at the edge of your toes... People who say it is too confusing...it is probably for some, but after having seen it over 100 billion times, it is real easy to follow! =) No, really. I mean, I know there will always be goofs regarded as plot holes for this film, as for any time travel movie. But, until such a phenomenon can be invented, there will always be arguments like..."" Well, uh, if Biff changed everything in the past, how come he was still alive in the future?"", or what not.It's still important to use as much logic and intelligence as possible when making a film like this.As far as thinking it through on these terms, I like how this one was still a lot more accurate than the first Back To The Future, where Marty holding up a photograph of his siblings disappearing head-first would never happen. Since each action could make a difference and create its own alternate reality, as Doc described, a person's existence (or hand!) cannot be semi-visible or almost non-existent, since it either ""is"" or ""isn't"" there.I just want to add that I love the character (and the actor who plays him) of Biff!!!  I don't think any of the other flicks he plays in for the rest of his life will come close to the charisma ""Biff"" has! Michael J.Fox, is of course, inexpendable in his role, and all the rest of the cast is great. 'I love that Flea (from Red Hot CP)is in this movie, he's ""Needles"".There's only one really annoying part: at the beginning, the really pretty lady who played Jennifer in the first was replaced by Liz Shue, who says (probably the worst line of her career, definitely the worst line of the movie) ""Marty, what do you mean, the future? How can we be in the future?!""In conclusion, this film is the most exciting and suspenseful (clock tower scene and all) film of the trilogy.....(Part III was a little too mellow and plain.) PLEASE  SEE PART II!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FOOTNOTE: If you're like me, who *loves* movies that deal with the suggestion of time travel to revolve around the plot, without a B-grade 'metallic' costume and set design quality, with great acting, PLEASE GO TO THE VIDEO STORE RIGHT NOW, AND WATCH 12 MONKEYS, if you haven't already seen. This is my favourite time travel movie. You will be surprised at how much of a range Bruce Willis has, and of course, the delightful absurdity of Brad Pitt's character.Now, ""Make like a tree, and get out of here!""-Sep",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A sequel that rules!,"This movie was my favorite of all the BTTF-titles. It's a very great movie and very inspiring. Most sequels just suck, but this is a glorious exception! I would say that this is even more exciting than the prequel because it takes place in the future, which means that you will be confronted with countless new discoveries in effects and technology.It's kind of ironic, but after a few years, i began to realize that this whole movie is made upon a flaw (at least to conventional thought), because if Marty McFly and his girlfriend are traveling to the future - then they CAN'T be there! They would arrive in a future where they are not existent, because they left years ago to be there at that point. :-DNevertheless, it's a very powerful movie and i love it. It's unique and I would recommend it to everyone. A typical creative 80s-90s movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
This time it's back to the past,"The sequel to ""Back to the Future"" has Marty and Doc traveling to the year 2015 to save Marty's kids.  Seeing Biff as an old man in the future was hilarious, but he stole a sports almanac and gave it to the 1955 Biff so he could bet on sporting events and always win.  In the alternate 1985, Biff is a rich business tycoon.  What a scary world!  One character who we are introduced to (even though she is never shown, just heard) is Biff's cranky grandmother.  ""Biff, where ya goin?""  It was just funny how Biff would always get upset with her.  I mean who wouldn't.  I'm sure glad I don't have any grandmas like that. This is a wonderful film for people ages 9 and up.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
They're back!,"***Starring: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson, and Lea Thompson.The last movie left off with such a happy ending and a great way to end a movie.  Now that they made a sequel, it should add equal to the first.  I can't say that it does, but it is right behind it.  Back to the Future Part II starts with Marty McFly and Doc traveling *to* the future.  The year is 2015, flying cars and a Jaws 19 is already made.  Marty has acquired a sports almanac that tells him the stats for any game, to the year 2000.  A big money item.  A very older Biff steals the almanac, travels to 1955 and gives it to the younger Biff.  Marty and Doc must travel back to 1955 (Coincidentally the same night as that dance in the first) and retrieve the almanac.  The movie has an equal amount of comedy and so much little things that happen (""I think he stole your wallet"") that makes it so smart.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the best part II,"Have anyone noticed Martys meeting with the clock-tower guy in the year 2015 saves Martys final future? Without the almanac he knows about the world series results. I think that the accident with the roles Royce is a crucial part that should have played a bigger role in the movie. Even if the accident should happen, he would look forward to the year 2015 to bet some money on the Cobbie's! Poor Biff.. Think about what he missed.. . The main villain... And I hope the rumors is true.. There will be a part 4! And I think its OK, what is happening today... just think about wats happening today.. Today Today.. Its America Okay!

Better and visually superior than the first.,"Hard-working Robert Zemeckis proves himself yet again. I consider him the greatest director of all time, even better than Spielberg.Continues where the first one left off.Doc Brown tells Marty McFly that he must go back to future to prevent his son from being an accomplice to a robbery. The plan is to pose as his son and say no to Griff Tannen (grandson to Biff Tannen).Unfortunately, things get worse when the almanac Marty buys at an antique store falls into the hands of Biff. Biff sneaks into the time machine and travels back in time to his younger self in 1955 and hands him the almanac and warns him of a visit from Marty and to keep the almanac in a safe.Marty returns back to his time in 1985 and is horrified that it has been altered by Biff.Will Marty be able to recover the almanac from Biff and restore time as it was before? Watch the film to find out how.Heart-thumping background musical score, excellent photography and special-effects, and an interesting plot make the sequel even better than the original.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Wow !!! What a movie !!!,"This is the long awaited sequel to Back to the Future. Now, Marty must go in 2015 in order to save is own life and the future of his future childrens. Like most of the sequels in a trilogy (except the amazing Empire Strikes Back) this one is not as good as the original but it delivers! It got amazing special effects and again highly imaginative script from Bob Gale and Robert Zemekis. This movie doesn't stop to captivate us and you'll want to see this one over and over !!!I give it ***1/2 out of *****",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
GREAT SEQUEL TO A FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!,"This movie is just as good as the first which is the greatest film ever. I really liked the time lines in the movie my fave scenes were in the year 2015 the alternate Hill Valley was cool also. Everyone puts this one down as the ""weakest of the trilogy"" and I have no idea why it is one of the funnest movies ever. All in all this movie is highly reccomended of course to see it you have to see the first one or you'll be lost.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Loved it,"There actually was a beginning middle and end to this installment. They just constructed it differently. But it had the basics - Intro, Conflict, Resolution.. Intro to the future, Conflict being Biff and the adventure it took to stop him, and Resolution - stopping Biff, and burning the almanac. The difference with this film, is that after it ended - it started again with Doc getting zapped away, knowing there would be a third installment... Like the show Quantam Leap - It always ended with the beginning of next week's show. That is what this movie did.. We're just not used to seeing movies do this, so many people don't ""get it"". Personally, I think its great :-)As for humor- This sequel may not have been ""funnier"", but it's obvious it wasn't supposed to be. It told a story, and if you sit back and forget about the fact that none of this could ever happen - It's fun throwing logic out the window for a few hours, and pretending it all could. I thought it was well done for a fantasy story, and had a lot of ""meat."" it was constantly moving, where the first one flowed nicely but had no reason to be as complex.. This movie was a lot quicker, and I guess that confused some people? ah well... it worked for me. If you love the concept and story of the first, this one is a treat.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A respectable sequel..,A solid sequel of the original. Has similiar elements and plot devices to it. Half ot it felt like a rehased version of the original.Solid story with good writing and directing. The time traveling gets even more confusing. The characters are decent. Seeing the future of the Marty family wsas quiet interesting and Biff played a good role being an antaonigst. The visuals and the music were good also.Overall an enjoyable filmMemorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Three Back to the Future movies, a great trilogy, 1985, 1989, 1990.","The BTTF movies, I think, should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films. Plus Thomas Wilson as the various Tannen characters, his great characterizations are too easily taken for granted.The Delorean time machine Doc created is the ""vehicle"" that supports three unique stories in the Trilogy. Most of the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science"", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.In part I, while helping Doc test the time machine in an empty mall parking lot at 2AM, Marty quite accidentally goes back to 1955, to a time where Doc had just discovered the flux capacitor and Marty's eventual parents were to get together at the big high school dance. When Lorraine, again accidentally, gets a crush on Marty he has to repair things to keep from changing his future.In Part II Marty and Doc have to travel to 2015 to keep the future kids out of trouble but a 78-yr-old Biff gets a sports almanac and steals the time machine to give it to his 18-yr-old self in 1955. The resultant gambling and wealth changed history for the worse and Marty and Doc had to use detective work and cunning to set things straight.In part III Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate.To me, thre is no value in judging which of the three movies is ""better"". Each one uses the main characters to create three distinctly different stories. I like to look at them as one long 3-part movie and we periodically watch all three on successive nights. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.In 2015 I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great Film... Confusing?  If you're really simple-minded,"this wuz a great sequel to ""Back to the Future.""  Part II wuz clearly more ambitious in creativity and execution than Part I.  Whereas Part I focused on the evolution on George McFly's character, Part II focused A LOT more on the rammifications of time travel.  Truly, getting back to the future wuz only the beginning.the vision of the future wuz very understandable, considering the time the movie wuz made.  true, it'z kinda dated for today, but it's still a lot of fun to watch... especially with all the visual references to pop culture & the first movie...i like the fact that the dark, orwellian future wasn't 2015, but 1985... it wuz a nice departure of seeing a dark future... that'd be scary, but wut if your own present is a complete hell hole...thingz would be really screwed...then of course the great thing about BTTF 2 wuz how the plot of trying to get the Sports Almanac tied so well to the events of Part I... everything from Marty & Doc trying to avoid their other selves, Marty witnessing George's punch, and his going behind himself playing ""Johnny B. Goode""...The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy's main focus is on time travel... however it is Part 2 that really shows the effects, difficulties, and overall insanity and science of time travel.  Part I and III are great too... Part I has the theme of ""coming-of-age"" & ""nostalgia"" and Part III has the ""western"" and ""romantic blindness"", which are all great... but it'z Part II that has the true science-fiction/time travel feel to it, and executes it with creativity & intelligence...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
